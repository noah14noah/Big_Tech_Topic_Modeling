That includes the sig...</p><p>AT&amp;T is reportedly propping up a call by President Donald Trump for greater web oversight via net neutrality-like regulations. The US president has called for transparency from big tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. That includes the signing of an executive order geared at sending complaints about purported bias from social media and search giants alike to the FTC. In this case, the aim is the removal of 'anti-conservative' bias.   The Trump administration has further petitioned the FCC to reinterpret Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in order to limit protections for hosting sites. In effect, opening online platforms to legal action when platforms take down or alter content they deem objectionable. That would include sites like Twitter , which recently began flagging some of the president's statements.   Now, AT&amp;T has taken to its official blog stating that argument is the most important \"neutrality\" debate. What is AT&amp;T saying about web \"neutrality\"?  The primary argument from AT&amp;T on neutrality for the web has nothing to do with earlier debates about net neutrality though. In fact, AT&amp;T was one of the carriers to side with the Trump administration's FCC in gutting those rules.   AT&amp;T notes that a total of five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google \u2014 make up 25-percent of the S&amp;P 500. And that the company's make decisions on a daily basis that shape America's economic, social, and political life. But, it argues, those decisions are effectively made in a void, away from public view.   To that end, it argues that online platforms should be more transparent about those decisions. But the carrier took things quite a bit further as well. While the full extent of its proposal has not been published yet, the carrier also wants active enforcement. Chiefly, it wants the FCC to force changes in moderation of content. Summarily, it wants the same legal ramifications to apply to tech companies like Google that apply to traditional publishing platforms. How likely is this to happen?  For now, there is stiff opposition to reducing legal protections for online platforms. Those are largely based in First Amendments groundings and supported not just by FCC Democrats. Commissioner Michael O'Rielly has voiced concerns on that front too. It also remains unclear whether or not the FCC has the authority under Congress to enforce any such interpretation of Section 230.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42993322277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RW-YK31-JCSC-J26Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"451\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>AndroidHeadlines</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

Republicans indignantly opposed regulating Internet service, currently dominated by a few cable giants. Texas Republican <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>called it \"Obamacare for the Internet\" (in his world, fightin' words).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers' passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishing fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p> So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p> But there's another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month's astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company's monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p> High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p> Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well: Avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in the Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names - Google, Facebook, Microsoft - didn't fight against the net neutrality decision \"because they didn't want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\"</p><p> (Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p> In the real world, these big content providers have been for - not against - net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \"a grave threat to the Internet.\" Did they make themselves clear?</p><p> As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Googleand the others didn't rush into the fray. She told Wired they \"risked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\"</p><p> Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don't seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn't be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p> Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies' investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p> \"They wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\" Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Googleis pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That's because Google's business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of GoogleFiber said the impending FCC decision \"did not have any specific impact on (Google's) plans to build more Fiber cities.\"</p><p> All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position. What's left for the pure ideologues is a bowl of kibbles about the evils of regulation and the selfless good deeds of corporations. That bowl never empties.</p><p> Froma Harrop is a columnist for Creators Syndicate. Follow her on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

Republicans indignantly opposed regulating Internet service, currently dominated by a few cable giants. Texas Republican Ted Cruz called it \u201cObamacare for the Internet\u201d (in his world, fightin' words).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">------------</p><p> The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers' passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishing fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p> ------------</p><p> So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p> ------------</p><p> But there's another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month's astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company's monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p> ------------</p><p> High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft \u2014 didn't fight against the net neutrality decision \u201cbecause they didn't want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\u201d</p><p> ------------</p><p> (Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p> ------------</p><p> In the real world, these big content providers have been for \u2014 not against \u2014 net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \u201ca grave threat to the Internet.\u201d Did they make themselves clear?</p><p> ------------</p><p> As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Google and the others didn't rush into the fray. She told Wired they \u201crisked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\u201d</p><p> ------------</p><p> Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don't seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn't be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies' investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p> ------------</p><p> \u201cThey wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\u201d Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Google is pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That's because Google's business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of Google Fiber said the impending FCC decision \u201cdid not have any specific impact on (Google's) plans to build more Fiber cities.\u201d</p><p> ------------</p><p> All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position. What's left for the pure ideologues is a bowl of kibbles about the evils of regulation and the selfless good deeds of corporations. That bowl never empties.</p><p> ------------</p><p> Froma Harrop's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fharrop@gmail.com\">fharrop@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYHLD-82fd8ee7576fc1fddaf43ac5ec4d4ea3db44c6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYHLD2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FDY-5101-JD6S-R154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388133</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Daily Herald, Everett, WA All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Herald (Everett, Washington)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 3, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Laws, Internet &amp;

In 2015, the F.C.C. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-vote-internet-utility.html\">voted</url> to prohibit those charges, in a policy often called net neutrality.</p><p>But Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated for the chairmanship by President Trump, said the regulations were heavy-handed and prevented telecom companies from pursuing new business models. His proposal, by stripping away the existing rules, would allow telecom companies to charge websites to deliver their data at higher speeds.</p><p>In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Pai addressed some of the concerns that have been voiced since he released his proposal, pointing specifically to comments by celebrities like <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/cher/status/933169732622065665?lang=en\">Cher</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/kumailn/status/933017486026457088?lang=en\">Kumail Nanjiani</url> of \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d He said their tweets warning that his rules would lead to authoritarianism and a handout to big cable companies were \u201cutterly absurd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to cut through hysteria and hot air and speak in plain terms about the plan,\u201d Mr. Pai said, adding that the plan would bring back the regulation-free policy that helped the internet thrive. He said big tech companies might be a bigger threat to online speech than telecom companies.</p><p>The proposal is expected to be approved at a meeting of the five F.C.C. commissioners on Dec. 14. The two other Republican commissioners have already expressed their support for Mr. Pai.</p><p>The 2015 rules also elicited strong interest. The F.C.C. site was overwhelmed with comments after a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU\">monologue</url> from the late-night host John Oliver went viral online. Some people who wanted the stronger rules blocked the driveway of the chairman at the time, Tom Wheeler, to try to persuade him to change the agency\u2019s plan.</p><p>Big web companies like Google and Netflix played activist roles as well, supporting the stronger rules. They argued that telecom companies should not be able to split sites into fast lanes and slow lanes, because that would allow them to become a sort of gatekeeper for information and entertainment. In addition, they say, it would hurt start-ups without the money to pay for the faster lanes.</p><p>Mr. Pai, who opposed the rules as a commissioner in 2015, gave broad outlines of his plans early this year. For months, comments to the F.C.C. website piled up, to more than 20 million. President Barack Obama\u2019s clean power plan, perhaps his biggest policy change at the Environmental Protection Agency, attracted 4.3 million comments over six months.</p><p>But the intensity has increased even more since Mr. Pai released the details of the proposal \u2014 perhaps in part because few people expected him to try to strip all of the existing rules.</p><p>\u201cWe never expected this,\u201d wrote Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson.</p><p>Lawmakers, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MarkRuffalo/status/933059877743755265\">celebrities</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/934130104665591808\">founders</url> of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/933490344624304130\">start-ups</url> and consumers have continued to hash out the debate into this week.</p><p>Conservative groups like FreedomWorks and the Competitive Enterprise Institute praised the rollback. The radio host Rush Limbaugh defended Mr. Pai\u2019s plan on Monday in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2017/11/27/net-neutrality-explained-via-professor-hazletts-great-book-the-political-spectrum/\">online post</url>. He dismissed concerns by supporters of the rules, whom he described as liberal \u201cmillennials and tech bloggers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the tech bloggers and the left don\u2019t like is that there are options and that there is a freedom in the marketplace and that people can choose superior service if they\u2019re willing to pay for it,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd if somebody\u2019s willing to pay for superior service, the providers had better provide it.\u201d</p><p>Public interest groups like Free Press and organizations like Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the popular Firefox browser, said they were prepared to file suit against the plan as soon as the vote on Dec. 14.</p><p>\u201cThe action hit a nerve because the internet is central to the vast majority of people\u2019s daily lives, and so people were very eager to understand what was happening over the weekend,\u201d said Denelle Dixon, chief legal officer for Mozilla.</p><p>The reaction from the biggest tech companies, however, has been noticeably subdued. Instead of forceful pleas from their executives, like those in years past on this issue, they are largely speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, which has expressed disappointment over Mr. Pai\u2019s plan.</p><p>\u201cInternet companies are firm supporters of the 2015 Open Internet Order and will continue our push for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules going forward,\u201d said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association. \u201cWe are reviewing the draft order and weighing our legal options.\u201d</p><p>Taking their place are start-ups such as Airbnb, Twitter and Reddit, which joined dozens of smaller start-ups on Monday warning Mr. Pai that the rules would hurt innovation and the economy.</p><p>Sorting out the real individual commenters from fake or automated accounts is far more tricky. The F.C.C. said it did not have the resources to investigate every comment on its site.</p><p>Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that after a six-month investigation, his office had found that the identities of tens of thousands of state residents were fraudulently used to post comments to the F.C.C.</p><p>\u201cIf law enforcement can\u2019t investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale,\u201d Mr. Schneiderman said, \u201cthe door is open for it to happen again and again.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, said he was targeted by threats and ethnic slurs after the agency sought to repeal net neutrality rules.

To get them really worked up, make the topic internet regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the week since the Federal Communications Commission released a plan to scrap existing rules for internet delivery, more than 200,000 phone calls, organized through online campaigns, have been placed to Congress in protest. An additional 500,000 comments have been left on the agency's website. On social media sites like Twitter and Reddit, the issue has been a leading topic of discussion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In some cases, views on the sweeping change, which would repeal landmark regulations meant to ensure an open internet, have turned into personal attacks. The agency's chairman, Ajit Pai, said threatening calls and emails had poured into his home and his wife's work. An image of a protest poster with his children's names was posted online and spread widely. Ethnic slurs aimed at Mr. Pai, whose parents immigrated from India, littered his Twitter feed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are also echoes of the 2016 presidential election, with accusations that not all of the reaction is coming from Americans. The federal agency is for the first time dealing with a powerful technology foe as automated software, known as bots, appears to have sent many comments to the site, according to data researchers.</p><p>And at least 400,000 comments about the issue since April on the F.C.C. site appear to have originated from an apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency said. It is unclear whether the emails did originate from there, or were made to look as if they did.</p><p>But none of that has overshadowed the heated reaction to the agency's proposal.</p><p>\"There doesn't seem to be middle ground on this issue,\" said John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation.</p><p>At the center of the debate is whether telecom companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon should be able to charge internet sites for delivering their data to consumers' homes. In 2015, the F.C.C. voted to prohibit those charges, in a policy often called net neutrality.</p><p>But Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated for the chairmanship by President Trump, said the regulations were heavy-handed and prevented telecom companies from pursuing new business models.

The F.C.C. site was overwhelmed with comments after a monologue from the late-night host John Oliver went viral online.

In addition, they say, it would hurt start-ups without the money to pay for the faster lanes.</p><p>Mr. Pai, who opposed the rules as a commissioner in 2015, gave broad outlines of his plans early this year. For months, comments to the F.C.C. website piled up, to more than 20 million. President Barack Obama's clean power plan, perhaps his biggest policy change at the Environmental Protection Agency, attracted 4.3 million comments over six months.</p><p>But the intensity has increased even more since Mr. Pai released the details of the proposal - perhaps in part because few people expected him to try to strip all of the existing rules.</p><p>\"We never expected <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">this</emphasis>,\" wrote Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson.</p><p>Lawmakers, celebrities, founders of start-ups and consumers have continued to hash out the debate into this week.</p><p>Conservative groups like FreedomWorks and the Competitive Enterprise Institute praised the rollback. The radio host Rush Limbaugh defended Mr. Pai's plan on Monday in an online post. He dismissed concerns by supporters of the rules, whom he described as liberal \"millennials and tech bloggers.\"</p><p>\"What the tech bloggers and the left don't like is that there are options and that there is a freedom in the marketplace and that people can choose superior service if they're willing to pay for it,\" Mr. Limbaugh said. \"And if somebody's willing to pay for superior service, the providers had better provide it.\"</p><p>Public interest groups like Free Press and organizations like Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the popular Firefox browser, said they were prepared to file suit against the plan as soon as the vote on Dec. 14.</p><p>\"The action hit a nerve because the internet is central to the vast majority of people's daily lives, and so people were very eager to understand what was happening over the weekend,\" said Denelle Dixon, chief legal officer for Mozilla.</p><p>The reaction from the biggest tech companies, however, has been noticeably subdued. Instead of forceful pleas from their executives, like those in years past on this issue, they are largely speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, which has expressed disappointment over Mr. Pai's plan.</p><p>\"Internet companies are firm supporters of the 2015 Open Internet Order and will continue our push for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules going forward,\" said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association. \"We are reviewing the draft order and weighing our legal options.\"</p><p>Taking their place are start-ups such as Airbnb, Twitter and Reddit, which joined dozens of smaller start-ups on Monday warning Mr. Pai that the rules would hurt innovation and the economy.</p><p>Sorting out the real individual commenters from fake or automated accounts is far more tricky. The F.C.C. said it did not have the resources to investigate every comment on its site.</p><p>Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that after a six-month investigation, his office had found that the identities of tens of thousands of state residents were fraudulently used to post comments to the F.C.C.</p><p>\"If law enforcement can't investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale,\" Mr. Schneiderman said, \"the door is open for it to happen again and again.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005575227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2M-RP01-JC85-N1TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1205\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 28, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC00028V1</classCode><className>SKADDEN ARPS SLATE MEAGHER &amp;

Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon- which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use - can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports.</p><p>The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anti-competitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still - and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve.</p><p>Read more</p><p>Net neutrality: Federal appeals court deals blow to telecoms companies</p><p>Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook - lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with <person><nameText>Sen. Ed Markey, </nameText></person>a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality.</p><p>Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules.</p><p>Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time.</p><p>The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflixand Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback.</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai travelled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.)</p><p>Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.)</p><p>At least one big supporter of net neutrality - Netflix- has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\"</p><p>The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause.</p><p>In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet.</p><p>Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped.</p><p>In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue.</p><p>For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate.</p><p>And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. \"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago.</p><p>\"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom.</p><p>Copyright Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-34703704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5ND9-SKH1-JCJY-G0SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><timeReceived>11:38 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 26, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The vote is likely to be futile because President Donald Trump has signaled that he'll veto the legislation even if it manages to pass in the Senate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While both Democrats and Republicans support net neutrality principles, there is little prospect of a legislative resolution in the current environment. That's unlikely to change without a more honest and open discussion in the halls of Congress and the media.</p><p>Journalist Matt Taibbi's new book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hate Inc.</emphasis>, which posits that we've been \"herded into separate demographic pens\" on the \"spectrum of permissible thought,\" offers a convincing explanation for the parties' apparently irreconcilable split on net neutrality legislation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Narrowing Debate's Parameters</emphasis></p><p>Advocacy groups have largely succeeded in narrowing the range of permissible net neutrality argument to a binary choice - whether or not to reinstate a 2015 Democratic party-line vote for so-called Title II common-carrier regulation at the FCC - a choice that demands total victory for one side and total defeat for the other. When neither option is acceptable to both parties, stalemate is the expected result.</p><p>Progress toward a lasting solution would require a change in the prevailing narrative about what is needed for \"strong\" net neutrality regulation, but as Taibbi notes, \"the scripts in societies like ours rarely change.\" Anyone who attempts to stray too far outside the \"permitted mental parameters\" of the binary choice is immediately hit with \"flak\" from advocacy groups on both sides of the ideological divide.</p><p>\"As it turns out, there is a utility in keeping us divided,\" Taibbi writes. \"Fake controversies of increasing absurdity\" keep \"audiences from seeing larger problems.\"</p><p>With respect to the internet, other problems - like the systematic abuse of consumer privacy rights and the manipulation of democratic elections - are considerably larger and far more pressing than the narrow slice of issues the FCC's net neutrality regulations ostensibly addressed. Consider that the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Russian efforts to manipulate the 2016 presidential election both occurred while the FCC's 2015 regulations were in effect. Is that the internet Democrats really want to save?</p><p>The Democrats' definition of \"net neutrality\" cannot meet the lofty expectations created by those words or the unmitigated praise they so often receive in the press. It is flatly untrue that the FCC's 2015 net neutrality regulations \"ensured\" or \"guarantee[d]\" internet users would have equal and open access to all online services and content, as many mainstream media outlets have recently reported. It is an indisputable fact that the FCC's 2015 net neutrality regulations did not stop dominant internet platforms from restricting access to particular internet services and content, because the regulations did not apply to all internet platforms that have the incentive and ability to act as gatekeepers.</p><p>The internet is like a canal with multiple locks, any one of which can be used to deny access to websites and services that are upstream from an end user. If the law required that only one lock on the Panama Canal be kept open to all shipping, its other locks could still be used to block any particular ship from passing through. Smartphones and search engines are metaphorical locks on the internet canal; and each has been used to discriminate against content and services on the web.</p><p>This plain truth has been trampled by advocates who repeatedly assert that the FCC's 2015 regulations are the only viable path to \"strong\" net neutrality. Whenever someone points out that a truly strong approach to net neutrality regulation would prohibit any platform company from using any type of internet lock to control access to content and services, the same advocates complain that person is \"changing the subject.\"</p><p>It isn't changing the subject to be concerned about the (quite literal) fact that internet platforms have the same ability and incentive as ISPs to deny access to internet content and services. Users either have equal access to internet content or they don't. When users are denied access to particular content, they don't care which internet lock was used against them. Neither should the law.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sort of flak has proven to be a successful means of choreographing the debate. Advocates for the FCC's 2015 regulations want to shut down rabble rousers (like me) who advocate for the application of net neutrality regulation to all internet companies equally, because an honest and open debate about the various types of internet locks and who controls them would expose the FCC's 2015 regulations for what they were: biased laws that let monopolistic internet platforms have their cake (by regulating their potential rivals) and eat it too (by exempting their own monopoly platforms from those regulations).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big Tech Wins Out</emphasis></p><p>Keeping the one-sided net neutrality debate going is a win for big tech platforms even without a regulatory response. The debate provides enough threat of regulation to make ISPs think twice about trying new business models that could be spun as net neutrality offenses. And while ISPs fret, big tech companies fill the void with their own service offerings, many of which actually do violate net neutrality principles. But big tech companies get away with it, because they've established a narrative that exempts themselves from serious net neutrality scrutiny.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W08-6331-DY5H-100H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XL</volume><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 29, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rules &amp;

But Rome wasn't built in a day -- and we can't rely on the path of least resistance to protect a free and open internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The battle for net neutrality started almost two decades ago and to see this through to an ethical and equitable solution, we must have a permanent law on the books preventing any internet provider or tech company from blocking websites, manipulating or sharing data, or discriminating online.</p><p>Right now, much of the energy is being focused on a quick-fix process in Congress called the Congressional Review Act, or CRA. Strongly supported by Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the CRA unfortunately will not create permanent statutory protection for net neutrality. While it might restore earlier Federal Communications Commission regulations on the issue, they will still be vulnerable to future partisan challenges.</p><p>Utilizing the CRA option will only serve to extend the conflict rather than bringing it to a close.</p><p>The 2015 version of net neutrality that the CRA would restore is strong in some ways, but harmful in others -- most importantly it relies on obsolete utility-style regulation that many believe will make it harder to build new networks and connect communities that don't have access to high speed broadband. </p><p>Back in 2015, the NAACP and the Communications Workers of America warned against this version of neutrality and predicted it could put hundreds of thousands of broadband jobs at risk by driving away investment. One study found that this version of the rules could eliminate as much as $30 billion a year in network investment.</p><p>Similarly, local efforts in both Missouri and Kansas to protect net neutrality at the state level are also doomed to fail. There is only one internet, and state-by-state broadband laws will create a mismatched framework of conflicting standards that will bog down the internet and drain resources needed to connect underserved neighborhoods, speed up the internet for everyone and close the digital divide for good. </p><p>Even worse, both the CRA and statutes currently proposed in Kansas and Missouri offer only partial protection for internet users -- completely exempting the big tech social media and search giants that shape and influence so much of what we can do and see online.</p><p>Consumers are keenly aware that our online experiences are increasingly curated by search and media platforms that track and monetize our every click. And now, through the probe of Facebook's role in the 2016 elections, we are already grappling with the implications of the control big tech and social media platforms have over our personal data and the ethical and legal implications of the ways they monetize that information and influence decision-making.</p><p>Google, for example, has already been fined $2.7 billion for discriminating in its search results by favoring its own services and smothering competitors. And Amazon just patented new technology to prevent consumers in its physical stores (including the nearly 500 Whole Foods locations it just bought) from using store Wi-Fi to compare prices.</p><p>Even more alarming is that many of these types of platforms seem built on algorithms that pick and choose what we see and experience online, yet are overwhelmingly run by white and male employees who seem oblivious to basic requirements of fairness and equality online.</p><p>The social implications are profound. One study found that users with African-American identifying names are 25 percent more likely to receive ads involving arrest records and background checks. Another by Carnegie Mellon University found that Google searches show higher paying jobs to men than to women. We need an information ecosystem where society's needs and basic principles of openness and equality shape our opportunities and experiences online, not predatory monopolies and antiquated biases.</p><p>Big tech and social media companies are critical actors with the ability to make the internet more inclusive and welcoming or divisive and hateful. </p><p>Instead of half measures that exempt big tech, we need comprehensive federal net neutrality legislation that requires fair play, transparency, equal competition and an end to viewpoint discrimination, censorship, harassment or abuse everywhere online. This is vital for an industry that has such a poor track record on questions of equal opportunity, open competition, and diversity. </p><p>The sponsors of the CRA bill like McCaskill mean well, but only permanent federal legislation can address the holistic needs of the internet ecosystem and fairly regulate all parties to effectively protect our communities and the internet itself.</p><p>Amy Hinojosa is president and CEO of MANA, A National Latina Organization. MANA's mission is to empower Latinas through leadership development, community service and advocacy. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KCSTAR-B9716851008Z1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KCSTAR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7C-FW01-DYJM-M0VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"814\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Kansas City Star All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Kansas City Star</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11093\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 1, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RED</classCode><className>INTERNET SERVICE REGULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008WWI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

This principle could be used to deter ISPs such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon from censoring websites they do not like or opinions they may not agree with.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Net neutrality ultimately levels the playing field and allows a website such as Facebook to go from a small startup developed by college students to the world's largest social network.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It also allows people of all backgrounds and opinions to be able to share their thoughts without being censored. Net neutrality is the reason that people can access any legal site they want. Net neutrality has allowed the Internet to truly further the human experience and enrich lives, as well as allow the freedom that most people who use the Web experience, including the dissemination of popular culture, memes, instant messages and education.</p><p>There have been many cases of ISPs partaking in practices that shy away from the principles of net neutrality, and this has negative effects on the customers and users of the Internet. This is why the talks of creating legislation to make neutrality a legitimate regulatory policy have been arising.</p><p>There have been allegations of ISPs throttling the bandwidth of Netflix. In 2013, the video streaming service accounted for more than 30 percent of Internet traffic in the United States, so the ISPs would profit substantially from charging Netflix in order to have better service.</p><p>After further investigation by M-Lab in New York, it was found that all the ISPs started throttling bandwidth to Netflix services around the same time and then stopped throttling around the time that Netflix made a deal with them for better service.</p><p>This shows corruption of ISPs that crippled a company's Internet service, so they could push a company into paying more money in order to get service that should have been delivered anyway.</p><p>Another far-reaching violation of net neutrality is one carried out by AT&amp;T. According to the Federal Trade Commission, AT&amp;T throttled Internet to users who had unlimited data plans when they had high usage. This is the equivalent of users getting normal speeds up until a certain cap and getting service at a degraded quality past that cap.</p><p>Recently, there have been talks between the Federal Communications Commission and telecom companies about adopting formal policies that would move away from net neutrality. The FCC has proposed creating fast lanes that it claims would provide better, faster service to companies for a premium in order to get their service to customers at a better quality.</p><p>This claim is masking the fact that creating these fast lanes would break the neutral balance that currently makes the Internet as great as it is. A common conclusion that most people on the Internet and companies have is that these fast lanes will actually give the telecom companies the ability to shake down small businesses and producers of Internet content for more money in order to let them do business as usual - kind of like the mafia would.</p><p>It doesn't help that Thomas Wheeler, a former telecom lobbyist, is currently heading the FCC. It is very concerning that a person who has been on the telecom payroll for a long time was appointed to be the head of the FCC during the time that net neutrality is under attack.</p><p>It also is not good that our politicians are not as well informed about this issue as they need to be. Recently, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas said that having net neutrality is a regulation and is not \"bold, innovative or fair.\" This is completely wrong because having a free Internet allows for it to be more bold, innovative and fair than an Internet run by people with deep pockets, who can afford to pay to get their content to customers.</p><p>All these violations of net neutrality harm the Internet that we know and love, and we need to take the steps to put an end to this. The actions of throttling and site blocking by ISPs don't just create inconvenience to Internet users, but it also threatens the innovation and competition that has given the world services, including Facebook and YouTube.</p><p>If net neutrality disappeared, ISPs could start charging small companies more money to have a good enough connection to get their content out effectively. This barrier can stop innovation by inhibiting the ability of smaller companies and websites to compete and grow. If net neutrality had not existed a decade ago, we may not have Facebook, YouTube, reddit or any other website that probably wouldn't have had enough money to pay off an ISP during the time it was growing.</p><p>Although the fight to keep net neutrality has felt like an uphill battle, the Obama administration made some reassuring statements on the topic of net neutrality and showed support for keeping it in place, and users across the Internet have shown support for such a thing.</p><p>Even big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, have made statements about how net neutrality is necessary for the Internet to continue to be a breeding ground for creativity, innovation and social interaction.</p><p>In the White House's statement, requests were made that the FCC would strengthen net neutrality and adopt four policies that include no blocking, no throttling, increased transparency and no paid prioritization. The guidelines that the White House has requested the FCC to follow help to mitigate and solve the problems that we have seen with the blocking of websites and throttling of services. This also would protect freedom of speech by preventing the blocking of websites that have an opinion or serve an\u00a0 agenda. The next step is to take these guidelines and make them into formal legislation or regulatory policies. This needs to happen so that telecom companies will not be able to play by their own rules.</p><p>Even though users, tech companies and now even the White House have shown support for net neutrality, its fate ultimately falls onto the shoulders of the FCC. It is unfortunate that it seems the FCC is being driven by money, greed and influence of deep-pocketed telecom companies, but it is doubtful the FCC will be able to kill net neutrality with all the support to keep it in place.</p><p>The Internet is one of the most important inventions of the past century, and it affects the way people entertain themselves, do business and interact with other people. It allows any person from any background to be able to have a voice and reach out to an audience that was not reachable before its advent in an almost instantaneous manner. This wide reach and quick pace of information flow has changed the way that society interacts, from getting breaking news about a natural disaster moments after it happens to being able to send invites to friends rather than having to call all of them individually.</p><p>Net neutrality needs be mandated in formal legislation so that Internet users - current and future - will have the ability to compete and be heard. Without this legislation, the Internet is vulnerable to the corruption of the telecom giants that provide the backbone of the Web. An Internet without net neutrality is a scary thought that cannot be allowed to become a reality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-3797828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDB-3KW1-DY7P-T4MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1248\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The UTD Mercury: University of Texas - Dallas</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 17, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Net neutrality has allowed the Internet to truly further the human experience and enrich lives, as well as allow the freedom that most people who use the Web experience, including the dissemination of popular culture, memes, instant messages and education.</p><p>There have been many cases of ISPs partaking in practices that shy away from the principles of net neutrality, and this has negative effects on the customers and users of the Internet. This is why the talks of creating legislation to make neutrality a legitimate regulatory policy have been arising.</p><p>There have been allegations of ISPs throttling the bandwidth of Netflix. In 2013, the video streaming service accounted for more than 30 percent of Internet traffic in the United States, so the ISPs would profit substantially from charging Netflixin order to have better service.</p><p>After further investigation by M-Lab in New York, it was found that all the ISPs started throttling bandwidth to Netflixservices around the same time and then stopped throttling around the time that Netflixmade a deal with them for better service.</p><p>This shows corruption of ISPs that crippled a company's Internet service, so they could push a company into paying more money in order to get service that should have been delivered anyway.</p><p>Another far-reaching violation of net neutrality is one carried out by AT&amp;T. According to the Federal Trade Commission, AT&amp;T throttled Internet to users who had unlimited data plans when they had high usage. This is the equivalent of users getting normal speeds up until a certain cap and getting service at a degraded quality past that cap.</p><p>Recently, there have been talks between the Federal Communications Commission and telecom companies about adopting formal policies that would move away from net neutrality. The FCC has proposed creating fast lanes that it claims would provide better, faster service to companies for a premium in order to get their service to customers at a better quality.</p><p>This claim is masking the fact that creating these fast lanes would break the neutral balance that currently makes the Internet as great as it is. A common conclusion that most people on the Internet and companies have is that these fast lanes will actually give the telecom companies the ability to shake down small businesses and producers of Internet content for more money in order to let them do business as usual - kind of like the mafia would.</p><p>It doesn't help that Thomas Wheeler, a former telecom lobbyist, is currently heading the FCC. It is very concerning that a person who has been on the telecom payroll for a long time was appointed to be the head of the FCC during the time that net neutrality is under attack.</p><p>It also is not good that our politicians are not as well informed about this issue as they need to be. Recently, Senator Ted Cruz from Texas said that having net neutrality is a regulation and is not \"bold, innovative or fair.\" This is completely wrong because having a free Internet allows for it to be more bold, innovative and fair than an Internet run by people with deep pockets, who can afford to pay to get their content to customers.</p><p>All these violations of net neutrality harm the Internet that we know and love, and we need to take the steps to put an end to this. The actions of throttling and site blocking by ISPs don't just create inconvenience to Internet users, but it also threatens the innovation and competition that has given the world services, including Facebook and YouTube.</p><p>If net neutrality disappeared, ISPs could start charging small companies more money to have a good enough connection to get their content out effectively. This barrier can stop innovation by inhibiting the ability of smaller companies and websites to compete and grow. If net neutrality had not existed a decade ago, we may not have Facebook, YouTube, reddit or any other website that probably wouldn't have had enough money to pay off an ISP during the time it was growing.</p><p>Although the fight to keep net neutrality has felt like an uphill battle, the Obama administration made some reassuring statements on the topic of net neutrality and showed support for keeping it in place, and users across the Internet have shown support for such a thing.</p><p>Even big tech companies, including Microsoft, Google and Amazon, have made statements about how net neutrality is necessary for the Internet to continue to be a breeding ground for creativity, innovation and social interaction.</p><p>In the White House's statement, requests were made that the FCC would strengthen net neutrality and adopt four policies that include no blocking, no throttling, increased transparency and no paid prioritization. The guidelines that the White House has requested the FCC to follow help to mitigate and solve the problems that we have seen with the blocking of websites and throttling of services. This also would protect freedom of speech by preventing the blocking of websites that have an opinion or serve an\u00a0 agenda. The next step is to take these guidelines and make them into formal legislation or regulatory policies. This needs to happen so that telecom companies will not be able to play by their own rules.</p><p>Even though users, tech companies and now even the White House have shown support for net neutrality, its fate ultimately falls onto the shoulders of the FCC. It is unfortunate that it seems the FCC is being driven by money, greed and influence of deep-pocketed telecom companies, but it is doubtful the FCC will be able to kill net neutrality with all the support to keep it in place.</p><p>The Internet is one of the most important inventions of the past century, and it affects the way people entertain themselves, do business and interact with other people. It allows any person from any background to be able to have a voice and reach out to an audience that was not reachable before its advent in an almost instantaneous manner. This wide reach and quick pace of information flow has changed the way that society interacts, from getting breaking news about a natural disaster moments after it happens to being able to send invites to friends rather than having to call all of them individually.</p><p>Net neutrality needs be mandated in formal legislation so that Internet users - current and future - will have the ability to compete and be heard. Without this legislation, the Internet is vulnerable to the corruption of the telecom giants that provide the backbone of the Web. An Internet without net neutrality is a scary thought that cannot be allowed to become a reality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-1522134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FCW-YCY1-JBSN-31HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The UTD Mercury: University of Texas - Dallas</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 17, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>CMCSA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>CCV (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Dallas</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>TX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Republicans indignantly opposed regulating Internet service, currently dominated by a few cable giants. Texas Republican <person><nameText>Ted Cruz </nameText></person>called it \u201cObamacare for the Internet\u201d (in his world, fightin\u2019 words).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lobbying money and muscle of Comcast, AT&amp;T and Time Warner no doubt stoked the lawmakers\u2019 passions. And when the Federal Communications Commission voted to prevent Internet service providers from establishin g fast lanes for favored customers, its two Republican members voted against it.</p><p> So why, when the FCC said the Internet would be treated as a public utility, like telephone lines, did Republicans retreat rather than battle on? The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p> But there\u2019s another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month\u2019s astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company\u2019s monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p> High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p> Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t fight against the net neutrality decision \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\u201d</p><p> (Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p> In the real world, these big content providers have been for \u2014 not against \u2014 net neutrality.</p><p> In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \u201ca grave threat to the Internet.\u201d Did they make themselves clear?</p><p> As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Googleand the others didn\u2019t rush into the fray. She told Wired they \u201crisked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\u201d</p><p> Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don\u2019t seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn\u2019t be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p> Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies\u2019 investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p> \u201cThey wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\u201d Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Googleis pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That\u2019s because Google\u2019s business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of GoogleFiber said the impending FCC decision \u201cdid not have any specific impact on (Google\u2019s) plans to build more Fiber cities.\u201d</p><p> All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position.

Reddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back net-neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced.Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white-screen reading 'Defend Net Neutrality' in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen. </p><p>But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that bar internet service providers like AT...nd Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that supports net neutrality, said the biggest tech companies were less vocal because they were facing more regulatory battles than in past years. Social-media sites have been criticized for allowing foreign actors to interfere in the presidential election of 2016. The biggest tech companies also face complaints from some lawmakers that they have become too large and powerful. 'First, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,' Feld said. 'In this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention. Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.\u2022 Microsoft sent a 23-page letter to the commission in July outlining the company's argument that the commission should not change its stance on net neutrality. 'Now is not the time for the commission to abandon 15 years of progress toward protecting the economic future of our country,' the letter said. 'Now is not the time for the commission to abandon its open internet rules.' The company has otherwise kept a relatively low profile on the issue. On Nov. 28, Brad Smith,[1] Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, tweeted that 'Microsoft believes in preserving the open internet ...poses weakening net-neutrality protections.' \u2022 Amazon representatives have been lobbying FCC commissioners and staff in person, with visits Nov. 29 and Dec. 6. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public-policy manager. 'During the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net-neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,' Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the FCC.'We stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,' he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission's proposed change.\u2022 Google has kept a pretty low profile in the recent net-neutrality debate. The company issued a statement last month when the proposed changes were announced, saying that the current rules were 'working well' and that it was 'disappointed' by the new proposal.But for the most part, the company has been working within the Internet Association, an industry group that includes Facebook, Amazon and other large online companies. \u2022 Apple is a newcomer to the net-neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the FCC on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.

Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site, cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \u201cDefend Net Neutrality\u201d in large letters. Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen.</p><p>But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest on Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules.</p><p>Harold Feld, a senior vice president at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicknowledge.org/\">Public Knowledge</url>, a nonprofit group that supports net neutrality, said the biggest tech companies were less vocal because they were facing more regulatory battles than in past years. Social media sites have been criticized for allowing foreign actors to interfere in the presidential election of 2016. The biggest tech companies also face complaints from some lawmakers that they have become too large and powerful.</p><p>\u201cFirst, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\u201d Mr. Feld said. \u201cIn this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.</p><p>\u201cSo with the dangers of standing up in D.C. greater, their existential concerns about net neutrality reduced because of their own massive size and a desire not to spook investors, it is unsurprising that Silicon Valley giants have melted into the background and have preferred to work through their trade associations,\u201d he said.</p><p>There also does not appear to be much chance of their winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the F.C.C., who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the landmark broadband rules created during the Obama administration.</p><p>But consumers and the start-ups that participated in protests on Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change, and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.</p><p>Here is how several of the biggest companies have handled the issue in recent months.</p><p>Google Backs Off</p><p>Google has kept a pretty low profile in the recent net neutrality debate. The company issued a statement last month when the proposed changes were announced, saying that the current rules were \u201cworking well\u201d and that it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the new proposal. But for the most part, the company has been working within <url normalizedValue=\"https://internetassociation.org/\">the Internet Association</url>, an industry group that includes Facebook, Amazon and other large online companies.</p><p>It\u2019s a restrained approach compared with Google\u2019s aggressive lobbying campaign in 2006 when Sergey Brin, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, went to Capitol Hill to argue for the importance of net neutrality. In 2010, Google teamed up with Verizon to lay out a vision for how net neutrality could work, advocating against allowing internet service providers to provide fast lanes to people who pay more. However, the proposal was criticized by advocates of an open internet because it excluded wireless connectivity and new services from broadband providers.</p><p>Apple Enters the Debate</p><p>Apple is a newcomer to the net neutrality debate. It made its first filing to the F.C.C. on the issue in August. It espoused a position largely in line with other internet giants, arguing against the creation of fast lanes and emphasizing the importance of an open internet.</p><p>Apple\u2019s public opposition to the proposed changes also reflects the growing network of services on offer from the company including Apple Music, a streaming music service that also offers video content, and potentially an internet video service to rival Netflix.</p><p>Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that all internet service providers should treat all data on the internet equally.</p><p>\u201cEqual treatment is critical to innovation in a digital economy and to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the F.C.C. doesn\u2019t provide this basic protection, we urge Congress to intervene.\u201d</p><p>Facebook Focuses Elsewhere</p><p>During the last day of online protest in support of the rules this past summer, Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s leaders, posted defiant statements to their personal Facebook pages.</p><p>But the executives have been pretty quiet on the issue in recent months. The company\u2019s focus in Washington has been more concentrated on fallout from its handling of Russian-linked propaganda used during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>This week, Facebook offered a statement from Erin Egan, a policy spokeswoman, about the F.C.C. plans:</p><p>\u201cFacebook has always supported the kind of strong net neutrality protections that will ensure the internet remains open for everyone,\u201d Ms. Egan said. \u201cWe are disappointed by the F.C.C.\u2019s decision to remove these protections, and we stand ready to work with policymakers on a framework that will protect a free and open internet.\u201d</p><p>Microsoft Keeps Low Profile</p><p>Microsoft <url normalizedValue=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1071757487895/Microsoft%20Comments%20(07-17-17).pdf\">sent a 23-page letter</url> to the commission later in July outlining the company\u2019s argument that the commission should not change its stance on net neutrality. \u201cNow is not the time for the commission to abandon 15 years of progress toward protecting the economic future of our country,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNow is not the time for the commission to abandon its open internet rules.\u201d</p><p>The company has otherwise kept a relatively low profile on the issue. On Nov. 28, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/935527891726561281\">tweeted</url> that \u201cMicrosoft believes in preserving the open internet &amp; opposes weakening net neutrality protections.\u201d</p><p>Amazon Takes Case to F.C.C.</p><p>Amazon representatives have been lobbying F.C.C. commissioners and staff in person, with visits on Nov. 29 and last Wednesday. The latter included a meeting between Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, and Darren Achord, an Amazon senior public policy manager.</p><p>\u201cDuring the meetings, we stated that Amazon has long supported net neutrality protections to ensure our customers can enjoy an open internet, and we emphasized that the company remains committed to that position,\u201d Gerard Waldron, a lawyer who represents Amazon and participated in the meeting, wrote in an account filed with the F.C.C.</p><p>\u201cWe stressed the need for enforceable, bright-line rules to protect the open internet and guard against anti-consumer and anti-competitive activities,\u201d he wrote, adding that Amazon opposed the commission\u2019s proposed change.</p><p>Netflix Turns Down the Volume</p><p>Netflix, once among the most vocal of net neutrality boosters, is perhaps the most conspicuous in its relative silence. In recent months, the company\u2019s chief executive, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/5/31/15720268/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-net-neutrality-open-internet\">Reed Hastings, has said</url> net neutrality is no longer the company\u2019s \u201cprimary battle,\u201d partly because Netflix is now large enough that it can secure the deals it needs with internet access providers to ensure its service is delivered smoothly to customers.</p><p>On Nov. 21, the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/933042368156123136?lang=en\">posted a note</url> on its primary Twitter account in support of net neutrality.</p><p>One Twitter user <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/JonGogel/status/933061383931027456\">responded</url> by saying the company should do more \u201cto tell people how it will potentially affect them.\u201d</p><p>Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Netflix, said this week that the company did not have anything to add to its earlier statements opposing the F.C.C.\u2019s actions.</p><p>PHOTO: Kickstarter\u2019s home screen on Tuesday. Many companies posted calls for action against a plan to roll back net neutrality rules.</p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-questions.html\">Net Neutrality Repeal: What Could Happen and How It Could Affect You</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html\">F.C.C.

The House of Republican has asked companies including Facebook, Google, AT&amp;T and Comcast to be present for the hearing scheduled by the House committee for September 7, 2017.</p><p>For the uninitiated, the US government's existing internet regulations do not allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block or control the flow web traffic. The laws also prevent ISPs from charging platforms such as YouTube or Netflix for early delivery of consumer content. According to Recode, attorney Chairman Ajit Pai of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) believes the current internet laws in the country are 'too heavy handed'.</p><p>In order to mend ways, Republican Greg Walden and Chairman of House Energy and Commerce Committee, has reached out to the chief executives of top technology and telecommunications companies to testify their positions at the September 7 hearing over net neutrality. According to the committee, the hearing invite has been marked to influential IT leaders such as Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts including the top executives of Amazon, Netflix, Charte, and Verizon.</p><p>Walden in his letter to the IT executives outlined that internet regulation rules formed during Barack Obama's governance have \"disrupted the longstanding regulatory balance that for years allowed the internet to grow and thrive.\" The September 7 Congress hearing will be \"an opportunity to rethink the current regulatory model and build new rules from the ground up\", Walden stated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRIND-0030615022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRIND2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P3P-R5G1-JB5M-W51X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404835</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"305\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 India.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BGR India</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 26, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>CMCSA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>CCV (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

For the uninitiated, the US government's existing internet regulations do not allow internet service providers (ISPs) to block or control the flow web traffic. The laws also prevent ISPs from charging platforms such as YouTube or Netflix for early delivery of consumer content. According to Recode, attorney Chairman Ajit Pai of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) believes the current internet laws in the country are 'too heavy handed'. In order to mend ways, Republican Greg Walden and Chairman of House Energy and Commerce Committee, has reached out to the chief executives of top technology and telecommunications companies to testify their positions at the September 7 hearing over net neutrality. According to the committee, the hearing invite has been marked to influential IT leaders such as Alphabet [2]CEO Larry Page, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, AT...EO Randall Stephenson and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts including the top executives of Amazon[3], Netflix[4], Charte, and Verizon.

It's happening right now with net neutrality - a critical issue that affects everyone who uses the internet that seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last December, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>repealed <person><nameText>President Obama's </nameText></person>net neutrality rules, setting off a firestorm of media attention and - if only briefly - focusing national attention on the need for clear rules ensuring that no internet company can block unpopular websites or unaffiliated services or otherwise discriminate online.</p><p>There was then a brief effort to revive the rules through a highly partisan longshot approach called the \"CRA\" that made some headway in the Senate but was always, as its sponsors knew too well, dead on arrival in the House of Representatives.</p><p>While well intentioned, it's no surprise this CRA tactic could not gain a foothold. It fetishized an anachronistic \"public utility\" approach to net neutrality that many regarded as gratuitous overkill for a largely unregulated internet and a buzzkill for new investment. It also oddly paid worship to administrative regulations that change with every new administration rather than a permanent Congressional law. Even if it had succeeded, the Trump FCC could have altered them again. It's kind of like that game of infinite regression.</p><p>In the meantime, the news cycle has churned on and net neutrality is like a forgotten summer romance. Many have started to believe it was all hype, drummed up by the professional consultant class to burnish their brands and raise funds, as the internet providers themselves have pledged to live by the rules even in their absence. Making sure they do now falls to the FTC as the honesty-in-advertising cop on the beat.</p><p>As much as we should celebrate consensus - and there seems to be widespread agreement on net neutrality now - legislation still seems to be the obvious coda. Legislation is a kind of \"trust but verify\" insurance policy against a future provider that may want to, say, favor its new streaming service over those of, say, Netflix or Disney. But there are other reasons too - interfering with internet traffic to increase profits is not just a salon-dinner theoretical conversation about future misbehavior by internet providers, it's a current day way-of-life for the Internet's new gilded monopolies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Those companies that collect and profile our data and decide what we can see and where we can go online pose a greater risk of censorship and manipulation of our data than anyone. Washington's big thinkers in technology have come to the party late - after months of front page stories of how these companies facilitate election interference, hate, and civic chaos and marketplace tyranny that is strip-mining our news, retail and creative industries.</p><p>Many of these leaders are now demanding that that net neutrality cover these Big Tech monopolies as well as internet providers - something only a new law from Congress can effectively ensure. It would seem obvious to anyone watching the disintegration of the internet that there is a crisis too big to corporate promises or overworked regulators. Net neutrality for all goes to the basic ability of citizens to connect and communicate, to find meaningful information, to organize and participate in the political process in a fair and open way.</p><p>On a bipartisan basis, congressional inaction conjures images of Nero fiddling while the internet burns. There is little disagreement about net neutrality widely applied and little disagreement about reining in abuses that lead to the Russia scandal, among others. It's up to party leadership on both sides to prove, contrary to growing populist sentiment in both camps, that they are not made up of decaying old politicians but rather modern problem solvers up to the task of protecting the most important communications medium of our time.</p><p>Poll after poll shows that this is what the public wants by large margins. But the permanent Washington set has been more interested in trying to leverage these poll numbers to make political hay. But that's the politics of cynicism that only fuels resentment of Washington and the spoilation of the internet.</p><p>There is a huge middle ground available here and a real opportunity for the kind of common sense problem solving Americans routinely tell pollsters what they want. It'll only happen if we drop the political jawboning and get on with the peoples' business. </p><p>Patricia Ford is a former executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0082182142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBB-J821-DY37-F311-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Sentinel Communications Co.

Many companies made their objections to the plan known online this week, but the giants of tech have largely been quiet.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Protests to preserve net neutrality, or rules that ensure equal access to the internet, migrated online Tuesday, with numerous online companies posting calls on their sites for action to stop a vote on Thursday. Reddit, Etsy and Kickstarter were among the sites warning that the proposal at the Federal Communications Commission to roll back net neutrality rules would fundamentally change the way the internet is experienced. Crowdfunding site Kickstarter cleared its entire home screen for a sparse white screen reading \"Defend Net Neutrality\" in large letters. </p><p>Reddit, the popular online message board, pushed in multiple ways on its site for keeping the rules, including a pop-up box on its home screen. But the online protests also highlighted how the biggest tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, have taken a back seat in the debate about protecting net neutrality, rules that prohibit internet service providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast from blocking or slowing sites or for charging people or companies for faster speeds of particular sites. For the most part, the large tech companies did not engage in the protest Tuesday. In the past, the companies have played a leading role in supporting the rules. Harold Feld, a senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group that supports net neutrality, said the biggest tech companies were less vocal because they were facing more regulatory battles than in past years. Social media sites have been criticized for allowing foreign actors to interfere in the presidential election of 2016. The biggest tech companies also face complaints from some lawmakers that they have become too large and powerful. \"First, the major tech companies are very aware that Washington has turned hostile,\" Feld said. \"In this environment, the big tech companies try to keep a low profile and play defense rather than take positions that draw attention.\" There also does not appear to be much chance of them winning the debate right now. The three Republican members of the FCC, who make up a majority of commissioners at the agency, have committed to roll back the broadband rules created during the Obama administration. But consumers and the startups that participated in protests Tuesday say they are gearing up for a long fight. They expect lawsuits to challenge the change and plan to push Congress to pass a law ensuring an open internet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN51773934</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5S-1281-DYRV-449M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Some nominees voluntarily highlighted changes in technology as a major challenge for the agency and lawmakers sought answers on related topics, including net neutrality, data breaches and market power in the tech sector, as expected (see 1802130046). President Donald Trump nominated antitrust lawyer Joseph Simons, whom he plans to designate chairman; former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Assistant Director Rohit Chopra; Noah Phillips, aide to Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas; and from Delta Air Lines Christine Wilson (see 1801250055 and 1801250066).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thune told the nominees he wants to \"move very quickly\" to bring them up for Senate floor confirmation, later telling reporters he hopes to slate them for consideration at Commerce's \"first available\" markup. That could come \"soon,\" pending answers to follow-up questions from committee members, Thune said. Responses are due Feb. 20.</p><p>A full Senate vote on the four nominees likely will wait until Trump puts forward another FTC Democrat so they can \"get packaged together,\" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will make the final call, a Republican aide told reporters. The four nominees would give the FTC a 3-1 Republican majority, with Chopra the Democrat. Simons would replace current Democratic Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, whose term expired but who can stay.</p><p>Consumer Protection Subcommittee ranking member Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., cautioned via a question to Simons that \"the commission should consist of five commissioners, not just\" the four nominees, \"and that it should be bipartisan.\" Blumenthal previously told us he believes a full Senate vote on the four nominees should wait until Trump names another Democrat (see 1802060039). The administration is considering Rebecca Slaughter, chief counsel to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for the slot, on Schumer's recommendation, industry lobbyists said. The White House didn't comment.</p><p>Net Neutrality</p><p>Commerce ranking member Bill Nelson, Fla., delivered the first of several rounds of Democrats' emphasis on the FTC's role on net neutrality, saying the agency \"is not the agency\" to enforce those policies even in the wake of the FCC's order to rescind its 2015 net neutrality rules. \"Despite the amazing things the FTC does, it does not have the expertise, the resources or the authority to adopt forward looking rules to protect broadband consumers,\" Nelson said. He noted his support for a planned Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval that would repeal the FCC rescission (see 1712110050 and 1712120037).</p><p>Blumenthal and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., leading work on the Senate CRA, emphasized their view that the FTC lacks rulemaking authority on net neutrality. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals 2016 in FTC v. AT&amp;T Mobility (see 1608290032) \"creates a major gap\" in the agency's net neutrality jurisdiction because of the common-carrier exemption, Blumenthal said. The 9th Circuit is reviewing en banc the three-judge panel's ruling, but until a ruling happens, the FTC \"may face an unlevel playing field where some major market participants are exempt from the commission's authority, while others are subject to it,\" Chopra said.</p><p>Simons dismissed skepticism about the FTC's net neutrality role, saying if the agency \"gets back its authority\" in the internet space, it's going to be a vigorous enforcer. \"We're going to take the statutory authority that we have and use it as best we can,\" he said, saying he hesitated without consulting agency lawyers to give a definitive answer on the extent of the FTC's current authority to go after ISPs for blocking, throttling and paid prioritization. \"It would be a great idea if we got rid of the common-carrier exemption from the FTC Act entirely,\" Simons said. Chopra and the other nominees also supported that.</p><p>Tech Concerns</p><p>The FTC should consider gaining the authority to levy civil penalties against companies after data breaches, Simons testified, worried the regulator doesn't have the capacity to incentivize companies to take proper care of consumer data. Last year's Equifax data breach was widely discussed. Chopra called it a \"wake-up call\" about the patchwork of state laws. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., a Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act (S-1816) co-sponsor, asked witnesses if guidelines should be more rigorous for companies to quickly report intrusions. Chopra said that in general several weeks doesn't sound \"fast enough.\"</p><p>All four told Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., data thefts are the most contentious and difficult consumer protection issue before the FTC. \"They are becoming much more significant, much more frequent, and I think that's a real, real concern for us,\" Simons said.</p><p>Competition in the U.S. tech sector was addressed at length. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, noted Facebook and Google have a combined market value of $1.3 trillion, more than the world's top five advertising agencies, top five media companies and top five communications companies combined. Thune said some argue big tech should be subject to more antitrust scrutiny and that the applicable law should require a more nuanced analysis, not based on size alone. Simons said \"big\" does not always mean bad. Sometimes it's good or both good and bad, he said. Often companies become big because they're successful with consumers, but \"companies that are already big and influential can sometimes use inappropriate means, anti-competitive means, to get big or stay big, and if that's the case we should be vigorously enforcing antitrust laws and attacking their conduct and prohibiting it.\"</p><p>Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Jon Tester, D-Mont., highlighted concerns about FTC Do Not Call list efficacy amid shifting robocall and telemarketing practices. \"Technology has now outpaced\" the list, Wilson said: \"We need to find a technological solution and significant enforcement\" on robocalls to address gaps. The FTC and FCC are \"having conversations and working\" on a technological solution, Simons said. \"There's no question that this needs to be a priority for us,\" Phillips said. The FTC needs to look at robocalls and other telemarketing issues \"not as an inconvenience but as a real harm to many,\" Chopra said.</p><p>Simons and the others touted their commitment to ensure the FTC continues to make decisions via a bipartisan consensus, staking out competing positions on what that consensus should be. \"By vigorously policing anti-competitive conduct, and preventing anti-competitive consolidation, the commission can help ensure that firms compete on the merits, providing better products and services to consumers at lower prices,\" Simons said. \"The free market is the most powerful and effective engine of social progress in human history,\" Phillips said. \"It works better with rules of the road and cops to enforce them.\" The agency \"must be careful to wield its power appropriately,\" Wilson said. \"The FTC must avoid trading its role as referee of our markets for one as a manager of, or a star player in, those markets.\" Chopra emphasized the need for the commission to use \"research, consumer and business education, and cooperation with other agencies\" to complement enforcement actions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RN5-21M1-JC8G-84F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002PDE</classCode><className>DELTA AIR LINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>DAL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, but it also would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The broadband industry promises the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p>That growing public movement suggests the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p>Concern about the FCC plan</p><p>FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p>The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p>That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them - and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p>\"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p>Trust your internet service provider</p><p>Broadband providers dismiss what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p>But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p>Cable and mobile providers also have been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p>There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p>Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p>Public outcry</p><p>Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p>There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p>Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge already are promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There also may be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p>But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p>Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018.</p><p>\"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Pa., wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p><p>A future FCC also could rewrite net-neutrality regulation to be tougher on the phone and cable industry. That could bring a whole new cycle of litigation by broadband companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BISTRB-8414108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BISTRB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5V-0BV1-JCM7-R33Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Bismarck Tribune, a division of Lee Enterprises All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bismarck Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 14, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The proposal would not only roll back restrictions that keep broadband providers like Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T from blocking or collecting tolls from services they don't like, it would bar states from imposing their own rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The broadband industry promises that the internet experience isn't going to change, but its companies have lobbied hard to overturn these rules. Protests have erupted online and in the streets as everyday Americans worry that cable and phone companies will be able to control what they see and do online.</p><p> That growing public movement suggests that the FCC vote won't be the end of the issue. Opponents of the move plan legal challenges, and some net-neutrality supporters hope to ride that wave of public opinion into the 2018 elections.</p><p> Concern about the FCC plan</p><p> FCC Chairman Ajit Pai says his plan eliminates unnecessary regulation that stood in the way of connecting more Americans to the internet. Under his proposal, the Comcasts and AT&amp;Ts of the world will be free to block rival apps, slow down competing service or offer faster speeds to companies who pay up. They just have to post their policies online or tell the FCC.</p><p> The change also axes consumer protections, bars state laws that contradict the FCC's approach, and largely transfers oversight of internet service to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p> After the FCC released its plan in late November, well-known telecom and media analysts Craig Moffett and Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to investors that the FCC plan dismantles \"virtually all of the important tenets of net neutrality itself.\"</p><p> That could result in phone and cable companies forcing people to pay more to do what they want online. The technology community, meanwhile, fears that additional online tolls could hurt startups who can't afford to pay them - and, over the long term, diminish innovation.</p><p> \"We're a small company. We're about 40 people. We don't have the deep pockets of Google, Netflix, Amazon to just pay off ISPs to make sure consumers can access our service,\" said Andrew McCollum, CEO of streaming-TV service Philo.</p><p> Trust your provider</p><p> Broadband providers pooh-pooh what they characterize as misinformation and irrational fears. \"I genuinely look forward to the weeks, months, years ahead when none of the fire and brimstone predictions comes to pass,\" said Jonathan Spalter, head of the trade group USTelecom, on a call with reporters Wednesday.</p><p> But some of these companies have suggested they could charge some internet services more to reach customers, saying it could allow for better delivery of new services like telemedicine. Comcast said Wednesday it has no plans for such agreements.</p><p> Cable and mobile providers have also been less scrupulous in the past. In 2007, for example, the Associated Press found Comcast was blocking or throttling some file-sharing. AT&amp;T blocked Skype and other internet calling services on the iPhone until 2009. They also aren't backing away from subtler forms of discrimination that favor their own services.</p><p> There's also a problem with the FCC's plan to leave most complaints about deceptive behavior and privacy to the FTC. A pending court case could leave the FTC without the legal authority to oversee most big broadband providers. That could leave both agencies hamstrung if broadband companies hurt their customers or competitors.</p><p> Critics like Democratic FTC commissioner Terrell McSweeny argue that the FTC won't be as effective in policing broadband companies as the FCC, which has expertise in the issue and has the ability to lay down hard-and-fast rules against certain practices.</p><p> Public outcry</p><p> Moffett and Nathanson, the analysts, said that they suspect the latest FCC rules to be short-lived. \"These changes will likely be so immensely unpopular that it would be shocking if they are allowed to stand for long,\" they wrote.</p><p> There have been hundreds of public protests against Pai's plan and more than 1 million calls to Congress through a pro-net neutrality coalition's site. Smaller tech websites such as Reddit, Kickstarter and Mozilla put dramatic overlays on their sites Tuesday in support of net neutrality. Twitter on Wednesday was promoting #NetNeutrality as a trending topic. Other big tech companies were more muted in their support.</p><p> Public-interest groups Free Press and Public Knowledge are already promising to go after Pai's rules in the courts. There may also be attempts to legislate net neutrality rules, which the telecom industry supports. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, on Tuesday called for \"bipartisan legislation\" on net neutrality that would \"enshrine protections for consumers with the backing of law.\"</p><p> But that will be tough going. Democrats criticized previous Republican attempts at legislation during the Obama administration for gutting the FCC's enforcement abilities. Republicans would likely be interested in proposing even weaker legislation now, and Democrats are unlikely to support it if so.</p><p> Some Democrats prefer litigation and want to use Republican opposition to net neutrality as a campaign issue in 2018.</p><p> \"Down the road Congress could act to put in place new rules, but with Republicans in charge of the House, Senate, and White House the likelihood of strong enforceable rules are small,\" Rep. Mike Doyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote on Reddit last week. \"Maybe after the 2018 elections, we will be in a stronger position to get that done.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Demonstrators rally Dec. 7 in support of net neutrality outside a Verizon store in New York.

He snaps a pic for social media.<br/>It's a scene from a <url normalizedValue=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/13/ajit-pai-wants-you-to-know-you-can-still-harlem-shake-after-net-neutrality-video/\">video</url>, \"Seven Things You Can Still Do on the Internet After Net Neutrality,\" shot by the conservative outlet The Daily Caller and published Wednesday, the day before the Federal Communications Commission voted to gut rules to treat internet traffic equally. Besides \"'gramming your food,\" Pai also assures The Daily Caller's readers they will still be able to take selfies, binge watch Game of Thrones, cosplay as a Jedi, and do the Harlem shake.</p><p><br/>Net-neutrality proponents have lambasted the video, and with good reason. A federal appointee charged for stewardship of public communications infrastructure comes off as insolent.<br/>Even so, there's something undeniably true about the video, which has only been amplified by reactions to the FCC's vote: The internet that net neutrality might protect is also a petri dish of the pettiness and derision Pai acts out in the video. In addition to being a public good that ought to be regulated, the internet is also an amplifier of panic, malice, and intemperance. Like it or not, those vices helped get the nation into the political moil it currently faces, from internet policy to immigration to taxation to health care-as well as to the validity of elections themselves.<br/>The most important step for the future of the internet, for citizens, politicians, and corporations alike, is to calm down, research, and debate its future. But the internet's nature might make that impossible.<br/>As had been expected, the FCC voted yesterday to roll back the Obama-era <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/13/2015-07841/protecting-and-promoting-the-open-internet\">Open Internet Order</url>, which treated broadband internet service providers-Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, and their ilk-as common carriers under Title II of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf\">Communications Act</url>. Those protections required ISPs to treat internet traffic equally, preventing them from blocking or otherwise interfering with access to specific websites, apps, or other resources. Under the new rules, dubbed \"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf\">Restoring Internet Freedom</url>\" by the FCC, ISPs would have to disclose any steps they take to limit or sell special access.<br/>The FCC voted in favor of repeal despite       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.publicconsultation.org/united-states/overwhelming-bipartisan-majority-opposes-repealing-net-neutrality/\">widespread support</url> of net neutrality among the American public-and despite the fact that public comment for the new policy appears to have been       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/24/fcc-net-neutrality-process-corrupted-by-fake-comments-and-vanishing-consumer-complaints-officials-say/\">compromised</url> by millions of fraudulent entries.<br/>Those factors will likely come up in legal challenges to the repeal, which are already mounting. The new rules won't take effect for at least several months. State attorneys general have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1157178/us-state-attorneys-general-are-already-suing-to-save-net-neutrality-from-the-fcc/\">begun</url> filing lawsuits. And Congress could adopt legislation that would codify net neutrality into law, a move that activists are encouraging citizens to appeal for. The Democratic senator Ed Markey       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/941378914185895936\">announced</url> plans for legislation to reverse the FCC's repeal, and given the bipartisan support for net neutrality among the electorate, it's possible that such a bill could find support across the aisle.<br/>Possible, but hardly guaranteed. A       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/121317-FCC-Net-Neutrality.pdf\">letter</url> to the FCC from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce supporting the FCC's action was signed by 107 Republican members of Congress. Of those, Motherboard       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xwknx/republican-members-of-congress-fcc-letter\">reported</url> that 84 have taken telco-industry contributions.<br/>Even though the FCC's action-a 3-2 vote along party lines-has been anticipated since the proposal's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pai-proposes-restore-internet-freedom\">announcement</url> just before Thanksgiving, public response to yesterday's rollback was severe. On Twitter, a woman       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/brynnetucker/status/941383184419311617\">posted</url> a video of her 11-year-old sister's school lunch table shouting \"Ajit Pai is a loser.\" A Missouri man created a $500,000 crowd-funding campaign (since taken down) to \"deport Ajit Pai\"-a dense morsel of consumer rights mixed with xenophobia (Pai is Indian American) that typifies the ethos of the internet.<br/>The media's response has been similarly drastic. Jimmy Kimmel       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/jimmy-kimmel-blasts-jackhole-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-for-repealing-net-neutrality\">weighed in</url>, calling Pai a \"jackhole\" who wants to line the pockets of big telco at the cost of the public. Briefly, CNN       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/media/364959-cnn-headline-declares-end-of-the-internet-as-we-know-it-after-net-neutrality\">ran</url> the headline, \"End of the Internet as We Know It.\"<br/>One such fear, widely held by net-neutrality proponents, is that ISPs might slice up internet service into tiers, as they have done for cable television. Stoking this fear, @therealbanksy, the Twitter account that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://junkee.com/the-five-worst-fake-twitter-accounts/51967\">ostensibly</url> represents the anonymous British artist Banksy,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/thereaIbanksy/status/940989790677291010\">posted</url> a warning: \"If you don't want to pay extra for your favorite sites you need to be supporting       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetNeutrality?src=hash\">#NetNeutrality</url>.\" Along with it, some hypothetical fees: Twitter: $14.99/month; Netflix: $9.99/movie; Google: $1.99/search. As I write this, it has been retweeted 162,000 times. @therealbanksy, whose profile reads \"fan account,\" aptly represents the internet itself: billions of people, who might also be dogs, criminals, children, or senators, all jockeying for a shred of one another's attention at all costs.<br/>Even the FCC hearing itself was disrupted by the internet's feral anxiety about itself. While details are still uncertain, the meeting was briefly interrupted due to a security threat. After bomb-sniffing dogs cleared the area, the vote resumed. \"The left's outcry at Mr. Pai 'killing' internet freedom,\" the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote in response, \"has been so overwrought that the FCC meeting room had to be cleared Thursday for a security threat.\"<br/>Pai's Daily Caller video inspired similar indignation. The video appears to feature a cameo by an apologist for Pizzagate, the false conspiracy theory about a Democratic child sex trafficking ring run from a Washington, D.C. pizza joint. The net-neutrality opposition has latched onto this connection, using Pai's association with the publication as an indictment of his position on common carriage.<br/>The internet has amplified excess, making any one extreme act or idea require an even more extreme response. An arms race for profligacy.<br/>In truth, nobody yet knows how the net-neutrality rollback will affect anyone-consumers, telcos, big tech, or start-ups. Internet zealots warn of widespread blocking and throttling, not to mention pay-for-play fast lanes that might benefit big companies like Netflix and Google and prevent upstarts from enjoying innovation and growth. ISPs, aware of how hot the issue is, will likely take no immediate action.<br/>When they do, it will probably come in a form invisible to consumers anyway. Pay-for-play deals with big providers might make some services load faster and others slower. Small delays can be fatal for adoption and continued use, and the costs of operating a new business in such an environment might make some start-ups inviable.<br/>As       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/network-neutrality-cant-fix-the-internet/546620/?utm_source=feed\">I've argued before</url>, progressive advocacy for net neutrality can't credibly claim to be acting on behalf of consumers and small businesses when venture-backed technology start-ups are the main beneficiary. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality\">dissenting statements</url> of both Democratic FCC commissioners, Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, give special mention to the \"innovators\" who might be harmed by dismantling net neutrality: big tech companies that might have to pay tariffs to telcos, or small tech companies that might struggle to do so. Bandwidth-heavy services would be most impacted-the \"next Netflix,\" as advocates often name it-but it's not clear that the online-video market hasn't been taken over by incumbents anyway, like search and social networking have.<br/>Pai has justified the rollback on the grounds that the existing guidance overregulated the telecommunications sector, which operated without formal net-neutrality rules until the Open Internet Order was adopted in 2015. Since then, Pai insists, telco investment in broadband infrastructure has declined. Spurring more and better access, the FCC has decided, is more important than regulating broadband as common carriage.<br/>The 2015 adoption of the Open Internet Order offered leverage to big tech companies like Google (now Alphabet), who might have pressed further into the broadband-service space. After all, some 50 million U.S. homes       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/50-million-us-homes-have-only-one-25mbps-internet-provider-or-none-at-all/\">have only one choice</url> for broadband service, driving service costs up. But instead, in 2016, Alphabet       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/technology/google-curbs-expansion-of-fiber-optic-network-cutting-jobs.html\">curbed expansion</url> of its residential fiber network, which it began building in 2010. Rolling out fiber is expensive, complicated, and breeds dissatisfaction. Unlike search or docs, services that run in the cloud, fiber has to be installed and maintained in the physical world. In Atlanta, where I live, Google fiber installation       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/google-fiber-contractor-connected-to-several-line-breaks/296434858\">caused</url> numerous gas-line breaks, along with less-easily trackable disputes with property owners over digging and repair.<br/>Even once installed, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-to-google-fiber-1792440779\">switching cost</url> of moving from a provider like Comcast to Google is high; people hate waiting for service technicians. It's just more profitable to sell digital ads against searches and videos that other people make. Google's net profits in Q3 2017 alone       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/alphabet-q3-2017-earnings-1202600236/\">totaled</url> $6.7 billion.<br/>This situation in mind, it's at least possible that terror over the apparent end of net neutrality might spur broadband investment and competition, especially if providers commit to equal treatment. It's also possible that small-scale, start-up innovation in broadband access is impossible in America absent a threat to the internet. In the wake of the FCC's vote, Vice       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5djd7/motherboard-and-vice-are-building-a-community-internet-network-to-protect-net-neutrality\">announced plans</url> to create a fiber-backed mesh network for the Brooklyn neighborhood where its offices are located. Such experiments are not new, but it's unusual for a media company to ponder entering the ISP business. Nothing was stopping Vice from taking such a step before net neutrality reached the precipice-except, perhaps, a credible business justification for doing so, even if just as a branding exercise.<br/>Other, better solutions to broadband competition exist. One is local-loop unbundling, a policy that requires telcos to share last-mile connections with competitors. It's one of the reasons that broadband is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2014/02/21/you-wont-have-broadband-competition-without-regulation/\">so much cheaper</url> in Europe than it is in the United States. The 1996       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996\">Telecommunication Act</url> included an unbundling provision, requiring providers to offer access to their networks at \"reasonable\" cost when \"technically feasible.\" The policy spurred competition in DSL, but fiber was too hypothetical at the time, and it wasn't covered in the act. Even so, small competitors had trouble getting central access for service provisioning once they had last-mile access. The big telcos had no trouble finding ways to argue against technical feasibility.<br/>The problem with regulatory apparatuses like local-loop unbundling is that they are boring. Nobody wants to think about the complicated, messy infrastructure that actually makes it possible for irascible tweets to make it from the phones in people's hands to the servers on which they are stored. It's much simpler and more comforting to imagine the internet as the \"cloud\" of its marketers-an ethereal force that surrounds you and me and everyone. One that, like air or water, sates a basic need of human life.<br/>In her dissent-a \"eulogy,\" she even calls it-Rosenworcel, the FCC commissioner, writes, \"the future of the internet is the future of everything. That is because there is nothing in our commercial, social, and civic lives that has been untouched by its influence or unmoved by its power.\"<br/><br/>This sentiment is both true and terrifying. The idea that a global data network would have so much power and influence should give everyone pause. Not only because it implies that so much of public and private life is conducted by means of that infrastructure. But also because it inspires people-and businesses, and government agencies, and elected officials themselves-to press toward the worst extremes of their character. It's undeniable that modern society relies on the internet. Less often discussed are the impacts of such a dependence. Until they reach a breaking point, like the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/?utm_source=feed\">compromise of democracy</url> or the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-marks-the-end-of-shame-over-data-security/539202/?utm_source=feed\">mass exposure of personal information</url>.<br/>\"Internet access became the dial tone of the digital age,\" Rosenworcel's dissent continues. She understates matters. Instead, it has become this era's heartbeat. Data has become the blood that courses through the veins of ordinary life. This is why everyone in the debate is so passionate. But it's also worth remembering that this is just a metaphor. The world is still out there, underneath and above all the fiber-optic lines that would take it online.<br/>When it comes to net neutrality, supporting or opposing it is no longer sufficient. Killing net neutrality probably won't make things better, but keeping it without any other substantive changes will ensure things get worse-instead of civics, only mania will remain. The internet is as much the enemy as it is the hero of contemporary life. It is not the free and open internet that must be eulogized, but the public's blindness to its consequences.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-netneutralitywasneverenough548549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R6F-0GX1-JCG7-V51P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

A simple thing that the liberal media would likely treat as an administration rocking scandal if it involved the Trump campaign.According to a Bloomberg report[2] out early Monday morning, Buttigieg campaign manager Chris Meagher confirmed: 'Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg's campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring' Adding: 'Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg's wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.'The report also showed that Buttigieg was friends with Zuckerberg's roommates while they were both at Harvard University. </p><p>That's not to mention Buttigieg's favorable attitude towards Silicon Valley and their support for him: Buttigieg, meanwhile, has become somewhat of a darling of Silicon Valley Democrats, repeatedly returning to San Francisco for high-dollar fundraisers. He's been more apprehensive about breaking up big tech companies than some of his Democratic counterparts, saying the issue of monopolies extends beyond tech. But he's also raised concerns about tech companies having too much power and has floated regulation, including fines and the blocking of new mergers, for Facebook and other big tech companies. But it wasn't as if the networks completely ignored Facebook on Monday. During both their morning and evening newscasts, NBC News shared the exclusive interview NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt conducted with Zuckerberg.As NewsBusters senior news analyst Kyle Drennen reported, Holt's largest concern[3] was that Facebook was going to allow Trump to use the social media platform to 'lie, lie, lie': The move to call out foreign actors comes as Facebook is embroiled in controversy over political ads at home, criticized for refusing to pull a Donald Trump ad that contained false claims about Joe Biden. Zuckerberg saying it's not their role to fact-check candidate claims. 'Do you feel like you're giving a green light to politicians that lie, lie, lie,' Holt added.Clearly, the liberal media currently view the world through Trump-focused lenses that filter out most of the serious, questionable, and accountability demanding actions of politicians that don't involve the President. If it was the Trump campaign, they would probably try to raise campaign finance questions and see if it could be considered an impeachable offense, orperhaps try to smear Facebook as Trump supporters since the mediatakes offense to that.

A simple thing that the liberal media would likely treat as an administration rocking scandal if it involved the Trump campaign.According to a Bloomberg report[2] out early Monday morning, Buttigieg campaign manager Chris Meagher confirmed: 'Zuckerberg sent multiple emails to Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg's campaign manager, with names of individuals that he might consider hiring' Adding: 'Priscilla Chan, Zuckerberg's wife, also sent multiple emails to Schmuhl with staff recommendations. Ultimately, two of the people recommended were hired.'The report also showed that Buttigieg was friends with Zuckerberg's roommates while they were both at Harvard University. </p><p>That's not to mention Buttigieg's favorable attitude towards Silicon Valley and their support for him: Buttigieg, meanwhile, has become somewhat of a darling of Silicon Valley Democrats, repeatedly returning to San Francisco for high-dollar fundraisers. He's been more apprehensive about breaking up big tech companies than some of his Democratic counterparts, saying the issue of monopolies extends beyond tech. But he's also raised concerns about tech companies having too much power and has floated regulation, including fines and the blocking of new mergers, for Facebook and other big tech companies. But it wasn't as if the networks completely ignored Facebook on Monday. During both their morning and evening newscasts, NBC News shared the exclusive interview NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt conducted with Zuckerberg.As NewsBusters senior news analyst Kyle Drennen reported, Holt's largest concern[3] was that Facebook was going to allow Trump to use the social media platform to 'lie, lie, lie': The move to call out foreign actors comes as Facebook is embroiled in controversy over political ads at home, criticized for refusing to pull a Donald Trump ad that contained false claims about Joe Biden. Zuckerberg saying it's not their role to fact-check candidate claims. 'Do you feel like you're giving a green light to politicians that lie, lie, lie,' Holt added.Clearly, the liberal media currently view the world through Trump-focused lenses that filter out most of the serious, questionable, and accountability demanding actions of politicians that don't involve the President. If it was the Trump campaign, they would probably try to raise campaign finance questions and see if it could be considered an impeachable offense, orperhaps try to smear Facebook as Trump supporters since the mediatakes offense to that.

Their teacher is hours away, in a small office at Chhindwara, three hours from Nagpur, the nearest big city.<br/>The distance notwithstanding, the students get their lessons in science and English on a virtual board, thanks to the Internet. Good tuition centres and qualified teachers are hard to come by in these parts, and the virtual solution is a blessing for those who do not have to travel long hours to the nearest town.<br/>For the $40-billion networking giant Cisco, this represents the future of its business in India. The firm, which earns most of its revenue from selling equipment that directs Internet traffic, is now staking its future beyond big cities. After finding a firm footing in India, the San Jose, Californiaheadquartered company is thinking long term. Despite poor physical infrastructure and a rudimentary Internet backbone, Cisco thinks it can perhaps seed its next billion dollars or more from places deep in the interiors of India.<br/> The gameplan...<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Turn to India's hinterland for the next $1-bn revenue</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Custom-made solutions for the rural market</p><p>Line up new partners to tap the opportunity</p><p>Provide funding and mentorship to fi rms building Internet-based businesses in the hinterland</p><p>New business unit to focus on long-term opportunities</p><p>But...<br/></p><p>The plan is dependent on a rapid growth of broadband, where actual numbers have always lagged bold predictions</p><p>The hinterland is a costconscious market.

Cisco is walking the talk: from teaching maths in Chhindwara to helping kids with English in Karnataka hamlets. Villagers in Gubbi, in Karnataka's Tumkur district, have seen \"a 20-km journey for a caste certificate reduced to a two-minute walk\", adds Venkataraman.<br/>Cisco had an early start in India, having set up a sales office in 1995. Its revenues here crossed $1 billion (Rs 4,600 crore) last year after growing 40 to 50 per cent per annum over the past five years. As part of its focus on emerging markets, Cisco in 2007 chose India as the first place to set up Industry Business Councils, or units focused on pursuing long-term business opportunities. The same year it relocated Globalisation Chief Wim Elfrink - the No. 2 man after Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Chambers - to Bangalore.<br/>Not satisfied with its breakneck growth in India - its revenue has grown six times in 10 years - the Internet equipment giant is thinking ahead. Though Cisco boasts of big customers here such as the Tatas, State Bank of India and Reliance Industries, besides a majority market share in routers and switches, it now believes the hinterland could be its next big opportunity.<br/>\"We are very bullish on health care and education,\" says Cisco India chief Naresh Wadhwa. \"We believe there could be multi-billion dollar opportunity from such business initiatives globally in the next few years.\"<br/>The company is looking beyond its conventional partners (big tech systems integrators such as Infosys Technologies) to discover fresh opportunities. For example, it has tied up with truck maker Ashok Leyland to build local transport solutions, Everonn for distance learning initiatives, and solar power solutions developer Neurosynaptic to offer power back-up to some distant hamlets.<br/>In the process, Cisco is trying to connect villages using a combination of its own and partner technologies. In Chhindwara, for instance, the company is mentoring and funding three 20-somethings who think they can use the Internet to improve the reach of education in the smallest of villages.<br/>In May 2008, Anurag Pawar, a resident of this town with a population of 120,000, met Elfrink and impressed the Dutchman. Pawar's company, Lakshya Networks, wants to provide distance learning education to surrounding villages. Lakshya has covered seven villages, teaching 770 students so far. Pawar thinks he has a winning idea because of the overcrowded tuition centres and the low pass percentage in the region. Cisco has seed-funded Lakshya and even flown mentors from Bangalore to help it scale up. Lakshya's expansion plans - 25 centres and about 3,000 students next year - are music to Cisco's ears as the start-up runs on its products and services.<br/>Similarly, in Raichur in north Karnataka, Cisco is providing distance learning services in five villages with its education partner Everonn. The project is even more ambitious than the Lakshya model, because it gets these lessons from tutors in Chennai, some 500 km away.<br/>Education is one of the biggest opportunities in India. The kindergarten to Class 12 segment already accounts for as much as 40 per cent of an overall $65-billion education industry in India and the National Council for Education Research Training believes that 25,000 new schools are required to keep pace with the booming demand.<br/>A few kilometres away from Raichur, a fort town bordering Andhra Pradesh, Cisco is helping rebuild houses damaged in last year's floods. As part of the project, in nearby Gillesugur, it is also building a prototype of a telemedicine project that it hopes can be a model for the rest. Until the pilot project became operational earlier this year, locals had to travel long distances, often as far as Hyderabad or Bangalore for medical tests. Cisco is trying to reinvent technology for this market, devising a laptop version of its costly HealthPresence set-up, which allows doctors to remotely examine patients on their notebook computers using dial-up or wireless Net connections.<br/>A technician rigs up an electronic device the size of a bread box to help a doctor monitor basic health parameters such as heart beat, pulse and body temperature. Telemedicine is not a new concept.<br/>Competition calling&lt;br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;&lt;br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;Used to lording over the market for Internet gear, Cisco has found the pitch increasingly crowded in the last couple of years as its global rivals home in on the potential in India. China's Huawei, which has been consistently dogged by data security concerns, sought to make a statement when it announced a $2-billion investment in its India operations, covering R&amp;D, sales and marketing. Smaller startups such as Juniper, too, are growing, by as much as 20 per cent per annum, according to India Managing Director Ravi Chauhan. Others such as HP (with its 3Com buy) is likely to make a bigger impact in communication technology, a segment Cisco has been edging into. \"We are ahead of the competition and the market,\" claims Naresh Wadhwa, Cisco India chief. \"When we moved to complete solutions, our rivals began selling boxes.\" He points to the state-run Accelerated Power Reforms Development Programme, where it bagged 11 of the 13 deals for smart metering solutions. While Cisco may own nearly three quarters of the market for Internet gear such as routers and switches, its dominance is not so pronounced in wireless local area networks and enterprise telephony, where it holds less than a quarter. This may just be the opportunity Huawei is eyeing. With mobile 3G services being rolled out, the Chinese equipment maker feels it is at the right place at the right time. \"Huawei supplies 3G equipment to major telecom operators here,\" Max Yang, MD, Huawei India, recently told BT.<br/>Companies such as Apollo Hospitals have large units in the country and overseas administering medicine remotely. Yet, dozens of projects have failed to take off. If Cisco can prove its model with the Raichur project, the market before it is India's 600,000 villages.<br/>Cisco's most ambitious bet, however, is perhaps on the struggling state-run citizen services centres, or CSCs, which provide technologybased services such as electronic certificates for land, employment, income and caste, payment of utility services and access to high-speed communication for initiatives such as telemedicine in Karnataka, and potentially across the country. The firm, as part of a nine-company consortium along with the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore, or IIM-B, is trying to rewire these centres to make them more efficient and financially viable. CSCs have been beset by poor Internet connectivity, a narrow range of services and a lukewarm response from state administrations, getting reduced to mobile recharge shops and even petty stores.<br/>Up to 60 per cent of the CSCs are unviable, a recent IIM-B study found. Cisco and its partners want to rewire these centres to provide a range of services. \"Rather than just inputs such as agricultural prices, they could provide data on where to sell products, market forecast and weather conditions,\" says Gopal Naik, a professor at IIM-B. Cisco is starting small on the retooling, working on just four CSCs in Gubbi. \"The eventual plan is to have a model for 250,000 centres to be established nationwide,\" he says.<br/>Unlike its large enterprise business, Cisco's rural India drive is expected to leverage custom solutions, which are both cheaper and easier to install. Cisco says there are plenty of businesses to be tapped here and points to the potential overhaul of CSCs as just one example. \"We require hinterland and can implement our projects,\" says Wadhwa. Despite a raft of new projects, there is plenty of hard work ahead and challenges to overcome. The competition is intensifying, for one (see Competition Calling). In July 2010, Huawei launched a WiMAX (wireless over long distance) project in Rajasthan to provide broadband access to public service centres and village panchayats. Still, what Cisco has going for it is a high degree of familiarity with its products among local support engineers, says Richard Kramer, an analyst with Arete Research, a New York-based equity research firm. \"It needs to learn from native emerging market companies like Huawei and Indian firms like Micromax or HCL, and figure out what makes them profitable at lower price points.\"<br/>Some may say that is a tough task but Cisco executives remain upbeat and believe their discovery of Bharat has just begun. A journey that they hope will pay back handsomely when it takes these solutions and products to poor and middle-income markets elsewhere in the world.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LIVMIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTOD2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:52BD-5YH1-DYX3-518C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163808</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1797\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Living Media India Ltd.

But an immediate problem arises. At least under modern US law, being a monopoly (or a near-monopoly) is not illegal. Nor is making high profits illegal, especially when it is accomplished by providing services that are free to consumers and making money through advertising. </p><p>Antitrust kicks in when anticompetitive behavior is involved: that is, a situation in which a firm takes actions which have the effect of blocking actual or potential competitors./For example, the antitrust case against Microsoft [1]that was settled back in 2001 wasn't that the firm was big or successful, bur rather that the firm was engaged in an anticompetitive practice of \"tying\" together separate products, and in this way trying to use its near-monopoly position in the operating systems that run personal computers to gain a similar monopoly position for its internet browser--and in this way to drive off potential competitors. .In the case of big tech companies, a common theory is that they hold a monopoly position because of what economists call \"network effects.\"The economic theory of network effects started with the observation that certain products are only valuable if other people also own the same product--think of a telephone or fax machine. Moreover, the product becomes more valuable as the network gets bigger. When \"platform\" companies like Amazon or Facebook came along, network effects got a new twist. The idea became that if a website managed to gain a leadership position in attracting buyers and sellers (like Amazon, OpenTable, or Uber), or users and providers of content (like Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter), then others would be attracted to the website as well. Any potentially competing website might have a hard time building up its own critical mass of users, in which case network effects are acting as an anticompetitive barrier.Of course, the idea that an already-popular meeting place has an advantage isn't limited to the virtual world: many shopping malls and downtown areas rely on a version of network effects, too, as to stock markets, flea markets, and bazaars.But while it's easy to sketch in the air an argument about network effects, the question of how network effects work in reality isn't a simple one. David S. Evans and Richard Schmalensee offer a short essay on \"Debunking the `Network Effects' Bogeyman: Policymakers need to march to the evidence, not to slogans,\" inRegulation <url normalizedValue=\"https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2017/12/regulation-v40n4-1.pdfmagazine\">https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2017/12/regulation-v40n4-1.pdfmagazine</url> Winter 2017-18, pp. 36-39). As they point out, lots of companies that might at the time seemed to have an advantage of \"network effects\" have faltered: for example, eBay looked like the network Goliath back in 2001, but it was soon overtaken by Amazon. They write: \"The flaw in that reasoning is that people can use multiple online communications platforms, what economists call `multihoming.' A few people in a social network try a new platform. If enough do so and like it, then eventually all network memberscould use it and even drop their initial platform. This process hashappened repeatedly. AOL, MSN Messenger, Friendster, MySpace, and Orkut all rose to great heights and then rapidly declined,while Facebook, Snap, WhatsApp, Line, and others quickly rose. ...\"Systematic research on online platforms by several authors, including one of us, shows considerable churn inleadership for online platforms over periods shorter than a decade. Then there is the collection of dead or withered platforms thatdot this sector, including Blackberry and Windows in smartphoneoperating systems, AOL in messaging, Orkut in social networking, and Yahoo in mass online media ...\"The winner-take-all slogan also ignores the fact that many online platforms make their money from advertising. As manyof the firms that died in the dot-com crash learned, winning the opportunity to provide services for free doesn't pay the bills. Whenit comes to micro-blogging, Twitter has apparently won it all. Butit is still losing money because it hasn't been very successful at attracting advertisers, which are its main source of income. Ignoringthe advertising side of these platforms is a mistake. Googleis still the leading platform for conducting searches for free, but when it comes to product searches\u2014which is where Googlemakes all its money\u2014it faces serious competition from Amazon.Consumers are roughly as likely to start product searches on Amazon.com, the leading e-commerce firm, as on Google, theleading search-engine firm.\"It should also be noted that if network effects are large and block new competition, they pose a problem for antitrust enforcement, too. Imagine that Amazon or Facebook was required by law to split into multiple pieces, with the idea that the pieces would compete with each other. But if network effects really are large, then one or another of the pieces will grow to critical mass and crowd out the others--until the status quo re-emerges.A related argument is that big tech firms have access to Big Data from many players in a given market, which gives them an advantage. Evans and Schmalensee are skeptical of this point, too. They write: \"Like the simple theory of network effects, the 'big data is bad' theory, which is often asserted in competition policy circles as well as the media, is falsified by not one, but many counterexamples. AOL, Friendster, MySpace, Orkut, Yahoo, and many other attention platforms had data on their many users. So did Blackberry and Microsoft in mobile. As did numerous search engines, including AltaVista, Infoseek, and Lycos. Microsoft did in browsers. Yet in these and other categories, data didn't give the incumbents the power to prevent competition. Nor is there any evidence that their data increased the network effects for these firms in any way that gave them a substantial advantage over challengers.\"In fact, firms that at their inception had no data whatsoever sometimes displaced the leaders. When Facebook launched its social network in India in 2006 in competition with Orkut, it had no data on Indian users since it didn't have any Indian users. That same year Orkut was the most popular social network in India, with millions of users and detailed data on them. Four years later, Facebook was the leading social network in India. Spotify provides a similar counterexample. When Spotify entered the United States in 2011, Apple had more than 50 million iTunes users and was selling downloaded music at a rate of one billion songs every four months. It had data on all those people and what they downloaded. Spotify had no users and no data when it started. Yet it has been able to grow to become the leading source of digital music in the world. In all these and many other cases the entrants provided a compelling product, got users, obtained data on those users, and grew.\"The point isn't that big data couldn't provide a barrier to entry or even grease network effects. As far as we know, there is no way to rule that out entirely. But at this point there is no empirical support that this is anything more than a possibility, which one might explore in particular cases.\"Evans and Schmalensee are careful to note that they are not suggesting that online platform companies should be exempt from antitrust scrutiny, and perhaps in some cases the network and data arguments might carry weight. As they write: \"Nothing we've said here is intended to endorse a 'go-easy' policy toward online platforms when it comes to antitrust enforcement. ... There's no particular reason to believe these firms are going to behave like angels. Whether they benefit from network effects or not, competition authorities ought to scrutinize dominant firms when it looks like they are breaking the rules and harming consumers. As always, the authorities should use evidence-based analysis grounded in sound economics. The new economics of multisided platforms provides insights into strategies these firms may engage in as well as cautioning against the rote application of antitrust analysis designed for single-sided firms to multisided ones. \"It is time to retire the simple network effects theory\u2014which is older than the fax machine\u2014in place of deeper theories, with empirical support, of platform competition. And it is not too soon to ask for supporting evidence before accepting any version of the 'big data is bad' theory. Competition policy should march to the evidence, not to the slogans.\"For an introduction to the economics of multi-sided \"platform\" markets, a useful starting point is Marc Rysman's \"The Economics of Two-Sided Markets\" in the Summer 2009 issue of the Journal of Economic Perspectives[2] (23:3, 125-43). For an economic analysis of policy, the underlying reasons matter a lot, because they set a precedent that will affect future actions by regulators and firms. Thus, it's not enough to rave against the size of Big Tech. It's necessary to get specific: for example, about how public policy should view network effects or online buyer-and-seller platforms, and about the collection, use, sharing, and privacy protections for data. We certainly don't want the current big tech companies to stifle new competition or abuse consumers. But in pushing back against the existing firms, we don't want regulators to set rules that could close off new competitors, either.

The plan will likely pass along party lines at the next FCC meeting December 14.<br/>It makes sense to construe broadband and wireless providers as common carriers, like telephone companies and utilities. And a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/21/poll-shows-broad-bipartisan-support-net-neutrality-rules/\">majority</url> of Americans, no matter their affiliation, support regulating internet providers in this manner. But advocates must also acknowledge that the internet is hardly a healthy environment for competition, consumer protection, and equity of use even with net-neutrality guidelines in place.<br/>There's reason to believe that internet providers will abuse their power absent net-neutrality oversight: They have a history of doing so.<br/>In 2007, Comcast throttled traffic to BitTorrent, a popular peer-to-peer service used (both legally and illegally) to distribute entertainment content in competition with Comcast's cable business. The FCC       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/fcc-formally-rules-comcasts-throttling-of-bittorrent-was-illegal/\">ruled</url> the practice illegal in 2008, but its complaint against Comcast was ultimately dismissed due to a lack of regulatory authority to intervene in such cases. In 2012, AT&amp;amp;T       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/atandt-faces-complaint-over-iphone-facetime-blocking/2012/09/18/799c8650-0183-11e2-b257-e1c2b3548a4a_blog.html?tid=a_inl\">blocked</url> FaceTime, Apple's video-chat service, because it competed with AT&amp;amp;T's telephony offerings. The company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/atandt-lifts-facetime-restrictions-on-apple-iphones/2012/11/08/cbec36de-29de-11e2-b4e0-346287b7e56c_blog.html\">reversed course</url> after the threat of an FCC complaint on net-neutrality grounds. In 2014, Netflix       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/256586/the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to-pay-comcast-for-internet-traffic/\">filed</url> an extensive opposition to the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, revealing that it had paid for direct access to Comcast broadband customers in consideration for delivery of its bandwidth-intensive streaming service. And in 2016, the FCC       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/02/fcc-accuses-atandt-and-verizon-of-violating-net-neutrality/\">flagged</url> AT&amp;amp;T for excluding DirecTV-a unit AT&amp;amp;T owns-from its customers' data allocation.<br/>To prevent such blocking, throttling, and pay for play in internet content delivery, the FCC published the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1.pdf\">Open Internet Report and Order</url> in 2015, declaring internet service providers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_carrier\">common carriers</url> under Title II of the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf\">Communications Act</url>. It is these protections that Ajit Pai-who previously worked for Verizon, a company that could benefit from the change-hopes to withdraw.<br/>Co-opting language common to net-neutrality proponents, Pai claims that reversing net neutrality will \"restore internet freedom.\" Republican commissioner Brendan Carr       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fcc.gov/document/statement-commissioner-carr-restoring-internet-freedom\">adds</url> that the plan will remedy \"the Obama-era FCC's regulatory overreach.\" But Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/rosenworcel-statement-fcc-plan-roll-back-internet-rights\">called</url> the plan \"ridiculous and offensive.\"<br/>If the commission gives the new rules a nod next month, consumer groups will likely challenge them in court. But if the policy takes effect, broadband and wireless providers could resume blocking or throttling content, and they could establish \"fast lanes\" for content providers who pay fees for special access to online consumers. In theory, internet providers could also slice up internet service into paid tiers, charging consumers more for popular services. Even so, under the FCC's proposed rules, the carriers must disclose any restrictions or preferential payments.<br/>Net-neutrality proponents often call the regulated internet \"free and open,\" ideals that trace back to the libertarian origins of personal computing and cyberculture. Under this precept, computing and the internet are meant for everyone, and anyone should be able to use them to take a swing at personal or professional success. It's because of this supposed freedom and openness that successful companies like Google and Facebook were viable in the first place-access to customers absent gatekeepers. Indeed, net-neutrality proponents often       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fcc-prepares-to-unveil-plan-to-gut-net-neutrality/\">cite</url> start-ups as a first or primary justification for the policy. Netflix can afford to pay off Comcast at any price. But what about \"the next Netflix?\"<br/>This story made some sense in 2005, when the FCC       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf\">first offered</url> positive policy guidance on net neutrality. The dot-com crash was a recent memory, Google had just gone public, and News Corp had just acquired the big social-network company of the time-Myspace. It made some sense in 2008, too, when the FCC pursued Comcast over BitTorrent, and in 2012 when AT&amp;amp;T blocked FaceTime. It even made some sense in 2015, when common carriage for ISPs was formally established. Net neutrality's popularity has always relied on the public's satisfaction with life online, and the business practices that facilitated it. Otherwise, there would be no reason to protect it from supposed destruction.<br/>Until recently, that satisfaction was almost universal. Companies like Google and Facebook enjoyed widespread public trust and support. They often appeared to share the same \"free and open\" values that net-neutrality proponents celebrate. By contrast, everyone loves to hate telcos like AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon, old-economy oligopolies with terrible customer service that charge high prices for mediocre services.<br/>But that's changed over the last year, as security breaches, privacy violations, election meddling, wealth inequality, and a host of other concerns have sullied the tech sector's reputation. The examples are so numerous it's impossible to list them anymore. Here's an ironic example: Hundreds of thousands of stolen and fraudulent identities       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@AGSchneiderman/an-open-letter-to-the-fcc-b867a763850a\">reportedly corrupted</url> the FCC's own net-neutrality comment process. Or consider two cases that came to light just yesterday, the same day Pai announced the FCC's plans to gut net neutrality: Android devices       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1131515/google-collects-android-users-locations-even-when-location-services-are-disabled/\">apparently</url> have been sending their users' locations back to Google, even with location services disabled; and Uber       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data\">reportedly</url> paid hackers $100,000 to cover up a personal-data breach of 57 million of its customers. A public darling during the Obama years, when net neutrality won out, the tech industry has effectively become Big Tech, an aggressor industry along the lines of pharmaceuticals, oil, or tobacco.<br/>It's true that one set of giant internet companies, like Comcast and Verizon, can't currently mess with what people read, watch, and explore online. But another faction of giant internet companies can and do exert that power and control. Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and others manage access to most of the content created and delivered via broadband and wireless networks. Google appears to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/267161/market-share-of-search-engines-in-the-united-states/\">handle</url> over 63 percent of searches, and it is       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth\">projected</url> to control 80 percent of the search ad market by 2019. Facebook       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/when-the-facebook-traffic-goes-away/543828/?utm_source=feed\">exerts</url> enormous control over access to news online, and its unmanaged ad network appears to have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/what-facebook-did/542502/?utm_source=feed\">torn democracy asunder</url>.<br/>Net-neutrality telecommunications policy might benefit the public by providing impartial access to online services. But even so, Big Tech's stranglehold on those services puts the lie to the underlying freedom and openness those services ultimately offer. When it comes to ISPs, a more effective solution would involve       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local-loop_unbundling\">local-loop unbundling</url>-requiring telcos to lease last-mile connections to competitors. Even if that worked and a thousand broadband providers bloomed, the internet would still operate in fundamentally the same way. All the internet Davids might not have to pay for placement with the telco giants, but they must do so to the tech Goliaths.<br/>Local retailers have to manage their searchability on Google, or pay for ads to compete with big companies like Amazon. Restaurants must make sure they're listed on Google Maps and Yelp and OpenTable. Creating a mobile app requires payment of registration fees for listing products on the Google or Apple app stores, and a substantial commission on every sale or subscription. AT&amp;amp;T shouldn't block FaceTime, but Apple has also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/01/apples-new-rule-developers-apps-promoting-apps-duplicating-app-store/\">disallowed</url> the publication of apps that compete with its services. And as for the \"next Netflix,\" so much capital is now required to acquire customers for a successful start-up, the very idea of a bootstrapped one might romanticize an ecosystem long gone. It's absurd to think individual people or small businesses could bend Google or Facebook or the like to their will.<br/>That's just old-fashioned capitalist competition, of course, not a violation of common carriage under the FCC's purview. But the Commission's desire to shift responsibility for internet-provider regulation to the FTC suggests an overdue need to bolster net neutrality with other regulatory oversight-including antitrust, an area the last administration ignored while Obama       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/did-america-need-a-social-media-president/512405/?utm_source=feed\">killed it</url> on social media.<br/>Removing ISPs' common-carriage designation would open the door to antitrust regulation of telcos by the Federal Trade Commission. That's where Pai thinks anticompetitiveness should be adjudicated, which is cold comfort for internet advocates.<br/>So is Trump's chaotic interest in antitrust. Over the last year, the White House has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/18/amazon-jeff-bezos-donald-trump-challenge\">suggested</url> that Amazon in particular should be investigated for antitrust violations. Admittedly, Trump's distaste for the company might be motivated by personal rather than policy interests-Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post, which has published reporting critical of the administration.<br/>In another move that seems contrary to the FCC's support of telcos via a net-neutrality rollback, on Monday the Justice Department       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/trump-att-time-warner/546443/?utm_source=feed\">sued</url> to block a merger of AT&amp;amp;T and Time Warner, a deal that the DOJ claims would unfairly benefit DirecTV. In this case, too, some have speculated that the administration really hopes to punish Time Warner-owned CNN, a network Trump famously despises. The Obama administration might have given tech too much freedom, but Trump's disorganized maelstrom hardly counts as policy, either.<br/>Network neutrality would probably only aid in remedying the tech sector's ills. It could clear the way for new companies with different commitments to security, privacy, advertising, and social responsibility, for example.<br/>But even if that's the case, the turning of the tides in tech reveals how imbalanced power online has become, even after several years of legitimate common-carriage protection. During that time, tech's worst habits have only worsened, and its oligopolistic power has only increased. All those hypothetical \"next Netflixes\" only hope to be acquired by Netflix, or Google, or Facebook anyway.<br/>It's hard to square this reality with the simplistic righteousness of net-neutrality supporters. \"URGENT,\" reads a social-share preview image for one advocacy       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.battleforthenet.com/\">website</url>, \"If you're not freaking out about net neutrality right now, you're not paying attention.\" Some proponents even compare the twilight of common carriage to the state-sponsored censorship of the internet in China or North Korea. Yes, internet service providers should be regulated as common carriers. But though necessary, that solution isn't sufficient.<br/>It never has been. Way back in 2014, even before common carriage for ISPs was realized, I floated the same argument       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/what-do-we-save-when-we-save-the-internet/370885/?utm_source=feed\">here at The Atlantic</url>: \"Common carriage is sensical and reasonable,\" I wrote. \"But there's also something profoundly terrible about the status quo.\" But then as now, even despite the revelation of endless calamity at the hands of the industry that has benefitted from a supposedly free and open internet, questioning the legitimacy and justice of that freedom and openness is still considered obscene.<br/>If the internet is to remain a public utility, it must also become a public utility worth using, and one that doesn't dismantle the society that would use it through neglect and deceit and malice. It's time to stop treating the internet as a flawless treasure whose honor must be protected from desecration. It hasn't been such for a long time, if indeed it ever was.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-networkneutralitycantfixtheinternet546620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8J-1G61-DYY9-J10V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1984\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Banken und Sparkassen m\u00fcssen in dieser Welt der Plattformen und kosysteme ihr Rollenverstndnis neu definieren.Open Banking erfordert neue Geschftsmodelle im Rahmen eines kosystems.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.der-bank-blog.de/newsletter\">https://www.der-bank-blog.de/newsletter</url>/ Der Begriff Open Banking wird in der derzeitigen Diskussion in einer sehr groen Bankbreite genutzt - von den ersten Schritten zur ffnung der Konteninfrastruktur der Banken im Rahmen der PSD2[1] bis hin zur einer weitgehenden Integration von Finanzdienstleistungen in den Kontext der Customer Journeys \u00fcberregionaler kosysteme. Whrend die regulatorisch bedingte ffnung der Konteninfrastruktur sowie der damit einhergehende Zugang zu Kunden- und Transaktionsdaten in Europa derzeit Realitt wird, steht die Entwicklung eines echten, weitreichenden Open Banking Ansatzes erst am Anfang. </p><p>Gepaart mit sich wandelnden Kundenerwartungen und dem verstrkten Markteintritt etablierter Technologieunternehmen verndert Open Banking die Finanzindustrie von einem zentralisierten System zu einer offenen Architektur.Die zunehmende ffnung der Banken ist jedoch nicht nur ein europisches Phnomen. Auch in anderen Regionen gibt es eine Vielzahl von regulatorischen, aber auch marktgetrieben Initiativen, die alle eine strkere Verzahnung von Banken und Nichtbanken vorantreiben. Um das gesamte Potenzial einer weitreichenden globalen Entwicklung zu einem echten Open Banking[2] sowie seine Auswirkungen auf die Geschftsmodelle der Banken zu verstehen, lohnt sich ein Blick auf weitere fundamentale Vernderungen im Umfeld von Finanzinstituten. Neue Kundenbed\u00fcrfnisse, Technologien und Wettbewerber In den vergangenen Jahren haben sich das Umfeld der Banken und damit auch ihre Wettbewerbssituation signifikant gewandelt. Wesentliche Treiber sind dabei die folgenden: Kundenerwartungen und -bed\u00fcrfnisse verndern sich speziell bei j\u00fcngeren Kunden. Aufgrund ihrer Erfahrungen mit sozialen Medien und den f\u00fcr sie sehr prsenten Technologieunternehmen wie Amazon, Apple, Google, Alibaba und Tencent erwarten sie in der Interaktion mit Unternehmen sowie bei der Nutzung von deren Produkte und Leistungen eine sehr hohe Kundenfreundlichkeit und intuitive Bedienbarkeit, eine nahtlose Verbindung von online und offline, personalisierte und mageschneiderte L\u00f6sungen, stndige Erreichbarkeit sowie eine reibungslose Integration in die entsprechende Customer Journey. Auf der anderen Seite wird es f\u00fcr Kunden jedoch zunehmend irrelevant, welcher Akteur im Hintergrund standardisierte Leistungen wie zum Beispiel Bezahlvorgnge anbietet und abwickelt.Die Entwicklung, Verbreitung und zunehmende Reife neuer Technologien erm\u00f6glichen eine wachsende Vernetzung und v\u00f6llig neue M\u00f6glichkeiten in der Generierung, Analyse und Nutzung von Daten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus f\u00fchren diese Technologien zu einer grundlegenden Transformation der Distributionsmechanismen und damit der Art, wie, von wem und in welcher Geschwindigkeit Finanzdienstleistungen direkt an die Kunden geliefert werden k\u00f6nnen.FinTechs entwickeln aufgrund ihres teilweise sehr tiefen Verstndnisses f\u00fcr Kundenbed\u00fcrfnisse und ihres agilen Mindsets mageschneiderte L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr spezifische Segmente der Wertsch\u00f6pfungskette von Banken und bewirken damit eine zunehmende Fragmentierung und Modularisierung. Dar\u00fcber hinaus integrieren etablierte Technologieunternehmen verstrkt Finanzdienstleistungen in die bestehenden Customer Journeys ihrer kosysteme und bieten aufgrund der Tiefe und Vielfalt ihrer Daten sowie ihrer Erfahrung eine \u00fcberzeugende Kundenerfahrung. Beispiele reichen von Amazon payments \u00fcber Apple Pay, alipay, Wechat pay zu dem neu angek\u00fcndigten Facebook Pay. Whrend es aufgrund der umfangreichen Regulierungsanforderungen im Banksektor f\u00fcr Big Tech Firmen derzeit noch nicht unbedingt attraktiv ist, ein vollumfngliches Produktportfolio anzubieten und zu Vollbanken zu werden, rundet das Angebot von Leistungen wie Payments, Finanzierungen und Asset Management das Portfolio ihrer kosysteme auf nat\u00fcrliche Weise ab, verstrkt die Loyalitt und Bindung ihrer Kunden sowie deren Prsenz auf den entsprechenden Plattformen und generiert weitere wertvolle Daten. Auch wenn die Leistungen im Hintergrund durch Banken bereitgestellt werden - die Kundenschnittstelle wird zunchst durch die Technologieunternehmen besetzt.Aufbau und Integration von Plattformen und kosystemen Die Kombination dieser Entwicklungen f\u00fchrt zu einem sogenannten Contextual Banking, in dem Finanzprodukte genau dort und dann angeboten werden, wo der Kunden sie im Rahmen seiner sonstigen Aktivitten gerade ben\u00f6tigt: Der Zahlvorgang wird nahtlos in den Kaufprozess eingebunden und konkrete Vorschlge zur Finanzierung in den Suchprozess des Kunden. Dies erfordert unter anderem eine umfangreiche und gegenseitige technische Anbindung. Dieser Trend spiegelt sich in der stetigen Zunahme und Vielfalt der APIs im Finanzbereich wieder, deren Anzahl von einigen wenigen Schnittstellen in 2006 und 2007 gem dem API Directory von ProgrammableWeb[3] bis \u00fcber 1.800 in Mitte 2019 angestiegen ist.Die zunehmende Integration von verschiedenen Leistungen und damit einhergehende formelle und informelle Vernetzung von Anbietern f\u00fchrt dabei zu der Entstehung und dem Wachstum von Plattformen und kosystemen, in denen Nutzer eine groe Bandbreite ihrer Bed\u00fcrfnisse in einem aufeinander abgestimmten und weitgehend friktionslosen Kundenerlebnis befriedigen k\u00f6nnen. Die Gefahr f\u00fcr Banken besteht dabei darin, dass sie speziell bei Standardleistungen wie Payments kaum noch eigenstndig wahrgenommen werden und die Kundenschnittstelle damit zunehmend durch den Retailer bzw. den Betreiber der Plattform besetzt wird. Banken m\u00fcssen sich daher \u00fcberlegen, wie sie eine prominente Rolle im Rahmen von bestehenden Plattformen und kosystemen spielen bzw. selber zum Betreiber einer (Banking-)Plattform werden k\u00f6nnen. Dies bedingt jedoch, dass Banken im Rahmen von Allianzen und Partnerschaften auch nicht-Finanzdienstleistungen in ihren Auftritt integrieren und damit ein \u201eBeyond Banking' Angebot bieten. Was Banken von bestehenden kosystemen lernen k\u00f6nnen Banken k\u00f6nnen eine Menge von existierenden erfolgreichen Plattformen und kosystemen lernen. Ein Kernaspekt ist, dass der Nutzen und damit der Wert einer Plattform mit der Zahl der Anbieter und Nutzer steigen. Dies zeigen z.B. App-Stores, Ride-Sharing Apps wie Uber oder Marktpltze wie Airbnb. Schnelle Skalierbarkeit erzeugt eine positive Dynamik und damit eine kritische Masse. Die Auswahl der richtigen Partner ist ebenfalls entscheidend. Erfolgreiche Spieler erzeugen Inhalte nur bis zu einem gewissen Grad selbst bzw. in manchen Fllen sogar gar nicht. WeChat beispielsweise integriert eine Reihe von Diensten \u00fcber Miniprogramme, die von WeChat nicht selbst entwickelt und betrieben werden, aber \u00fcber die App ohne zustzliche Installationen genutzt werden - eine Art App in der App, \u00fcber die beispielsweise Partner wie Starbucks und MacDonalds sowie einige Luxusmarken angebunden sind. Bei Amazon ist der Anteil des physischen Brutto-Warenumsatz durch unabhngige third party Verkufer von 3 Prozent in 2000 auf 58 Prozent in 2018 angestiegen. Der Nutzen f\u00fcr die Kunden besteht neben der Vielfalt der Angebote auch in der nahtlosen und sicheren Integration attraktiver Partner.Neben einer klaren Differenzierung \u00fcber Mehrwerte ist auch ein \u00fcberzeugendes Kundenerlebnis entscheidend. Hierf\u00fcr ist eine konsequente Ausrichtung entlang der Kundenbed\u00fcrfnisse und der Customer Journeys notwendig sowie eine holistische Kundensicht, die sich in jeder Lebenssituation und bei jeder Interaktion \u00fcber alle Zugangskanle und Kontaktpunkte widerspiegelt. F\u00fcr Banken bedeutet dies jedoch auch, das Blickfeld und den Aktionsradius \u00fcber reine Finanzdienstleistungen hinaus entlang der Customer Journeys zu erweitern. Um Innovationen voranzutreiben und Netzwerke zu managen, wird dar\u00fcber hinaus auch ein anderes Skill-Set auf Seiten eines Teils der Mitarbeiter notwendig: Klare Kundenorientierung, unternehmerisches Denken, eine gute Fehlerkultur und eine gewisse Risikobereitschaft, Flexibilitt und Agilitt sowie solides Komplexittsmanagement werden immer erfolgskritischer. Neue Geschftsmodelle auf Basis bestehender Strken Banken m\u00fcssen sich \u00fcberlegen, wie sie auf Basis ihrer bestehenden Strken in Zukunft ihr Geschftsmodell definieren k\u00f6nnen und wollen. Das Spektrum der M\u00f6glichkeiten ist hierbei stark abhngig von der Intensitt der Kundenbasis und -beziehung sowie der Quantitt und Qualitt der Kundendaten, von der Attraktivitt und Breite des Produkt- und Serviceportfolio, von der funktionalen Expertise in Bereichen wie Analytics, Compliance, Risikobewertung, Effizienz und Volumen der Abwicklungsprozesse etc. sowie der Fhigkeit zur Bereitstellung von Liquiditt und zur Risiko\u00fcbernahme. Banken mit starker regionaler Verwurzelung k\u00f6nnen beispielsweise durch den Aufbau von eher lokalen Netzwerken und die Verbindung von online und offline Mehrwerte schaffen, andere k\u00f6nnen sich als Produkt- oder funktionale Spezialisten in bestehende groe Plattformen und kosysteme integrieren und so ihre Reichweite signifikant erh\u00f6hen. So plant beispielsweise JP Morgan \u00fcber seine eWallet Unternehmen wie Amazon und Airbnb virtuelle Konten f\u00fcr ihre Kunden zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen, wobei die komplette Abwicklung \u00fcber JP Morgan laufen soll. Relevanz bei Kunden erfordert Adaption der Geschftsmodelle Wie immer individuelle L\u00f6sungen aussehen werden, eine ffnung gegen\u00fcber nicht-Banken und damit eine Anpassung ihrer Geschftsmodelle an ein immer strker werdendes Open Banking wird f\u00fcr Banken zur klaren Pflicht. Nur so k\u00f6nnen sie angesichts der sich ndernden Kundenerwartungen, der Konsequenzen neuer Technologien wie weitreichende Data Analytics und neue Distributionsmechanismen und der immer strkeren Dominanz von Plattformen und kosystemen weiter relevant f\u00fcr die Endkunden bleiben. Erfolgskritisch f\u00fcr eine gute K\u00fcr ist die Schaffung von klaren kundenzentrierten Mehrwerten, die Auswahl und das Management der richtigen strategischen Partner und damit der Aufbau von oder die Integration in erfolgreiche Plattformen bzw. kosysteme.

NeurIPS is one of the first and largest AI research conferences to enact the requirements. The social impact statement will require AI researchers to confront and account for both positive and negative potential outcomes of their work, while the financial disclosure requirement may illuminate the role industry and big tech companies play in the field. Financial disclosures must state both potential conflicts of interests directly related to the submitted research and any potential unrelated conflict of interest. </p><p>NeurIPS 2020 communications chair Michael Littman told VentureBeat in an email that the 'ethical aspects and future societal consequences' statements will be published with each paper. However, they'll appear only in the camera-ready versions of the papers so they do not compromise the double-blind nature of the reviewing process. Research with potential ethical concerns will be given special consideration.'Reviewers and area chairs' assessment will be done on the basis of technical contributions only. However, if a paper is flagged for potential ethical concerns, then the paper will be sent to another set of reviewers with expertise in ethics and machine learning. The final acceptance of these papers is contingent on the positive assessment by these second set of reviewers as well,' Littman said. At a town hall last year, NeurIPS 2019 organizers suggested[1] that researchers this year may be required to state their model's carbon footprint, perhaps using calculators like ML CO2 Impact[2]. The impact a model will have on climate change can certainly be categorized as related to 'future societal impact,' but no such explicit requirement is included in the 2020 call for papers. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vbtransform.com/'The\">https://www.vbtransform.com/'The</url> norms around the societal consequences statements are not yet well established,' Littman said. 'We expect them to take form over the next several conferences and, very likely, to evolve over time with the concerns of the society more broadly. Note that there are many papers submitted to the conference that are conceptual in nature and do not require the use of large scale computational resources, so this particular concern, while extremely important, is not universally relevant.' Responses to the new rules vary.To be clear, I don't think this is a positive step. Societal impacts of AI is a tough field, and there are researchers and organizations that study it professionally. Most authors do not have expertise in the area and won't do good enough scholarship to say something meaningful. \u2014 Roger Grosse (@RogerGrosse) February 20, 2020[3]Roger Grosse, a faculty member at the Vector Institute for AI at the University of Toronto, complained that the new policy will 'lead to trivialization of important issues.' Grosse is a member of CIFAR leadership[4] and suggested corporate sponsors be required to share statements about their broader impact on society. In recent years, NeurIPS has faced criticism for the growing role of the major AI research arms of tech giants like Google AI, OpenAI, and Facebook AI Research (FAIR). In response to Grosse's argument that social impact should be left to researchers who focus on ethics or social impact, Joe Redmon said he stopped doing computer vision research because of his concerns about the potential dangerous impacts it could have on the world. Redmon created the YOLO[5] real-time object detection system together with Ali Farhadi, whose company, Xnor, was recently acquired by Apple[6]. Redmon described himself as a person who used to buy into the myth that science is apolitical. He declared that virtually no facial recognition research would get published if the broader society impact was taken seriously.I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was having. I loved the work but the military applications and privacy concerns eventually became impossible to ignore.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/DMa6evaQZr\">https://t.co/DMa6evaQZr</url>[7] \u2014 Joe Redmon (@pjreddie) February 20, 2020[8]Last month, Deborah Raji, a fellow at the AI Now Institute at New York University, introduced an internal auditing framework for businesses to evaluate the ethical performance of their AI systems and close what she and coauthors call an 'AI accountability gap.'[9] The framework draws on tools for documenting impact like data sheets for data sets and model cards from Google AI. It also draws on regulatory practices from other industries like aviation and pharmaceutical drug testing. 'I think there's a lot of things that we don't do that other fields do,' Raji told VentureBeat in a phone interview. Raji said requiring social impact statements at conferences like NeurIPS may be emerging in response to the publication of ethically questionable research at conferences in the past year, such as a comment-generating algorithm that can disseminate misinformation in social media. She calls the new rules a step in the right direction. 'Industry is just very present [in the AI research field], so the way that things get operationalized, the rapidness through which it enters the market and industry, is so quick that it makes sense for you to actually be thinking about how your work is going to be interpreted and how it's going to be used, and I think that forcing researchers to take the time to do that is going to be important with respect to getting them to be more reflective on the impact of their work,' she said. Raji calls attitudes that say only researchers focused on ethics or social impact should evaluate a model 'a misunderstanding of your responsibility as a researcher.' 'In my education, we weren't really given a vocabulary around any of this. I think that's why people are freaking out a little bit, but ultimately it's not that big a deal,' she said. Conference organizers shared new rules alongside a call for papers last week[10] for the 34th annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference (NeurIPS). The conference will take place in December in Vancouver, Canada. NeurIPS papers are due May 12.

The change gives internet service providers more opportunity to make money, but may hurt smaller businesses and internet users along the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even though the West is home to some of the most important players in the tech industry, its rural areas often suffer from lack of internet access - a problem some argue could be solved by loosening net neutrality regulations. Open internet advocates, however, believe that net neutrality is essential to the free exchange of ideas and information on the internet.</p><p>There is broad bipartisan support for the regulations; a University of Maryland poll found more than 80 percent of respondents opposed repealing them. Now, Western states are leading the push for net neutrality, arguing that the regulations are necessary to foster innovation and prevent big corporations like AT&amp;T and Comcast from monopolizing the web.</p><p>Montana's Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock was the first state leader to issue an executive order aimed at upholding net neutrality, and the attorneys general of Oregon, California, Washington and New Mexico have joined a nationwide lawsuit against the FCC. Six Western state legislatures are considering or have passed bills that would enforce net neutrality on a statewide level. By opposing the federal policy and enacting their own regulations, states can signal to big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Netflix - which all support net neutrality - that they are friendly to the cause. \"What states are responding to is a very public outcry for net neutrality,\" said Christopher Ali, a media studies professor at the University of Virginia.</p><p>The FCC's recent decision undid its own 2015 ruling classifying the internet as a telecommunications service, which gave the agency the authority to regulate internet providers and prevent them from discriminating against or favoring website content.</p><p>In Congress, the net neutrality debate has generally been split along party lines, with Republicans favoring less regulation and Democrats preferring stronger protections. Oregon Rep. Greg Walden, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Wyoming Sens. John Barrasso and Mike Enzi are some of the staunchest supporters of rolling back net neutrality rules. They and other critics argue that the FCC was overstepping its authority and that the new regulations were unnecessary. Lighter regulations, they say, would give internet providers more incentives to invest in rural communities.</p><p>A March 2016 policy paper from the Senate Republican Policy Committee, chaired by Barrasso, said, \"FCC Chairman Wheeler's open internet order will stifle innovation and investment in internet infrastructure and jobs; create uncertainty; and lead to years of litigation.\"</p><p>Travis Kavulla, the vice chairman of Montana's Public Service Commission, said rural consumers could benefit from less regulation. For example, \"Providers could partner with companies like Netflix to create cheaper internet packages.\" Kavulla added that regulators should keep a close eye on one-provider markets - and step in to protect consumers if necessary - but that they should wait for problems to arise rather than making restrictive laws beforehand.</p><p>In supporting net neutrality, states are thumbing their noses at the FCC, which had declared that states could not develop their own protections. On Jan. 22, Bullock issued an executive order declaring that Montana would not give contracts to internet providers that don't adhere to net neutrality principles. \"There has been a lot of talk around the country about how to respond to the recent decision by (the) FCC,\" said Bullock. \"It's time to actually do something about it,\" he said. He called on other states to follow Montana's lead, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D, quickly signed an executive order of his own.</p><p>Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and New Mexico have proposed legislation to protect net neutrality on a statewide basis. The California State Senate passed a bill on Jan. 29 that would introduce even stronger protections than those previously in place at the FCC; the bill now awaits passage in the state Assembly. The Washington Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill on Feb. 27 that prevents internet providers in the state from slowing down or blocking legal content or creating \"fast lanes\" that prioritize paid content. Attorneys general from Oregon, California, Washington and New Mexico have joined a lawsuit with 17 other states and Washington, D.C., that argues the FCC's recent ruling was not justified and that the changes were not supported by sufficient legal evidence.</p><p>Having a patchwork of net neutrality protections that varies by state is not the ideal way to regulate the internet, but it could become the status quo if state and federal lawmakers continue to butt heads. The conflict is the latest example of states pushing back against the Trump administration's broad deregulatory agenda. Western states have been at the forefront of addressing climate change after Trump signaled his intent to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord, and they seem poised to continue the push for net neutrality. \"We can't wait for folks in Washington, D.C., to come to their senses and reinstate these rules,\" said Bullock.</p><p>Carl Segerstrom is an editorial intern at High Country News. t

He's going to add $6 trillion to our national debt. Perfect. And guess who'll be paying that off -- young people in this country. More burdened ever before, they are making thousands less than their parents did decades ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And speaking of big budgets? How about the price tags of those Super Bowl ads? Most of that money spent depressing us. We're going to dig into that one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good luck getting back from the big game. Dangerous weather in some parts of the country causing travel chaos everywhere. Because even when they say it's not, it's always about money.</p><p>The $4 trillion budget. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>unveiling his proposal earlier today, saying the country can afford the hefty price tag.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Since I took office we have cut our deficits by about two-thirds. That's the fastest period of sustained deficit reduction since after the demobilization at the end of World War II. So we can afford to make these invests while remaining fiscally responsible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: It's interesting considering the White House expects it to add nearly $6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.</p><p>Let's bring in today's panel. James Freeman of -- from the \"Wall Street Journal\". Todd Starnes is from Fox News Radio. John Lonski is here as well from Moody's. You're their chief economist. All you take the crack out of it. Can we afford this -- no problem?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, maybe you can afford it today but if you look forward at the funding demands from the retirement of a -- forthcoming retirement of Baby Boomers, a pressure being placed on Medicare along with us, the unknown costs of the Affordable Care Act -- never mind the possibility of another recession -- no, you cannot afford it longer term.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, I don't even think we can afford it today.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR: Yeah. And just to be clear, the -- this White House math you need to translate a little. When he's saying.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, please.</p><p>FREEMAN: . we've done a great job.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, please.</p><p>FREEMAN: . of deficit reduction, historic, what he leaves out that first year of '09 with the stimulus was highest deficit since World War II. So the fact that he gave.</p><p>FRANCIS: He's using that as base..</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. He gave us four straight years of trillion plus deficits. And now that it's gone down to 500,000 million.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . in any other time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Would be horrible?</p><p>FREEMAN: . would be considered horrible and irresponsible.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . he is taking credit for the reduction. But no entitlement reform in this budget.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: So when we talk about future problems, no effort to fix them along with all the spending.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. And, Todd, you know, he's talking about taxing U.S. companies on overseas profits saying they should be paying their fair share. I love it when we say things like that. We're one of only countries in the world that wants to do something like this -- tax companies on their overseas profits. So it's basically unheard of around the globe.</p><p>TODD STARNES, FOX NEWS &amp; COMMENTARY HOST: That's right. And you'll hear this president also say that he wants to look after the middle class. Well, middle class incomes under this president have gone down $4,000 annually. This is a very, very troubling time for American families.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: And quite frankly, I don't any anybody is looking out for the working man in America.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Meanwhile, \"Ale to the chief\", NBC asking the really tough questions during the Super Bowl interview with <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: We make beer -- first president since George Washington to make some booze in the White House. Let's taste it.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Right. Well, I'll let.</p><p>OBAMA: It's been well-reviewed.</p><p>GUTHRIE: . football or basketball?</p><p>OBAMA: I'm still a basketball guy but I love football.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Offense or defense?</p><p>OBAMA: Always offense.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Wings or chips and guac?</p><p>OBAMA: Now, that's tough. You know, I'm going chips and guac. I'm a fanatic about guac.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?</p><p>OBAMA: Love them both.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARNES: Oh, Geezle (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow. I mean it makes GloZell look hard-hitting. Right? I mean doesn't it make you hunger for the green lipstick again? I mean, she really -- wow. Yeah. Impressed, Todd?</p><p>STARNES: OK. For the record here, let's do some history. And the president seems to thinks we still have 57 states. President Washington did not live in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>STARNES: . the White House. So Mr. President, let's do some history there -- history research. Here is the issue I have. Aside from the fact that you're right, GloZell asked a more hard-hitting questions than Savannah Guthrie did, the bigger issue here is the president and the image he conveys here. He is hoisting and zipping a glass of organic honey ale.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>STARNES: . with pinky finger extended.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: What kind of message does that send our enemies?</p><p>FRANCIS: James, don't you do that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Not.</p><p>FRANCIS: No?</p><p>FREEMAN: . well, you just kind of knew it was going to be a pumpkin or honey flavored ale.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . but the.</p><p>FRANCIS: You should have that feeling.</p><p>FREEMAN: .. talking about broadcast history, back when Fox had the game last year, you had O'Reilly asking about the IRS.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . asking him about the rollout of the health care website. So, yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not.</p><p>FREEMAN: . big contrast in the journalistic coverage.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not guac versus wings? You don't think that is presidential, John?</p><p>LONSKI: This is a great example of not wasting your time watching pre-game shows.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: . it's a perfect example of it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely.</p><p>STARNES: Can I ask you this though?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: Did anyone else notice that Savannah Guthrie, the female anchor - - they decided to do interview in a kitchen? I mean what sort of optics does send this whole war on women?</p><p>FRANCIS: There you go. I love it. All right. And ratings record for the Super Bowl -- not that interview, but for the Super Bowl itself. The dramatic finish helping the event score the highest overnight rating in history -- up 4 percent from last year. So if you leaped through that interview at beginning -- and I got to tell you I didn't even watch it, I watched parts of it later all I could stomach -- but the game was phenomenal. James. What did you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: You loved the game?</p><p>FREEMAN: Until the end.</p><p>FRANCIS: I saw you in the hallway. You looked a little bitter.</p><p>FREEMAN: Absolutely. And I'm still bitter. I.</p><p>FRANCIS: I feel like you're a Seahawks guy.</p><p>FREEMAN: . this is a team -- this is basically the greatest team in the last 15 years, now, caught twice breaking the rules. And you could argue about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Come on.</p><p>FREEMAN: . intent. You can argue about who was it? Was it the equipment guy or whatever? But I don't think that's.</p><p>FRANCIS: The lone wolf ball boy in the bathroom.</p><p>STARNES: By the way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>STARNES: . on plus side, did you see.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>STARNES: . Katy Perry straddling the mechanical lion there? Did you catch the nuance on field? She was parading through a field of inflated balls.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow. John Lonski.</p><p>STARNES: I don't know what that means.</p><p>FRANCIS: . you want to come out and try to top that joke?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I can't top that one but you have to admit, the Patriots denied everything -- any wrongdoing. They had no knowledge of it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. So you're counting them a break. You think that -- and you're totally ignoring inflated balls coming?</p><p>LONSKI: The eye of the tiger.</p><p>FREEMAN: No one disputes the inflation of the balls were.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. All right.</p><p>STARNES: Either fireworks otherwise.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's do something serious here. Oil staging a rally, currently up for the third day in a row. That is shockingly crude's longest winning streak more than five months. John, I feel you'll be on solid ground with this one -- for oil.</p><p>LONSKI: Yeah. Production.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: . production are showing their.</p><p>FRANCIS: There you go.</p><p>LONSKI: . back on prices. You've really cut back on rig count in the United States -- down 20 percent to 30 percent. Capital spending by oil companies is dropping.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: So it follows that oil prices begin to move higher.</p><p>FRANCIS: A lot of people talking about these strikes that are going on at refineries around the country. And that -- I mean it's surprising to see crude rally in the face of that because normally, it would mean there'd be less demand for crude oil. So crude would fall, if refineries are on strike. It could be bad news for consumers, right, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah. I think John is solid on every topic for the record.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. That's right. Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: But we, you know, we could see price rises here. You would talk about some reduction in drilling in North America. And of course if strikes threaten production, that's going to make the price go up.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. This is a big story. Tale of two groundhogs today. Punxsutawney Phil seeing a shadow this morning seeing six more weeks of winter. But the groundhog of record in my book is Staten Island Chuck, he is predicting the end of winter. Although, we don't know who that really is because of course Mayor de Blasio killed Staten Island Chuck last year when he dropped him on his head. It turns out that wasn't even Staten Island Chuck, it was his sister Charlotte that, you know, capped last year in the middle of this whole thing.</p><p>And here we go. We're going to see it. This is where he killed it. So the groundhog died later that night. So the new replacement this year was safely in a glass box to make sure that it didn't get killed by the mayor which was really smart move. I would hide in a glass box as well.</p><p>STARNES: Now, my groundhog is General Beauregard Lee in the Southern States of Atlanta.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm sorry, who?</p><p>STARNES: General Beauregard Lee. Are you not familiar with this?</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>STARNES: Everybody below the Mason-Dixon Line.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>STARNES: . looks to General Lee to determine weather. And he sided with Staten Island Chuck there.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>STARNES: So you got the Yankees and the southerners.</p><p>FRANCIS: You think it is over?</p><p>STARNES: I think so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is he afraid of Mayor de Blasio? Does he know about the murder that happened last year?</p><p>STARNES: I think he does but, you know, as -- the ground hogs are known as yellow-bellied marmots, not biblical sense of the word but that's what they're officially called. And.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are you just making this up?</p><p>STARNES: No, I'm not making this up, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're just making this up?</p><p>STARNES: Melissa, I am not making this up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Who is this guy? What? Do you want to try to weigh in there?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I would just say Phil has never been afraid to go against the grain on his picks.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's true.</p><p>FREEMAN: So I like it when he's out there with a bold call.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think you're right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Which yellow-belly marmot are you on the side of, John?</p><p>LONSKI: Traditionalists. Punxsutawney Phil without a doubt. But I'm still confused.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm completely.</p><p>LONSKI: Does he see a shadow or doesn't see a shadow?</p><p>FRANCIS: . confused. I don't know. Everything Todd said confused me. And I love it. All right. Thanks, guys. Better grab those shovels.</p><p>STARNES: I'm honored.</p><p>FRANCIS: More snow is on the way, just in time to ruin your Monday.</p><p>Plus, getting under your skin, the new technology that is opening doors for workers. More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Nothing snaps you out of Super Bowl haze like being stuck in an airport in middle of a snowstorm. Wicked weather across the northeast leaving thousands of travelers stranded. Fox News' Rick Leventhal in LaGuardia Airport, New York. But first, let's go to Fox Business' Jeff Flock. He is all bundled up in Indiana. Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I get all the good time stuff, Melissa. Snow -- big snow -- last time I talked to you, maybe it was the cold, although it's not so warm now. We had blizzard conditions across much of the Midwest over the weekend. And you can see what it has brought. Take a look at all the snow out here.</p><p>Chicago had its largest -- fifth largest snowfall in a 24-hour period in this recorded history. And this is the Lake Michigan lakefront out here. Maybe, you see it. It looks a little bit more like Alaska. A lot of snow fell.</p><p>Fortunately, it has just now, within the last two hours moved off the lake effect snow that we had out here. And it is now back to, well, almost a little bit of sun peeking through. But a lot of snow left. About 18 inches in Chicago alone -- a lot of drifts, even higher than that. Good times in the Midwest, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Thank you so much. Rick, how does it look at the airport?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It's pretty crowded with people trying to find assistance. These lines behind us are not for flight. They're for customer assistance for American Airlines. LaGuardia among the worst nationwide with 604 flights canceled today alone that were scheduled in or out. The number nationwide, much larger -- 3500 coast to coast. And if you add in yesterday and tomorrow, it's more than 5,000 flights.</p><p>We could show you the board here. You see a lot of red up there -- all those canceled flights. Those are arrivals. So if they don't arrive they can't load them up to send them back out again.</p><p>Newark is also bad. Almost 600 flights canceled there. JFK, 140 flights canceled in or out. And the weather outside is pretty bad. It's snowing. There's been a mix of sleet and freezing rain all day. And the conditions are expected to stay bad through tonight.</p><p>And of course, this ripple effect is extending across the country including to Arizona where some 80,000 people were trying to get home from the Super Bowl. That's double the normal traffic at Sky Harbor International making it the busiest day at that airport ever. Hundreds of flights canceled or delayed last night. It's a bit better today -- 27 cancellations, 38 delays.</p><p>But, Melissa, there are worst places to be stuck in Phoenix, where it's 74 and sunny today. Again, it's snowing pretty hard in New York. And it should be bad through tonight. Cancellations and delays are going to continue at least through tomorrow.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rick Leventhal, thank you so much. Thanks to both of you. Get back inside, Jeff. Go back inside. Poor guy.</p><p>All right. ExxonMobil leading energy stocks higher today. Let's go to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for more on that one. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Melissa. Tell Jeff not to freeze any longer than he needs to. Right now, we're looking at oil at $49.23. So oil is gaining for the third day in a row. We haven't seen that since August. And with that energy shares are doing quite well, Melissa. So names such as Exxon and Chevron had been leading the way on Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some of the other big movers including Transocean and Apache have been great reformers.</p><p>It would be interesting to see how with the strike we've been seeing with the United Steelworkers Union and the like, how that may affect gasoline prices on the rise as well. So there is certainly a lot all intertwined together. But energy a bright spot here on Wall Street. Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole, thank you so much. A few stories on our radar right now. Netflix is raising a billion dollars as it fights to keep the top spot in the video streaming market. Part of the debt will fund deals for content and potential acquisitions.</p><p>And in D.C. a would-be White House intruder is in custody after trying to scale a bike rack. The temporary bike rack was in front of the main fence but the man didn't even get that far before secret service agents arrested him.</p><p>Well, it is Super Bowl Monday. Haven't you heard nearly 1.5 million people are calling out sick today -- the day after the Super Bowl. I want to hear from you. What are the craziest excuses for skipping work? Maybe you've used them yourself. Maybe you've heard them. Follow me on Twitter @melissaafrancis or like me on facebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox. We're going to read some of them later.</p><p>All right. The new warnings from the CDC as measles cases climb to highs not seen in decades. What you need to know about the controversy at the heart of it.</p><p>Plus, young, beautiful, oh, so broke. Why you did have it easier than your kids do now. More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some breaking news right now. Source's telling the \"Wall Street Journal\" that Verizon is close to selling assets that include cellphone towers and part of its wireless business. The group of deals is said to bring in more than $10 billion and could be announced as soon as later this week. We're going to stay on top of that story. You could see the stock there is up just slightly right now.</p><p>From the U.S. to every corner of the globe, money is flying around the world today, starting in Spain where thousands of people took to the streets for anti-austerity protests. Some people there are so angry at high unemployment and budget cuts that they're now supporting a radical leftist party. Sound a little like Greece.</p><p>Over to Croatia where the government wants to pay off the debt of its poorest citizens. Around 60,000 people will be given a fresh start. Those eligible have debt under $5,000 and they have no savings or property at all.</p><p>And landing in Sweden where one company is putting microchips in their employees. The chip gives them access to different services, locations within the buildings. You even need it to use the photocopy machine of the company insists that it's completely ethical and the chip is no bigger than a grain of sand. Nothing scary about that.</p><p>All right. The Center for Disease Control issuing a grave warning over the spread of measles saying we could be on the verge of, quote,\"a large outbreak around the country\". Already at least 102 cases have been reported in 14 states. More than half of those, linked to the cluster at California's Disneyland.</p><p>Here now to discuss it is Dr. Devi. She is an assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Devi, break this down for me. How dangerous is this for folks out there? Are you safe if you've had your shot?</p><p>DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ASSISTANT PROFESSOR: You're not totally safe with the shot but, you know, that's the best option that you have. So generally speaking the measles vaccine is pretty effective. But the problem is, there are some people that don't get the measles vaccine, right? And there are people, let's say age one or under, babies that are too young to get the shot. So they are always at risk.</p><p>Now, you also have some folks who are older. Let's say they have some problem with their immune system, whether cancer, HIV, diabetes. They might have had vaccine but they're still a little bit of risk.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. So everybody, in the newspapers, everybody -- this is huge in the media. They're blaming it on this trend in parents who are not getting their kid vaccinated because they believe it leads to other problems. Is it fair to blame this outbreak on folks who are not getting vaccinated?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, I wouldn't blame them. But there's a combination of factors. So in other countries for example, people aren't required always to get the vaccine. So you have foreign visitors who come here who might have had measles. And they can spread it to other folks.</p><p>Now, at Disneyland that's an international destination. So that's why it probably started there but the fact that it took hold in California probably is related to those folks who.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: . opted out of the vaccine.</p><p>FRANCIS: And let me ask you before you go. You know, Parents say that they have the right to decide whether or not their kids are going to have these vaccines. There are certain schools you can't send your kids to unless you have the vaccine back and forth. For parents who don't want to do it, is the science on their side, Dr. Devi?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: The science is not on their side actually. I mean I think most people aren't really opting out because they're concerned about let's say autism or these other things. The science is against all that. They opt out sometimes because they think, \"Measles was eradicated.\" They really need to get another shot for their kid so they have these other issues.</p><p>But the thing is, even though measles was technically eradicated in 2000 it is back now. So when they choose.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: . not to get the vaccine, they're actually not only putting themselves at risk for the kids but putting people around them, even if they had vaccine people could still be at risk.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dr. Devi, thank you so much. Appreciate your time.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Nice seeing you.</p><p>FRANCIS: The measles outbreak giving rise to clash between the White House and the GOP governor. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>emphatically stating that you should get your kids vaccinated. Meanwhile, New Jersey governor Chris Christie should quote, \"make room\", for quote, \"balance for parental choice\".</p><p>James Freeman and Todd Starnes are back with us. So and -- I mean as soon as the politicians start weighing in, you know, it's become a big issue. It's interesting that Governor Chris Christie says, you know that he wants to balance with parental choice. Where does -- Todd, I'll let you go first. Where does that position him?</p><p>STARNES: Well, now, at the Governor's Office, they're walking those statements back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are they?</p><p>STARNES: . through it again. I think that this goes to the heart of the issue with people like Chris Christie among Conservatives and the Republican Party. They're concerned that Governor Christie wants to take rights away from mom an dad and give them to big government. And that is a growing concern in this country.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: So he is coming out saying exactly opposite to make sure people understand he is saying it.</p><p>STARNES: That's right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead. What were you going to say?</p><p>FREEMAN: The president is right. This is not issue of big government. This is basic social responsibility. I mean this -- the measles are much more contagious than the flu. And we did talk with Dr. Devi, but before we had vaccines, hundreds of people died every year. You can add to that list polio, all of these other diseases that we think of is eradicated.</p><p>If people stop vaccinating, they're coming back. They're going to be deadly. There is no scientific argument not to vaccinate. So, I wish Christie had been stronger when the question came up. It's good if he's now walked back, and said, \"No, you ought to vaccinate.\"</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Thanks, guys. McDonald's uses it's Super Bowl ad to bring families closer but based on social media response maybe they should stick to making fries.</p><p>Plus, all those nachos and six-packs seemed like a great idea last night, didn't they? But today you're another victim of Super Bowl Flu. It is the most popular day of the year to miss at work. And we're bringing you all the lamest excuses. Did you sick out today? Are you watching from home? Smart Money coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: In case you did not see it, the Patriots are the new Super Bowl champs after a very questionable throw failed to seal the deal for the Seahawks. But Seattle didn't just lose the title to New England, losing them on the field they also lost out on a big financial boost. Rich Edson has been crunching all those numbers for us. Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Melissa, especially in valuation, winning teams build a better brand. They can charge more for tickets, merchandise, and ad space.</p><p>Some financial experts we spoke with say, \"The patriots can expect a bump in franchise value because of this win about 10 percent to 15 percent from this year to next.\" That's considerable. As Forbes said, the team is worth more than $2.5 billion second most valuable franchising in the NFL next to the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Last year after winning the Super Bowl, Forbes put the Seahawks value at nearly 25 percent more than the previous season though that growth was inline with league wide valuation increases. And one sales expert says the Patriots as an established franchise can easily capitalize on this when more so than an expected champion from a smaller city.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM CAUCCI, SALES HUDDLE GROUP CEO: The smaller market teams have to get a lot more dynamic and creative with the way they move tickets after winning a Super Bowl. Usually, you see a team go anywhere between eight and 10 percent up in overall ticket pricing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: As for the Patriots, he predicts more dynamic sponsorship offers higher revenue from stadium sweets and more advertising for companies looking to align with the winning brand. Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rich, thank you so much. So we laughed, we cried, we cringed. The Patriots maybe taking home the trophy but there are plenty of other winners and losers from the big game last night.</p><p>Joining me now, Bruce Turkel, CEO of Turkel Brands. James Freeman is back as well. Bruce, let's dig right in. What was the deal with the nationwide dead kid ad? Everybody is talking about it today. I was watching it live on my couch.</p><p>And he's speaking in, you know, I won't be able to do this and that that everybody on my couch mouth dropped wide open. I said, \"This kid's dead. They're going to tell us he's dead.\" Sure enough they did, and we're like Nationwide. So what are they trying to tell us? That we should insure against this so at least you make money when your kid dies? I mean, Bruce, help me. What was the idea behind this?</p><p>BRUCE TURKEL, TURKEL BRANDS CEO: I got to tell you, Melissa, I don't understand that either. Nationwide decided to be the buzz kill of the Super Bowl. This morning I heard someone talking about Obama's budget. And he said, the budget went over like Nationwide's top ad. I mean it's already part of the nomenclature that if you want to be a downer -- you want to be Debbie Downer, you're going to be.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: . with Nationwide.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. Yeah. No. I mean it was (inaudible) and when he says, \"Because I died, my four year old looked up and went, what?\"</p><p>TURKEL: No. I know, it's awful.</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh my gosh. Yeah. You manage to scare my children are in the Super Bowl. Thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL: And how.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL: How insensitive to parents who have lost children. Imagine sitting down to watch the game.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL: . and that's what they confront you with.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: Crazy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. OK. Let's move on to McDonald's. Their pay with love ad. I'm not so sure that was so great. So people come up to the register and you sit there and you -- and they give you your bill and they say, \"You know, what you have to do is call your mother and tell her you love her or whatever it was.\"</p><p>So one of our crack comedy writers on our staff sent out a tweet that said, \"If McDonald's asked me to dance for my food, I'm storming out and going to Wendy's.\"</p><p>So just to compound their error, McDonald's responded to our producer and said. \"Hi, Erin. If you're chosen to participate in Pay in With Love, we have other options if you don't feel comfortable.\" Like their after defending it. And she -- and they said, \"We want this to be fun.\" I mean they sounded like my eight grade Religion teacher. James, what did you think of this one?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, this is a -- you're tough graders.</p><p>FRANCIS: You like this?</p><p>FREEMAN: I didn't think the Nationwide's that bad.</p><p>FRANCIS: What?</p><p>FREEMAN: And as far as McDonald's, Goofy, you know, definitely trying to hard to be adorable. But I think it brought a smile to most of the people in the room I was watching it with. Great. And a lot of people thought it was not really on target. But I wouldn't say it was one of the worst.</p><p>FRANCIS: You weren't bothered by Nationwide, James? You're the first person. You weren't.</p><p>FREEMAN: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: . you're not bothered by Nationwide.</p><p>FREEMAN: I thought it was -- I see what you mean maybe insensitive to people who had suffered some loss. But I thought it was a compelling story. And at the end, it made a good point. And by the way, childhood accidents.</p><p>FRANCIS: Stop. Stop. Stop.</p><p>FREEMAN: . if you want to go after things, football would be last on your list.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. I -- all right, Bruce. Just tell me what you think of McDonald's.</p><p>TURKEL: Well, I'm curious why they didn't partner with \"Superbad\" and they could have Nick Robin (ph). I just got to figure, if you're going to have someone pay with loving, what could go wrong with that. I can't even begin to imagine. Think about all the people that who're going to call their mother and then start arguing. And of course, \"They haven't been to visit.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: . you don't come to see me, but now, you get a free hamburger. Now, you call me?\"</p><p>FRANCIS: I love it. No. That's good stuff. Before we run out of time, I want to talk about one that I like because I'm being so mean. I loved the avocados ad. That was really funny when they're drafting, you know, all the countries are drafting. There was like a polar bear that was hoping for -- I don't know -- what was it like? Australia.</p><p>TURKEL: Mexico.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mexico. Yes, something with beaches, you know, whatever.</p><p>TURKEL: Yes, it had the sombrero (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. It was something from Mexico. Instead, they've draft the avocado which I thought was hysterical. The only thing is, how is -- I mean Avocados from Mexico is supposed to be a nonprofit marketing organization. How did they have $4.5 million to throw to Super Bowl ad? Bruce.</p><p>TURKEL: Well, they probably aren't going to sell an awful lot of avocados. And remember, they're not only trying to get consumers to buy them. This goes to the distribution chain. They want the buyers, the whole sellers, the grocery managers to know about Mexican avocados. California has owned that product. Now Mexico is looking for their opportunity. As far as the money goes, I guess they sell a lot of avocados.</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, they're supposed to be a non-profit -- this group from Mexico. And then, it seems a little.</p><p>FREEMAN: Because they spend all their money on that.</p><p>TURKEL: Like the NFL.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right. We've got to go. Thanks, guys. All right. The past is in the past, unless you are into politics. An unflattering profile of Jeb Bush could shake things up for the GOP frontman.</p><p>And Kanye West might be the only person in the world who isn't happy at a waffle house. Look at how miserable he looks. I guess greasy breakfast carbs smothered in butter and whip cream aren't his thing. At the end of the day, it's all about money and waffles, as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Big tech company is quietly acting to save their advertising revenues. Report say that Google and Microsoft have been painting off a German ad blocker which stop ads from showing on the website. Blocking technology could be seen as a threat to the whole online ad industry -- Yeah, I bet -- which is worth as much as $120 billion.</p><p>Manufacturing fell more than expected last month to a reading of 53.5. Anything above 50 is good but the index has now weakened for the third straight month not a positive sign for the economy.</p><p>And Apple stores will now have safes to protect its new line of smart watches. Gold Apple watches will retail for thousands of dollars. But keep them top the way in the back. That's the latest from the Fox Business Network giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>rolling out his new $4 trillion budget proposal for 2016. The plan includes increased taxes on capital gains and a controversial corporate tax reform. Our own Peter Barnes is at the White House with more. Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, let me reiterate the highlights of this drilling down into the $4 trillion. The president wants to spend $1.1 trillion in discretionary spending. That would be a 7 percent increase from the current fiscal year, about $75 billion in additional spending split evenly -- about evenly between the Defense Department and non-defense programs. And he wants to blow through the sequester of 2011.</p><p>He is also looking at more than trillion dollars in tax increases on higher income families raising capital gains tax rates, by applying it to inheritances, to raising the state taxes, by limiting tax deductions for wealthier families. He proposes nearly $500,000 million in new spending on infrastructure and highway and bridges. A tax most of that financed with that financed with a new 14 percent on repatriated profits of U.S. companies overseas. The Republicans say this is all a dead on arrival. And they are going to be proposing their own budget. Melissa, back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: So things just as usual. Perfect. Peter, thank you so much.</p><p>BARNES: You bet.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, getting some major love from the Hawkeye State. A new poll from the Des Moines register shows walker leading the way with likely Iowa caucus voters at 15 percent. Senator Rand Paul right on his heels with 14 percent. It is worth noting that this poll was done before Mitt Romney called it quits. Todd Starnes and John Lonski are back to discuss this. Todd, what do you think is this surprising to you that Scott was -- kind of his neck on the woods?</p><p>STARNES: You know, it is his neck of the woods. But when you really step back and look at Scott walker and his story and what he's able to accomplish in Wisconsin, this guy really could be a contender. So I'm excited to see how he does as more people get to know his story and what he did in Wisconsin.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, John, what do you think its economics would mean for the country?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I think his performance in Wisconsin has been excellent from the viewpoint of the markets.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: Right now, it cost only $32 to insure $10,000 worth of Wisconsin government debt. In neighboring Illinois, that premium is over $190. He's done a great job. And this is a difficult.</p><p>FRANCIS: So that's a wonderful point. So explaining to our audience what that means is that he is more credit worthy because of what he has done in the state and how.</p><p>LONSKI: Precisely.</p><p>FRANCIS: . he tights the budget.</p><p>LONSKI: He knows how to run a government and how to control the budget. And that's something I think a lot of Americans very much want from Washington.</p><p>FRANCIS: And nobody in Washington seems to know how to do it all. So he could really bring that math to D.C. That's a good point. All right. Meanwhile, a non-flattering profile of Jeb Bush testing the theory that all press is good press. The \"Boston Globe\" publishing a lengthy write-up on Bush's prep school years with classmates alleging that Bush was a heavy pot smoker and at times he was even a bully which if you have kids right now, you know, that's the worst thing that you could say about a child right now, that they are a bully. I mean that's like one of the big things.</p><p>STARNES: You know, I had a chance to read this piece in the \"Boston Globe\", Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Did you? Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: It's not like he was sitting in his dorm room listening to, you know, barbata rock (ph) and smoking crack. You know, the guy was smoking pot. And maybe he pushed around a couple kids every now and again. They said he was the tallest kid in campus. So he was a little bit of imposing figure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: . but look, they did the same thing with Mitt Romney. The thing that gets me is the double standard here. The mainstream media go after the Republicans but they give the Democrats a pass.</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, I mean he was in high school.</p><p>LONSKI: Oh, yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm so glad I didn't do anything bad in high school. I mean, right.</p><p>LONSKI: Neither did I, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: But the reality is I'd be a hypocrite if I stated that. So we're all hypocrites. You know, we all tell our children not to make the mistakes we made.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: But that does not make us hypocrites.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. No. That's amazing. Meanwhile, the governor Chris Christie meeting with British prime minister David Cameron in London today. The rest of the country, though, they had no idea who he was. A 63-year-old nurse summing up her feelings for Christie by saying, quote, \"I enjoyed American politics, but I've never heard of him.\" She says she enjoys American politics like, \"They're amusing from afar -- those American politics.\" You know, it (inaudible) you guys are idiots but I do not know who this joker is. Like that's basically she said. What do you think, John?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, You know, it's not surprising. They don't know who he is because he hasn't done that great of a job controlling New Jersey's budget, you know, what I referred to earlier.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think they have a clue about New Jersey's budget.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, why.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know local politicians.</p><p>LONSKI: He can't take care of his own house.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: I mean why should you care about him on the global stage?</p><p>STARNES: Yeah. I mean here, he is an anomaly because he hollers at people he doesn't like. They do that all the time.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is right.</p><p>STARNES: So that's a few things but.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right. If you watch the House of Parliament get together and they're all screaming at each other.</p><p>STARNES: They wear haltered wig. That's what I want to know.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I don't know.</p><p>STARNES: How he might go to look with it (ph)?</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. He's trying to look like he has international experience or he can -- and everybody's like. \"Who is this guy?\"</p><p>STARNES: International mystery.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. He didn't wear the red sweater so that counts for something. Thanks, guys. Heading in to the last hour of trading, let's check in with Liz Claman and see what she's got coming up with her program. Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, COUNTDOWN HOST: Well, you just were talking about the Super Bowl commercials, which ones hit it, which ones didn't. Who won the social media show? How about that? Who stole that show? Was it Facebook or Twitter? There is a huge discrepancy, trust me, between the two numbers. Wait until you hear who comes out on top.</p><p>And on top of that, these two experts that we have coming in are going to talk about who stole the actual commercial show. And they are experts. Netbase Aggregates -- a lot of the data. Peter Caswell, their smarty pants guy, he actually has some hard data on who might have won the commercials in here.</p><p>And Lance Ulanoff, Mashable's editor-at-large is very opinionated. And he has a very good sense of the winners there.</p><p>And college students, Melissa, you know they're in the prime of their life. At least, Amazon Prime thinks they are. They are striking deals with universities now to make sure that college kids have the most robin as they need overnight. Yes, Amazon Prime hooking up with all kinds of universities and colleges to grab the college dollars. They need the student body money, Melissa.</p><p>Is this going to be big? Well, Ripley MacDonald of Amazon thinks so. He's the direct or of student programs. That plus the S&amp;P hits a 2015 low. So we're going to be looking at the markets and asking this question of our traders. Time to go to cash? Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>FRANCIS: Liz, sounds like a great show. I can't wait.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>FRANCIS: The Super Bowl going head to head with Hollywood. \"American Sniper\" is still raking in the dough.</p><p>Plus, the Super Bowl hang over. Hopefully, you didn't called out sick today because if you did, you are not alone and we're all very suspicious. You can never have too much money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's who's making and losing money today -- anyone with a piece of Shake Shack. The stock hitting a new low after more than doubling during it's debut last week. That is not so great news for founder Danny Meyer who has more than 7 million shares meaning he lost $9 million since waking up. At least he has delicious burgers to make him feel better. We went to Shake Shack this weekend, it was awesome.</p><p>Plus, working at the Super Bowl -- Missy Elliott. Spotify reporting a streaming increase for the rapper. Her songs are up nearly 700 percent after the game. Missy's hit song, \"Lose Control\" is up more than 1300 percent.</p><p>Headliner, Katy Perry seeing an overall increase around 85 percent for her music. And \"American Sniper\" tops the Box Office again. The Clint Eastwood film raking in more than $30 million this weekend. That brings to the total gross of nearly $250 million. Wow. They're doing well with that one.</p><p>Now, for a little fun with spare change. If you are watching this show from your couch at home, you are not alone. Nearly, 1.5 million Americans are calling out sick today. We're not buying it. Bruce is back with me.</p><p>So Bruce, I love this. It is the most common day of the year to call in sick because it is the first Monday in February. People love to call on sick on Mondays because it just makes sense your week is not quite over. It's the dead of winter. We have a storm going on here on the northeast. And it's the day it's the day after the Super Bowl. In my book, anyone who called in sick today, I'm sorry, looks completely bogus. You're better off coming in to work vomiting on someone and going home, right?</p><p>TURKEL: Absolutely. That was my dad saying, \"Anybody who calls in sick on Monday is not sick.\" We had two in our office but they had good excuses. Allison had a baby on Friday. Roberto is injury duty. So my office is cool.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: I think the rest of them, yeah, it's kind of bogus.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's a little bogus.1.5 million people are expected to call in sick today. 4.4 million arrived late.</p><p>TURKEL: And hung over.</p><p>FRANCIS: And hung over because the Super Bowl was awesome and you had to watch it to the end. Some good excuses that we've heard along the way. My uniform caught fire when I put it in the microwave to dry. I like that one. I accidentally got on a plane. Yup, me too. That's a good one.</p><p>TURKEL: The (inaudible) allows that everyday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, right. Exactly. What are some good ones that you've heard, Bruce?</p><p>TURKEL: The best ones I've heard is the people who call up and try to sound sick and they're talking, \"You know, I can't come in.\" You don't sound sick. And you're trying so hard.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL: . to sound sick. But you know, if you stayed out and had a lot to drink, you woke up a little green and it's my office -- stay away. I don't like your idea of coming in and throwing up on my desk. I can do it without them.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. I don't know. I mean just for myself, if you don't want to want to look like you're calling out and it's not true.</p><p>TURKEL: Prove it.</p><p>FRANCIS: . have you ever called in sick on Super Bowl Monday? Bruce, you strike me as someone who would never call in sick no matter what.</p><p>TURKEL: Never. Never.</p><p>FRANCIS: No?</p><p>TURKEL: Absolutely not.</p><p>FRANCIS: Maybe the NFL should move the game to Saturday night.</p><p>TURKEL: Well, I think they figured out when they can get the highest viewership. Remember, Saturday night is a profitable night for a lot of reasons. Sunday night is not. And so, they show up on Sunday. They get the highest ratings of any show in history. I think they figured out that right. And by the way, the NFL does not care if your employees don't show up for work the next day.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. They definitely -- I mean they focus at the victory because you're at home watching television.</p><p>TURKEL: Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS: So you could be watching other NFL shows, NFL network. I mean it's a win-win all the way around. Bruce Turkel, thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL: Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: So we ask what crazy excuses you've heard for not coming in to work. And you guys didn't disappoint us. On Facebook, Stephanie writes, \"Once I said my cat was sick because I wanted to enjoy the freakish plenty fall Seattle day in my new sports car.\"</p><p>And Andy tweets, \"I dreamed I was fired so I stayed home.\" That was an excuse that he used. Jonathan says, \"I didn't use this myself.\" Sure, Jonathan. \"But a coworker once used, my hair hurts.\" I loved that one. That's somebody who wants to be fired. My hair hurts.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @melissaafrancis or like me on facebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox. If you follow me on Twitter could really fun especially when something bad happens at a restaurant. I'm just saying.</p><p>They may be beautiful, but they're certainly not rich. Young people finally get proved that mom and dad had it easier. So maybe a little help with that cellphone bill isn't out of the question. At the end of the day, it's all about money -- money and Monday.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Celebrities they are just like us. The night before John Legend's super model wife, Chrissy Teigen joined Kim and Kanye West for a quality dinner. Check it out. The foursome hit up a nearby waffle house where Kanye West reported sought (ph) for the entire meal. Like that's really a surprise. So you think he's more of a pancakes or scrambled eggs kind of guy? Why would you not want to go to waffle house for dinner? He's so pouty.</p><p>All right. Crashing student debts. Now, that millennials are making $2,000 less than their parents did at their age, recently released senses data reveals that young people basically everywhere except on the east coast and had seen their earnings drop since 1980. James and John are back with us. Not really surprised but depressing nonetheless. James.</p><p>FREEMAN: It is depressing. I think it goes back to the story that started your broadcast, which is you cannot go after investment and business income because that is the money that funds technology and equipment, which is what allows people to make more money. So if you want these kids to have more salaries, you've to allow businesses to put the technology into the workplace that will justify those higher salaries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: You've got to be careful not to over regulate the economy because the reality today is that these young people will be facing every increasing competition from the skilled and always cheaper workforce of emerging market countries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. And I mean if you look at this as a parent who has no control over those kind of things other than your vote which you have -- but it can be so frustrating to watch our politicians screw things up -- what my takeaway from this is I got to stir my kids towards the jobs where they can actually make money more than ever. You know, look out in the future and -- they got to learn to code and they've got to get out there and do the things that are going to help them because kids are falling behind right?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you want skills that can give them a lot of options. But I think the problem right now it's policy and yes, part of it is K-12 education. But the big part is we're not seeing business creation because we don't have an environment that lets people grow without taxation and regulation. And that really is a -- it's the irony of the Obama era. All the people that he talks about helping.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . have had terrible time since he was elected.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right, John? Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: He's exactly right. That's a sad story because it's actually the lower classes that have feared the worst over the last eight years or so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely. All right, gentlemen. Thanks to both of you. I wanted to show you something fun before we go. Bruce Turkel sent this to me when we were doing our Super Bowl segment. Take a look that. That's Katy Perry in her costume from last night. Right next to her that's Will Ferrell from \"Blades of Glory\".</p><p>I think Katy may have borrowed the costume. What do you think, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah. It's a classic. I mean not quite on the level (inaudible) but it certainly.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . a nommage at the Super Bowl.</p><p>FRANCIS: Fabulous. I know. John, you want to get in there?</p><p>LONSKI: In this side of economy, you got to be much more creative. (inaudible)</p><p>FRANCIS: I love it. Pretty facts. Economics no matter what. My head is off to you, John Lonski. Thank you. That's all the money we have for you. Here's Liz.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

He's  going to add $6 trillion to our national debt. Perfect. And guess who'll be  paying that off -- young people in this country. More burdened ever before,  they are making thousands less than their parents did decades ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And speaking of big budgets? How about the price tags of those Super Bowl  ads? Most of that money spent depressing us. We're going to dig into that  one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good luck getting back from the big game. Dangerous weather in some  parts of the country causing travel chaos everywhere. Because even when  they say it's not, it's always about money.</p><p>The $4 trillion budget. President Obama unveiling his proposal earlier  today, saying the country can afford the hefty price tag.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  Since I took office we have  cut our deficits by about two-thirds. That's the fastest period of  sustained deficit reduction since after the demobilization at the end of  World War II. So we can afford to make these invests while remaining  fiscally responsible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's interesting considering the White House expects it to add  nearly $6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.</p><p>Let's bring in today's panel. James Freeman of -- from the \"Wall Street  Journal\". Todd Starnes is from Fox News Radio. John Lonski is here as well  from Moody's. You're their chief economist. All you take the crack out of  it. Can we afford this -- no problem?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Well, maybe you can afford it today  but if you look forward at the funding demands from the retirement of a --  forthcoming retirement of Baby Boomers, a pressure being placed on Medicare  along with us, the unknown costs of the Affordable Care Act -- never mind  the possibility of another recession -- no, you cannot afford it longer  term.</p><p>FRANCIS:  James, I don't even think we can afford it today.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR:  Yeah. And just to  be clear, the -- this White House math you need to translate a little. When  he's saying.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, please.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . we've done a great job.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, please.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . of deficit reduction, historic, what he leaves out that first  year of '09 with the stimulus was highest deficit since World War II. So  the fact that he gave.</p><p>FRANCIS:  He's using that as base..</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right. He gave us four straight years of trillion plus deficits.  And now that it's gone down to 500,000 million.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . in any other time.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Would be horrible?</p><p>FREEMAN:  . would be considered horrible and irresponsible.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . he is taking credit for the reduction. But no entitlement  reform in this budget.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So when we talk about future problems, no effort to fix them  along with all the spending.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No. And, Todd, you know, he's talking about taxing U.S. companies  on overseas profits saying they should be paying their fair share. I love  it when we say things like that. We're one of only countries in the world  that wants to do something like this -- tax companies on their overseas  profits. So it's basically unheard of around the globe.</p><p>TODD STARNES, FOX NEWS &amp; COMMENTARY HOST:  That's right. And you'll hear  this president also say that he wants to look after the middle class. Well,  middle class incomes under this president have gone down $4,000 annually.  This is a very, very troubling time for American families.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>STARNES:  And quite frankly, I don't any anybody is looking out for the  working man in America.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. Meanwhile, \"Ale to the chief\", NBC asking the really tough  questions during the Super Bowl interview with President Obama.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  We make beer -- first president since George Washington to make  some booze in the White House. Let's taste it.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR:  Right. Well, I'll let.</p><p>OBAMA:  It's been well-reviewed.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  . football or basketball?</p><p>OBAMA:  I'm still a basketball guy but I love football.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Offense or defense?</p><p>OBAMA:  Always offense.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Wings or chips and guac?</p><p>OBAMA:  Now, that's tough. You know, I'm going chips and guac. I'm a  fanatic about guac.</p><p>GUTHRIE:  Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?</p><p>OBAMA:  Love them both.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARNES:  Oh, Geezle (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow. I mean it makes GloZell look hard-hitting. Right? I mean  doesn't it make you hunger for the green lipstick again? I mean, she really  -- wow. Yeah. Impressed, Todd?</p><p>STARNES:  OK. For the record here, let's do some history. And the president  seems to thinks we still have 57 states. President Washington did not live  in.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>STARNES:  . the White House. So Mr. President, let's do some history there  -- history research. Here is the issue I have. Aside from the fact that  you're right, GloZell asked a more hard-hitting questions than Savannah  Guthrie did, the bigger issue here is the president and the image he  conveys here. He is hoisting and zipping a glass of organic honey ale.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>STARNES:  . with pinky finger extended.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yeah.</p><p>STARNES:  What kind of message does that send our enemies?</p><p>FRANCIS:  James, don't you do that?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Not.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No?</p><p>FREEMAN:  . well, you just kind of knew it was going to be a pumpkin or  honey flavored ale.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . but the.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You should have that feeling.</p><p>FREEMAN:  .. talking about broadcast history, back when Fox had the game  last year, you had O'Reilly asking about the IRS.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . asking him about the rollout of the health care website. So,  yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . big contrast in the journalistic coverage.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not guac versus wings? You don't think that is presidential,  John?</p><p>LONSKI:  This is a great example of not wasting your time watching pre-game  shows.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  . it's a perfect example of it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. Absolutely.</p><p>STARNES:  Can I ask you this though?</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>STARNES:  Did anyone else notice that Savannah Guthrie, the female anchor - - they decided to do interview in a kitchen? I mean what sort of optics  does send this whole war on women?</p><p>FRANCIS:  There you go. I love it. All right. And ratings record for the  Super Bowl -- not that interview, but for the Super Bowl itself. The  dramatic finish helping the event score the highest overnight rating in  history -- up 4 percent from last year. So if you leaped through that  interview at beginning -- and I got to tell you I didn't even watch it, I  watched parts of it later all I could stomach -- but the game was  phenomenal. James. What did you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You loved the game?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Until the end.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I saw you in the hallway. You looked a little bitter.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Absolutely. And I'm still bitter. I.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I feel like you're a Seahawks guy.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . this is a team -- this is basically the greatest team in the  last 15 years, now, caught twice breaking the rules. And you could argue  about.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Come on.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . intent. You can argue about who was it? Was it the equipment  guy or whatever? But I don't think that's.</p><p>FRANCIS:  The lone wolf ball boy in the bathroom.</p><p>STARNES:  By the way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>STARNES:  . on plus side, did you see.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>STARNES:  . Katy Perry straddling the mechanical lion there? Did you catch  the nuance on field? She was parading through a field of inflated balls.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wow. John Lonski.</p><p>STARNES:  I don't know what that means.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . you want to come out and try to top that joke?</p><p>LONSKI:  Well, I can't top that one but you have to admit, the Patriots  denied everything -- any wrongdoing. They had no knowledge of it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes. So you're counting them a break. You think that -- and  you're totally ignoring inflated balls coming?</p><p>LONSKI:  The eye of the tiger.</p><p>FREEMAN:  No one disputes the inflation of the balls were.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right. All right.</p><p>STARNES:  Either fireworks otherwise.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Let's do something serious here. Oil staging a rally, currently  up for the third day in a row. That is shockingly crude's longest winning  streak more than five months. John, I feel you'll be on solid ground with  this one -- for oil.</p><p>LONSKI:  Yeah. Production.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  . production are showing their.</p><p>FRANCIS:  There you go.</p><p>LONSKI:  . back on prices. You've really cut back on rig count in the  United States -- down 20 percent to 30 percent. Capital spending by oil  companies is dropping.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  So it follows that oil prices begin to move higher.</p><p>FRANCIS:  A lot of people talking about these strikes that are going on at  refineries around the country. And that -- I mean it's surprising to see  crude rally in the face of that because normally, it would mean there'd be  less demand for crude oil. So crude would fall, if refineries are on  strike. It could be bad news for consumers, right, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yeah. I think John is solid on every topic for the record.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes. That's right. Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But we, you know, we could see price rises here. You would talk  about some reduction in drilling in North America. And of course if strikes  threaten production, that's going to make the price go up.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK. This is a big story. Tale of two groundhogs today.  Punxsutawney Phil seeing a shadow this morning seeing six more weeks of  winter. But the groundhog of record in my book is Staten Island Chuck, he  is predicting the end of winter. Although, we don't know who that really is  because of course Mayor de Blasio killed Staten Island Chuck last year when  he dropped him on his head. It turns out that wasn't even Staten Island  Chuck, it was his sister Charlotte that, you know, capped last year in the  middle of this whole thing.</p><p>And here we go. We're going to see it. This is where he killed it. So the  groundhog died later that night. So the new replacement this year was  safely in a glass box to make sure that it didn't get killed by the mayor  which was really smart move. I would hide in a glass box as well.</p><p>STARNES:  Now, my groundhog is General Beauregard Lee in the Southern  States of Atlanta.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm sorry, who?</p><p>STARNES:  General Beauregard Lee. Are you not familiar with this?</p><p>FRANCIS:  No.</p><p>STARNES:  Everybody below the Mason-Dixon Line.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>STARNES:  . looks to General Lee to determine weather. And he sided with  Staten Island Chuck there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?</p><p>STARNES:  So you got the Yankees and the southerners.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You think it is over?</p><p>STARNES:  I think so.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Is he afraid of Mayor de Blasio? Does he know about the murder  that happened last year?</p><p>STARNES:  I think he does but, you know, as -- the ground hogs are known as  yellow-bellied marmots, not biblical sense of the word but that's what  they're officially called. And.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Are you just making this up?</p><p>STARNES:  No, I'm not making this up, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You're just making this up?</p><p>STARNES:  Melissa, I am not making this up.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Who is this guy? What? Do you want to try to weigh in there?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I would just say Phil has never been afraid to go against  the grain on his picks.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's true.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So I like it when he's out there with a bold call.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think you're right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Which yellow-belly marmot are you on the side of, John?</p><p>LONSKI:  Traditionalists. Punxsutawney Phil without a doubt. But I'm still  confused.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm completely.</p><p>LONSKI:  Does he see a shadow or doesn't see a shadow?</p><p>FRANCIS:  . confused. I don't know. Everything Todd said confused me. And I  love it. All right. Thanks, guys. Better grab those shovels.</p><p>STARNES:  I'm honored.</p><p>FRANCIS:  More snow is on the way, just in time to ruin your Monday.</p><p>Plus, getting under your skin, the new technology that is opening doors for  workers. More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nothing snaps you out of Super Bowl haze like being stuck in an  airport in middle of a snowstorm. Wicked weather across the northeast  leaving thousands of travelers stranded. Fox News' Rick Leventhal in  LaGuardia Airport, New York. But first, let's go to Fox Business' Jeff  Flock. He is all bundled up in Indiana. Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I get all the good time  stuff, Melissa. Snow -- big snow -- last time I talked to you, maybe it was  the cold, although it's not so warm now. We had blizzard conditions across  much of the Midwest over the weekend. And you can see what it has brought.  Take a look at all the snow out here.</p><p>Chicago had its largest -- fifth largest snowfall in a 24-hour period in  this recorded history. And this is the Lake Michigan lakefront out here.  Maybe, you see it. It looks a little bit more like Alaska. A lot of snow  fell.</p><p>Fortunately, it has just now, within the last two hours moved off the lake  effect snow that we had out here. And it is now back to, well, almost a  little bit of sun peeking through. But a lot of snow left. About 18 inches  in Chicago alone -- a lot of drifts, even higher than that. Good times in  the Midwest, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right. Thank you so much. Rick, how does it look at the  airport?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  It's pretty crowded with people  trying to find assistance. These lines behind us are not for flight.  They're for customer assistance for American Airlines. LaGuardia among the  worst nationwide with 604 flights canceled today alone that were scheduled  in or out. The number nationwide, much larger -- 3500 coast to coast. And  if you add in yesterday and tomorrow, it's more than 5,000 flights.</p><p>We could show you the board here. You see a lot of red up there -- all  those canceled flights. Those are arrivals. So if they don't arrive they  can't load them up to send them back out again.</p><p>Newark is also bad. Almost 600 flights canceled there. JFK, 140 flights  canceled in or out. And the weather outside is pretty bad. It's snowing.  There's been a mix of sleet and freezing rain all day. And the conditions  are expected to stay bad through tonight.</p><p>And of course, this ripple effect is extending across the country including  to Arizona where some 80,000 people were trying to get home from the Super  Bowl. That's double the normal traffic at Sky Harbor International making  it the busiest day at that airport ever. Hundreds of flights canceled or  delayed last night. It's a bit better today -- 27 cancellations, 38 delays.</p><p>But, Melissa, there are worst places to be stuck in Phoenix, where it's 74  and sunny today. Again, it's snowing pretty hard in New York. And it should  be bad through tonight. Cancellations and delays are going to continue at  least through tomorrow.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Rick Leventhal, thank you so much. Thanks to both of you. Get  back inside, Jeff. Go back inside. Poor guy.</p><p>All right. ExxonMobil leading energy stocks higher today. Let's go to  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for more on  that one. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  That's right,  Melissa. Tell Jeff not to freeze any longer than he needs to. Right now,  we're looking at oil at $49.23. So oil is gaining for the third day in a  row. We haven't seen that since August. And with that energy shares are  doing quite well, Melissa. So names such as Exxon and Chevron had been  leading the way on Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some of the other big  movers including Transocean and Apache have been great reformers.</p><p>It would be interesting to see how with the strike we've been seeing with  the United Steelworkers Union and the like, how that may affect gasoline  prices on the rise as well. So there is certainly a lot all intertwined  together. But energy a bright spot here on Wall Street. Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Nicole, thank you so much. A few stories on our radar right now.  Netflix is raising a billion dollars as it fights to keep the top spot in  the video streaming market. Part of the debt will fund deals for content  and potential acquisitions.</p><p>And in D.C. a would-be White House intruder is in custody after trying to  scale a bike rack. The temporary bike rack was in front of the main fence  but the man didn't even get that far before secret service agents arrested  him.</p><p>Well, it is Super Bowl Monday. Haven't you heard nearly 1.5 million people  are calling out sick today -- the day after the Super Bowl. I want to hear  from you. What are the craziest excuses for skipping work? Maybe you've  used them yourself. Maybe you've heard them. Follow me on Twitter  @melissaafrancis or like me on facebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox. We're going  to read some of them later.</p><p>All right. The new warnings from the CDC as measles cases climb to highs  not seen in decades. What you need to know about the controversy at the  heart of it.</p><p>Plus, young, beautiful, oh, so broke. Why you did have it easier than your  kids do now. More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have some breaking news right now. Source's telling the \"Wall  Street Journal\" that Verizon is close to selling assets that include  cellphone towers and part of its wireless business. The group of deals is  said to bring in more than $10 billion and could be announced as soon as  later this week. We're going to stay on top of that story. You could see  the stock there is up just slightly right now.</p><p>From the U.S. to every corner of the globe, money is flying around the  world today, starting in Spain where thousands of people took to the  streets for anti-austerity protests. Some people there are so angry at high  unemployment and budget cuts that they're now supporting a radical leftist  party. Sound a little like Greece.</p><p>Over to Croatia where the government wants to pay off the debt of its  poorest citizens. Around 60,000 people will be given a fresh start. Those  eligible have debt under $5,000 and they have no savings or property at  all.</p><p>And landing in Sweden where one company is putting microchips in their  employees. The chip gives them access to different services, locations  within the buildings. You even need it to use the photocopy machine of the  company insists that it's completely ethical and the chip is no bigger than  a grain of sand. Nothing scary about that.</p><p>All right. The Center for Disease Control issuing a grave warning over the  spread of measles saying we could be on the verge of, quote,\"a large  outbreak around the country\". Already at least 102 cases have been reported  in 14 states. More than half of those, linked to the cluster at  California's Disneyland.</p><p>Here now to discuss it is Dr. Devi. She is an assistant professor at the  NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Devi, break this down for me. How dangerous is  this for folks out there? Are you safe if you've had your shot?</p><p>DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ASSISTANT PROFESSOR:  You're  not totally safe with the shot but, you know, that's the best option that  you have. So generally speaking the measles vaccine is pretty effective.  But the problem is, there are some people that don't get the measles  vaccine, right? And there are people, let's say age one or under, babies  that are too young to get the shot. So they are always at risk.</p><p>Now, you also have some folks who are older. Let's say they have some  problem with their immune system, whether cancer, HIV, diabetes. They might  have had vaccine but they're still a little bit of risk.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK. So everybody, in the newspapers, everybody -- this is huge in  the media. They're blaming it on this trend in parents who are not getting  their kid vaccinated because they believe it leads to other problems. Is it  fair to blame this outbreak on folks who are not getting vaccinated?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Well, I wouldn't blame them. But there's a combination of  factors. So in other countries for example, people aren't required always  to get the vaccine. So you have foreign visitors who come here who might  have had measles. And they can spread it to other folks.</p><p>Now, at Disneyland that's an international destination. So that's why it  probably started there but the fact that it took hold in California  probably is related to those folks who.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  . opted out of the vaccine.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And let me ask you before you go. You know, Parents say that they  have the right to decide whether or not their kids are going to have these  vaccines. There are certain schools you can't send your kids to unless you  have the vaccine back and forth. For parents who don't want to do it, is  the science on their side, Dr. Devi?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  The science is not on their side actually. I mean I think  most people aren't really opting out because they're concerned about let's  say autism or these other things. The science is against all that. They opt  out sometimes because they think, \"Measles was eradicated.\" They really  need to get another shot for their kid so they have these other issues.</p><p>But the thing is, even though measles was technically eradicated in 2000 it  is back now. So when they choose.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  . not to get the vaccine, they're actually not only  putting themselves at risk for the kids but putting people around them,  even if they had vaccine people could still be at risk.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dr. Devi, thank you so much. Appreciate your time.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL:  Nice seeing you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  The measles outbreak giving rise to clash between the White House  and the GOP governor. President Obama emphatically stating that you should  get your kids vaccinated. Meanwhile, New Jersey governor Chris Christie  should quote, \"make room\", for quote, \"balance for parental choice\".</p><p>James Freeman and Todd Starnes are back with us. So and -- I mean as soon  as the politicians start weighing in, you know, it's become a big issue.  It's interesting that Governor Chris Christie says, you know that he wants  to balance with parental choice. Where does -- Todd, I'll let you go first.  Where does that position him?</p><p>STARNES:  Well, now, at the Governor's Office, they're walking those  statements back.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Are they?</p><p>STARNES:  . through it again. I think that this goes to the heart of the  issue with people like Chris Christie among Conservatives and the  Republican Party. They're concerned that Governor Christie wants to take  rights away from mom an dad and give them to big government. And that is a  growing concern in this country.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So he is coming out saying exactly opposite to make sure people  understand he is saying it.</p><p>STARNES:  That's right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead. What were you going to say?</p><p>FREEMAN:  The president is right. This is not issue of big government. This  is basic social responsibility. I mean this -- the measles are much more  contagious than the flu. And we did talk with Dr. Devi, but before we had  vaccines, hundreds of people died every year. You can add to that list  polio, all of these other diseases that we think of is eradicated.</p><p>If people stop vaccinating, they're coming back. They're going to be  deadly. There is no scientific argument not to vaccinate. So, I wish  Christie had been stronger when the question came up. It's good if he's now  walked back, and said, \"No, you ought to vaccinate.\"</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right. Thanks, guys. McDonald's uses it's Super Bowl ad to  bring families closer but based on social media response maybe they should  stick to making fries.</p><p>Plus, all those nachos and six-packs seemed like a great idea last night,  didn't they? But today you're another victim of Super Bowl Flu. It is the  most popular day of the year to miss at work. And we're bringing you all  the lamest excuses. Did you sick out today? Are you watching from home?  Smart Money coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  In case you did not see it, the Patriots are the new Super Bowl  champs after a very questionable throw failed to seal the deal for the  Seahawks. But Seattle didn't just lose the title to New England, losing  them on the field they also lost out on a big financial boost. Rich Edson  has been crunching all those numbers for us. Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Melissa,  especially in valuation, winning teams build a better brand. They can  charge more for tickets, merchandise, and ad space.</p><p>Some financial experts we spoke with say, \"The patriots can expect a bump  in franchise value because of this win about 10 percent to 15 percent from  this year to next.\" That's considerable. As Forbes said, the team is worth  more than $2.5 billion second most valuable franchising in the NFL next to  the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Last year after winning the Super Bowl, Forbes put the Seahawks value at  nearly 25 percent more than the previous season though that growth was  inline with league wide valuation increases. And one sales expert says the  Patriots as an established franchise can easily capitalize on this when  more so than an expected champion from a smaller city.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM CAUCCI, SALES HUDDLE GROUP CEO:  The smaller market teams have to get a  lot more dynamic and creative with the way they move tickets after winning  a Super Bowl. Usually, you see a team go anywhere between eight and 10  percent up in overall ticket pricing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  As for the Patriots, he predicts more dynamic sponsorship offers  higher revenue from stadium sweets and more advertising for companies  looking to align with the winning brand. Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Rich, thank you so much. So we laughed, we cried, we cringed. The  Patriots maybe taking home the trophy but there are plenty of other winners  and losers from the big game last night.</p><p>Joining me now, Bruce Turkel, CEO of Turkel Brands. James Freeman is back  as well. Bruce, let's dig right in. What was the deal with the nationwide  dead kid ad? Everybody is talking about it today. I was watching it live on  my couch.</p><p>And he's speaking in, you know, I won't be able to do this and that that  everybody on my couch mouth dropped wide open. I said, \"This kid's dead.  They're going to tell us he's dead.\" Sure enough they did, and we're like  Nationwide. So what are they trying to tell us? That we should insure  against this so at least you make money when your kid dies? I mean, Bruce,  help me. What was the idea behind this?</p><p>BRUCE TURKEL, TURKEL BRANDS CEO:  I got to tell you, Melissa, I don't  understand that either. Nationwide decided to be the buzz kill of the Super  Bowl. This morning I heard someone talking about Obama's budget. And he  said, the budget went over like Nationwide's top ad. I mean it's already  part of the nomenclature that if you want to be a downer -- you want to be  Debbie Downer, you're going to be.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>TURKEL:  . with Nationwide.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No. Yeah. No. I mean it was (inaudible) and when he says,  \"Because I died, my four year old looked up and went, what?\"</p><p>TURKEL:  No. I know, it's awful.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Oh my gosh. Yeah. You manage to scare my children are in the  Super Bowl. Thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL:  And how.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL:  How insensitive to parents who have lost children. Imagine sitting  down to watch the game.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL:  . and that's what they confront you with.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>TURKEL:  Crazy.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right. OK. Let's move on to McDonald's. Their pay with love ad.  I'm not so sure that was so great. So people come up to the register and  you sit there and you -- and they give you your bill and they say, \"You  know, what you have to do is call your mother and tell her you love her or  whatever it was.\"</p><p>So one of our crack comedy writers on our staff sent out a tweet that said,  \"If McDonald's asked me to dance for my food, I'm storming out and going to  Wendy's.\"</p><p>So just to compound their error, McDonald's responded to our producer and  said. \"Hi, Erin. If you're chosen to participate in Pay in With Love, we  have other options if you don't feel comfortable.\" Like their after  defending it. And she -- and they said, \"We want this to be fun.\" I mean  they sounded like my eight grade Religion teacher. James, what did you  think of this one?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this is a -- you're tough graders.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You like this?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I didn't think the Nationwide's that bad.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What?</p><p>FREEMAN:  And as far as McDonald's, Goofy, you know, definitely trying to  hard to be adorable. But I think it brought a smile to most of the people  in the room I was watching it with. Great. And a lot of people thought it  was not really on target. But I wouldn't say it was one of the worst.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You weren't bothered by Nationwide, James? You're the first  person. You weren't.</p><p>FREEMAN:  No.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . you're not bothered by Nationwide.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I thought it was -- I see what you mean maybe insensitive to  people who had suffered some loss. But I thought it was a compelling story.  And at the end, it made a good point. And by the way, childhood accidents.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Stop. Stop. Stop.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . if you want to go after things, football would be last on your  list.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. I -- all right, Bruce. Just tell me what you think of  McDonald's.</p><p>TURKEL:  Well, I'm curious why they didn't partner with \"Superbad\" and they  could have Nick Robin (ph). I just got to figure, if you're going to have  someone pay with loving, what could go wrong with that. I can't even begin  to imagine. Think about all the people that who're going to call their  mother and then start arguing. And of course, \"They haven't been to visit.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>TURKEL:  . you don't come to see me, but now, you get a free hamburger.  Now, you call me?\"</p><p>FRANCIS:  I love it. No. That's good stuff. Before we run out of time, I  want to talk about one that I like because I'm being so mean. I loved the  avocados ad. That was really funny when they're drafting, you know, all the  countries are drafting. There was like a polar bear that was hoping for --  I don't know -- what was it like? Australia.</p><p>TURKEL:  Mexico.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Mexico. Yes, something with beaches, you know, whatever.</p><p>TURKEL:  Yes, it had the sombrero (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right. It was something from Mexico. Instead, they've draft the  avocado which I thought was hysterical. The only thing is, how is -- I mean  Avocados from Mexico is supposed to be a nonprofit marketing organization.  How did they have $4.5 million to throw to Super Bowl ad? Bruce.</p><p>TURKEL:  Well, they probably aren't going to sell an awful lot of avocados.  And remember, they're not only trying to get consumers to buy them. This  goes to the distribution chain. They want the buyers, the whole sellers,  the grocery managers to know about Mexican avocados. California has owned  that product. Now Mexico is looking for their opportunity. As far as the  money goes, I guess they sell a lot of avocados.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, they're supposed to be a non-profit -- this group from  Mexico. And then, it seems a little.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Because they spend all their money on that.</p><p>TURKEL:  Like the NFL.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's right. We've got to go. Thanks, guys. All right. The past  is in the past, unless you are into politics. An unflattering profile of  Jeb Bush could shake things up for the GOP frontman.</p><p>And Kanye West might be the only person in the world who isn't happy at a  waffle house. Look at how miserable he looks. I guess greasy breakfast  carbs smothered in butter and whip cream aren't his thing. At the end of  the day, it's all about money and waffles, as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Big tech  company is quietly acting to save their advertising revenues. Report say  that Google and Microsoft have been painting off a German ad blocker which  stop ads from showing on the website. Blocking technology could be seen as  a threat to the whole online ad industry -- Yeah, I bet -- which is worth  as much as $120 billion.</p><p>Manufacturing fell more than expected last month to a reading of 53.5.  Anything above 50 is good but the index has now weakened for the third  straight month not a positive sign for the economy.</p><p>And Apple stores will now have safes to protect its new line of smart  watches. Gold Apple watches will retail for thousands of dollars. But keep  them top the way in the back. That's the latest from the Fox Business  Network giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  President Obama rolling out his new $4 trillion budget proposal  for 2016. The plan includes increased taxes on capital gains and a  controversial corporate tax reform. Our own Peter Barnes is at the White  House with more. Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINTON CORRESPONDENT:  Well,  let me reiterate the highlights of this drilling down into the $4 trillion.  The president wants to spend $1.1 trillion in discretionary spending. That  would be a 7 percent increase from the current fiscal year, about $75  billion in additional spending split evenly -- about evenly between the  Defense Department and non-defense programs. And he wants to blow through  the sequester of 2011.</p><p>He is also looking at more than trillion dollars in tax increases on higher  income families raising capital gains tax rates, by applying it to  inheritances, to raising the state taxes, by limiting tax deductions for  wealthier families. He proposes nearly $500,000 million in new spending on  infrastructure and highway and bridges. A tax most of that financed with  that financed with a new 14 percent on repatriated profits of U.S.  companies overseas. The Republicans say this is all a dead on arrival. And  they are going to be proposing their own budget. Melissa, back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So things just as usual. Perfect. Peter, thank you so much.</p><p>BARNES:  You bet.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, getting some major love from  the Hawkeye State. A new poll from the Des Moines register shows walker  leading the way with likely Iowa caucus voters at 15 percent. Senator Rand  Paul right on his heels with 14 percent. It is worth noting that this poll  was done before Mitt Romney called it quits. Todd Starnes and John Lonski  are back to discuss this. Todd, what do you think is this surprising to you  that Scott was -- kind of his neck on the woods?</p><p>STARNES:  You know, it is his neck of the woods. But when you really step  back and look at Scott walker and his story and what he's able to  accomplish in Wisconsin, this guy really could be a contender. So I'm  excited to see how he does as more people get to know his story and what he  did in Wisconsin.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, John, what do you think its economics would mean for the  country?</p><p>LONSKI:  Well, I think his performance in Wisconsin has been excellent from  the viewpoint of the markets.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  Right now, it cost only $32 to insure $10,000 worth of Wisconsin  government debt. In neighboring Illinois, that premium is over $190. He's  done a great job. And this is a difficult.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So that's a wonderful point. So explaining to our audience what  that means is that he is more credit worthy because of what he has done in  the state and how.</p><p>LONSKI:  Precisely.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . he tights the budget.</p><p>LONSKI:  He knows how to run a government and how to control the budget.  And that's something I think a lot of Americans very much want from  Washington.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And nobody in Washington seems to know how to do it all. So he  could really bring that math to D.C. That's a good point. All right.  Meanwhile, a non-flattering profile of Jeb Bush testing the theory that all  press is good press. The \"Boston Globe\" publishing a lengthy write-up on  Bush's prep school years with classmates alleging that Bush was a heavy pot  smoker and at times he was even a bully which if you have kids right now,  you know, that's the worst thing that you could say about a child right  now, that they are a bully. I mean that's like one of the big things.</p><p>STARNES:  You know, I had a chance to read this piece in the \"Boston  Globe\", Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Did you? Yeah.</p><p>STARNES:  It's not like he was sitting in his dorm room listening to, you  know, barbata rock (ph) and smoking crack. You know, the guy was smoking  pot. And maybe he pushed around a couple kids every now and again. They  said he was the tallest kid in campus. So he was a little bit of imposing  figure.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>STARNES:  . but look, they did the same thing with Mitt Romney. The thing  that gets me is the double standard here. The mainstream media go after the  Republicans but they give the Democrats a pass.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Well, I mean he was in high school.</p><p>LONSKI:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm so glad I didn't do anything bad in high school. I mean,  right.</p><p>LONSKI:  Neither did I, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  But the reality is I'd be a hypocrite if I stated that. So we're  all hypocrites. You know, we all tell our children not to make the mistakes  we made.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>LONSKI:  But that does not make us hypocrites.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. No. That's amazing. Meanwhile, the governor Chris Christie  meeting with British prime minister David Cameron in London today. The rest  of the country, though, they had no idea who he was. A 63-year-old nurse  summing up her feelings for Christie by saying, quote, \"I enjoyed American  politics, but I've never heard of him.\" She says she enjoys American  politics like, \"They're amusing from afar -- those American politics.\" You  know, it (inaudible) you guys are idiots but I do not know who this joker  is. Like that's basically she said. What do you think, John?</p><p>LONSKI:  Well, You know, it's not surprising. They don't know who he is  because he hasn't done that great of a job controlling New Jersey's budget,  you know, what I referred to earlier.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't think they have a clue about New Jersey's budget.</p><p>LONSKI:  Well, why.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know local politicians.</p><p>LONSKI:  He can't take care of his own house.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>LONSKI:  I mean why should you care about him on the global stage?</p><p>STARNES:  Yeah. I mean here, he is an anomaly because he hollers at people  he doesn't like. They do that all the time.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That is right.</p><p>STARNES:  So that's a few things but.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's right. If you watch the House of Parliament get together  and they're all screaming at each other.</p><p>STARNES:  They wear haltered wig. That's what I want to know.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes. I don't know.</p><p>STARNES:  How he might go to look with it (ph)?</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know. He's trying to look like he has international  experience or he can -- and everybody's like. \"Who is this guy?\"</p><p>STARNES:  International mystery.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right. He didn't wear the red sweater so that counts for  something. Thanks, guys. Heading in to the last hour of trading, let's  check in with Liz Claman and see what she's got coming up with her program.  Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, COUNTDOWN HOST:  Well, you just were talking about the Super  Bowl commercials, which ones hit it, which ones didn't. Who won the social  media show? How about that? Who stole that show? Was it Facebook or  Twitter? There is a huge discrepancy, trust me, between the two numbers.  Wait until you hear who comes out on top.</p><p>And on top of that, these two experts that we have coming in are going to  talk about who stole the actual commercial show. And they are experts.  Netbase Aggregates -- a lot of the data. Peter Caswell, their smarty pants  guy, he actually has some hard data on who might have won the commercials  in here.</p><p>And Lance Ulanoff, Mashable's editor-at-large is very opinionated. And he  has a very good sense of the winners there.</p><p>And college students, Melissa, you know they're in the prime of their life.  At least, Amazon Prime thinks they are. They are striking deals with  universities now to make sure that college kids have the most robin as they  need overnight. Yes, Amazon Prime hooking up with all kinds of universities  and colleges to grab the college dollars. They need the student body money,  Melissa.</p><p>Is this going to be big? Well, Ripley MacDonald of Amazon thinks so. He's  the direct or of student programs. That plus the S&amp;P hits a 2015 low. So  we're going to be looking at the markets and asking this question of our  traders. Time to go to cash? Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Liz, sounds like a great show. I can't wait.</p><p>CLAMAN:  OK.</p><p>FRANCIS:  The Super Bowl going head to head with Hollywood. \"American  Sniper\" is still raking in the dough. </p><p>Plus, the Super Bowl hang over. Hopefully, you didn't called out sick today  because if you did, you are not alone and we're all very suspicious. You  can never have too much money.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's who's making  and losing money today -- anyone with a piece of Shake Shack. The stock  hitting a new low after more than doubling during it's debut last week.  That is not so great news for founder Danny Meyer who has more than 7  million shares meaning he lost $9 million since waking up. At least he has  delicious burgers to make him feel better. We went to Shake Shack this  weekend, it was awesome.</p><p>Plus, working at the Super Bowl -- Missy Elliott. Spotify reporting a  streaming increase for the rapper. Her songs are up nearly 700 percent  after the game. Missy's hit song, \"Lose Control\" is up more than 1300  percent.</p><p>Headliner, Katy Perry seeing an overall increase around 85 percent for her  music. And \"American Sniper\" tops the Box Office again. The Clint Eastwood  film raking in more than $30 million this weekend. That brings to the total  gross of nearly $250 million. Wow. They're doing well with that one.</p><p>Now, for a little fun with spare change. If you are watching this show from  your couch at home, you are not alone. Nearly, 1.5 million Americans are  calling out sick today. We're not buying it. Bruce is back with me.</p><p>So Bruce, I love this. It is the most common day of the year to call in  sick because it is the first Monday in February. People love to call on  sick on Mondays because it just makes sense your week is not quite over.  It's the dead of winter. We have a storm going on here on the northeast.  And it's the day it's the day after the Super Bowl. In my book, anyone who  called in sick today, I'm sorry, looks completely bogus. You're better off  coming in to work vomiting on someone and going home, right?</p><p>TURKEL:  Absolutely. That was my dad saying, \"Anybody who calls in sick on  Monday is not sick.\" We had two in our office but they had good excuses.  Allison had a baby on Friday. Roberto is injury duty. So my office is cool.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>TURKEL:  I think the rest of them, yeah, it's kind of bogus.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's a little bogus.1.5 million people are expected to call in  sick today. 4.4 million arrived late.</p><p>TURKEL:  And hung over.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And hung over because the Super Bowl was awesome and you had to  watch it to the end. Some good excuses that we've heard along the way. My  uniform caught fire when I put it in the microwave to dry. I like that one.  I accidentally got on a plane. Yup, me too. That's a good one.</p><p>TURKEL:  The (inaudible) allows that everyday.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, right. Exactly. What are some good ones that you've heard,  Bruce?</p><p>TURKEL:  The best ones I've heard is the people who call up and try to  sound sick and they're talking, \"You know, I can't come in.\" You don't  sound sick. And you're trying so hard.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL:  . to sound sick. But you know, if you stayed out and had a lot to  drink, you woke up a little green and it's my office -- stay away. I don't  like your idea of coming in and throwing up on my desk. I can do it without  them.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. I don't know. I mean just for myself, if you don't want to  want to look like you're calling out and it's not true.</p><p>TURKEL:  Prove it.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . have you ever called in sick on Super Bowl Monday? Bruce, you  strike me as someone who would never call in sick no matter what.</p><p>TURKEL:  Never. Never.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No?</p><p>TURKEL:  Absolutely not.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Maybe the NFL should move the game to Saturday night.</p><p>TURKEL:  Well, I think they figured out when they can get the highest  viewership. Remember, Saturday night is a profitable night for a lot of  reasons. Sunday night is not. And so, they show up on Sunday. They get the  highest ratings of any show in history. I think they figured out that  right. And by the way, the NFL does not care if your employees don't show  up for work the next day.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No. They definitely -- I mean they focus at the victory because  you're at home watching television.</p><p>TURKEL:  Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So you could be watching other NFL shows, NFL network. I mean  it's a win-win all the way around. Bruce Turkel, thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL:  Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So we ask what crazy excuses you've heard for not coming in to  work. And you guys didn't disappoint us. On Facebook, Stephanie writes,  \"Once I said my cat was sick because I wanted to enjoy the freakish plenty  fall Seattle day in my new sports car.\"</p><p>And Andy tweets, \"I dreamed I was fired so I stayed home.\" That was an  excuse that he used. Jonathan says, \"I didn't use this myself.\" Sure,  Jonathan. \"But a coworker once used, my hair hurts.\" I loved that one.  That's somebody who wants to be fired. My hair hurts.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @melissaafrancis or like me on  facebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox. If you follow me on Twitter could really  fun especially when something bad happens at a restaurant. I'm just saying.</p><p>They may be beautiful, but they're certainly not rich. Young people finally  get proved that mom and dad had it easier. So maybe a little help with that  cellphone bill isn't out of the question. At the end of the day, it's all  about money -- money and Monday.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Celebrities they are just like us. The night before John Legend's  super model wife, Chrissy Teigen joined Kim and Kanye West for a quality  dinner. Check it out. The foursome hit up a nearby waffle house where Kanye  West reported sought (ph) for the entire meal. Like that's really a  surprise. So you think he's more of a pancakes or scrambled eggs kind of  guy? Why would you not want to go to waffle house for dinner? He's so  pouty.</p><p>All right. Crashing student debts. Now, that millennials are making $2,000  less than their parents did at their age, recently released senses data  reveals that young people basically everywhere except on the east coast and  had seen their earnings drop since 1980. James and John are back with us.  Not really surprised but depressing nonetheless. James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It is depressing. I think it goes back to the story that started  your broadcast, which is you cannot go after investment and business income  because that is the money that funds technology and equipment, which is  what allows people to make more money. So if you want these kids to have  more salaries, you've to allow businesses to put the technology into the  workplace that will justify those higher salaries.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  You've got to be careful not to over regulate the economy because  the reality today is that these young people will be facing every  increasing competition from the skilled and always cheaper workforce of  emerging market countries.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. And I mean if you look at this as a parent who has no  control over those kind of things other than your vote which you have --  but it can be so frustrating to watch our politicians screw things up --  what my takeaway from this is I got to stir my kids towards the jobs where  they can actually make money more than ever. You know, look out in the  future and -- they got to learn to code and they've got to get out there  and do the things that are going to help them because kids are falling  behind right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you want skills that can give them a lot of options. But I  think the problem right now it's policy and yes, part of it is K-12  education. But the big part is we're not seeing business creation because  we don't have an environment that lets people grow without taxation and  regulation. And that really is a -- it's the irony of the Obama era. All  the people that he talks about helping.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . have had terrible time since he was elected.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right, John? Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI:  He's exactly right. That's a sad story because it's actually the  lower classes that have feared the worst over the last eight years or so.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah. Absolutely. All right, gentlemen. Thanks to both of you. I  wanted to show you something fun before we go. Bruce Turkel sent this to me  when we were doing our Super Bowl segment. Take a look that. That's Katy  Perry in her costume from last night. Right next to her that's Will Ferrell  from \"Blades of Glory\".</p><p>I think Katy may have borrowed the costume. What do you think, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yeah. It's a classic. I mean not quite on the level (inaudible)  but it certainly.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . a nommage at the Super Bowl.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Fabulous. I know. John, you want to get in there?</p><p>LONSKI:  In this side of economy, you got to be much more creative.  (inaudible)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I love it. Pretty facts. Economics no matter what. My head is off  to you, John Lonski. Thank you. That's all the money we have for you.  Here's Liz.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2015 Fox News Network, LLC.

He's going to add $6 trillion to our national debt. Perfect. And guess who'll be paying that off -- young people in this country. More burdened ever before, they are making thousands less than their parents did decades ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And speaking of big budgets? How about the price tags of those Super Bowl ads? Most of that money spent depressing us. We're going to dig into that one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And good luck getting back from the big game. Dangerous weather in some parts of the country causing travel chaos everywhere. Because even when they say it's not, it's always about money.</p><p>The $4 trillion budget. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>unveiling his proposal earlier today, saying the country can afford the hefty price tag.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PRES. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Since I took office we have cut our deficits by about two-thirds. That's the fastest period of sustained deficit reduction since after the demobilization at the end of World War II. So we can afford to make these invests while remaining fiscally responsible.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: It's interesting considering the White House expects it to add nearly $6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.</p><p>Let's bring in today's panel. James Freeman of -- from the \"Wall Street Journal\". Todd Starnes is from Fox News Radio. John Lonski is here as well from Moody's. You're their chief economist. All you take the crack out of it. Can we afford this -- no problem?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, MOODY'S CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, maybe you can afford it today but if you look forward at the funding demands from the retirement of a -- forthcoming retirement of Baby Boomers, a pressure being placed on Medicare along with us, the unknown costs of the Affordable Care Act -- never mind the possibility of another recession -- no, you cannot afford it longer term.</p><p>FRANCIS: James, I don't even think we can afford it today.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ASSISTANT EDITOR: Yeah. And just to be clear, the -- this White House math you need to translate a little. When he's saying.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, please.</p><p>FREEMAN: . we've done a great job.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, please.</p><p>FREEMAN: . of deficit reduction, historic, what he leaves out that first year of '09 with the stimulus was highest deficit since World War II. So the fact that he gave.</p><p>FRANCIS: He's using that as base..</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. He gave us four straight years of trillion plus deficits. And now that it's gone down to 500,000 million.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . in any other time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Would be horrible?</p><p>FREEMAN: . would be considered horrible and irresponsible.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . he is taking credit for the reduction. But no entitlement reform in this budget.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: So when we talk about future problems, no effort to fix them along with all the spending.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. And, Todd, you know, he's talking about taxing U.S. companies on overseas profits saying they should be paying their fair share. I love it when we say things like that. We're one of only countries in the world that wants to do something like this -- tax companies on their overseas profits. So it's basically unheard of around the globe.</p><p>TODD STARNES, FOX NEWS &amp; COMMENTARY HOST: That's right. And you'll hear this president also say that he wants to look after the middle class. Well, middle class incomes under this president have gone down $4,000 annually. This is a very, very troubling time for American families.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: And quite frankly, I don't any anybody is looking out for the working man in America.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Meanwhile, \"Ale to the chief\", NBC asking the really tough questions during the Super Bowl interview with <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: We make beer -- first president since George Washington to make some booze in the White House. Let's taste it.</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC NEWS ANCHOR: Right. Well, I'll let.</p><p>OBAMA: It's been well-reviewed.</p><p>GUTHRIE: . football or basketball?</p><p>OBAMA: I'm still a basketball guy but I love football.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Offense or defense?</p><p>OBAMA: Always offense.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Wings or chips and guac?</p><p>OBAMA: Now, that's tough. You know, I'm going chips and guac. I'm a fanatic about guac.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?</p><p>OBAMA: Love them both.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STARNES: Oh, Geezle (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow. I mean it makes GloZell look hard-hitting. Right? I mean doesn't it make you hunger for the green lipstick again? I mean, she really -- wow. Yeah. Impressed, Todd?</p><p>STARNES: OK. For the record here, let's do some history. And the president seems to thinks we still have 57 states. President Washington did not live in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>STARNES: . the White House. So Mr. President, let's do some history there -- history research. Here is the issue I have. Aside from the fact that you're right, GloZell asked a more hard-hitting questions than Savannah Guthrie did, the bigger issue here is the president and the image he conveys here. He is hoisting and zipping a glass of organic honey ale.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>STARNES: . with pinky finger extended.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: What kind of message does that send our enemies?</p><p>FRANCIS: James, don't you do that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Not.</p><p>FRANCIS: No?</p><p>FREEMAN: . well, you just kind of knew it was going to be a pumpkin or honey flavored ale.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . but the.</p><p>FRANCIS: You should have that feeling.</p><p>FREEMAN: .. talking about broadcast history, back when Fox had the game last year, you had O'Reilly asking about the IRS.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . asking him about the rollout of the health care website. So, yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not.</p><p>FREEMAN: . big contrast in the journalistic coverage.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not guac versus wings? You don't think that is presidential, John?</p><p>LONSKI: This is a great example of not wasting your time watching pre-game shows.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: . it's a perfect example of it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely.</p><p>STARNES: Can I ask you this though?</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: Did anyone else notice that Savannah Guthrie, the female anchor - - they decided to do interview in a kitchen? I mean what sort of optics does send this whole war on women?</p><p>FRANCIS: There you go. I love it. All right. And ratings record for the Super Bowl -- not that interview, but for the Super Bowl itself. The dramatic finish helping the event score the highest overnight rating in history -- up 4 percent from last year. So if you leaped through that interview at beginning -- and I got to tell you I didn't even watch it, I watched parts of it later all I could stomach -- but the game was phenomenal. James. What did you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: You loved the game?</p><p>FREEMAN: Until the end.</p><p>FRANCIS: I saw you in the hallway. You looked a little bitter.</p><p>FREEMAN: Absolutely. And I'm still bitter. I.</p><p>FRANCIS: I feel like you're a Seahawks guy.</p><p>FREEMAN: . this is a team -- this is basically the greatest team in the last 15 years, now, caught twice breaking the rules. And you could argue about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Come on.</p><p>FREEMAN: . intent. You can argue about who was it? Was it the equipment guy or whatever? But I don't think that's.</p><p>FRANCIS: The lone wolf ball boy in the bathroom.</p><p>STARNES: By the way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>STARNES: . on plus side, did you see.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>STARNES: . Katy Perry straddling the mechanical lion there? Did you catch the nuance on field? She was parading through a field of inflated balls.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wow. John Lonski.</p><p>STARNES: I don't know what that means.</p><p>FRANCIS: . you want to come out and try to top that joke?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I can't top that one but you have to admit, the Patriots denied everything -- any wrongdoing. They had no knowledge of it.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. So you're counting them a break. You think that -- and you're totally ignoring inflated balls coming?</p><p>LONSKI: The eye of the tiger.</p><p>FREEMAN: No one disputes the inflation of the balls were.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. All right.</p><p>STARNES: Either fireworks otherwise.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's do something serious here. Oil staging a rally, currently up for the third day in a row. That is shockingly crude's longest winning streak more than five months. John, I feel you'll be on solid ground with this one -- for oil.</p><p>LONSKI: Yeah. Production.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: . production are showing their.</p><p>FRANCIS: There you go.</p><p>LONSKI: . back on prices. You've really cut back on rig count in the United States -- down 20 percent to 30 percent. Capital spending by oil companies is dropping.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: So it follows that oil prices begin to move higher.</p><p>FRANCIS: A lot of people talking about these strikes that are going on at refineries around the country. And that -- I mean it's surprising to see crude rally in the face of that because normally, it would mean there'd be less demand for crude oil. So crude would fall, if refineries are on strike. It could be bad news for consumers, right, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah. I think John is solid on every topic for the record.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. That's right. Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: But we, you know, we could see price rises here. You would talk about some reduction in drilling in North America. And of course if strikes threaten production, that's going to make the price go up.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. This is a big story. Tale of two groundhogs today. Punxsutawney Phil seeing a shadow this morning seeing six more weeks of winter. But the groundhog of record in my book is Staten Island Chuck, he is predicting the end of winter. Although, we don't know who that really is because of course Mayor de Blasio killed Staten Island Chuck last year when he dropped him on his head. It turns out that wasn't even Staten Island Chuck, it was his sister Charlotte that, you know, capped last year in the middle of this whole thing.</p><p>And here we go. We're going to see it. This is where he killed it. So the groundhog died later that night. So the new replacement this year was safely in a glass box to make sure that it didn't get killed by the mayor which was really smart move. I would hide in a glass box as well.</p><p>STARNES: Now, my groundhog is General Beauregard Lee in the Southern States of Atlanta.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm sorry, who?</p><p>STARNES: General Beauregard Lee. Are you not familiar with this?</p><p>FRANCIS: No.</p><p>STARNES: Everybody below the Mason-Dixon Line.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>STARNES: . looks to General Lee to determine weather. And he sided with Staten Island Chuck there.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really?</p><p>STARNES: So you got the Yankees and the southerners.</p><p>FRANCIS: You think it is over?</p><p>STARNES: I think so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Is he afraid of Mayor de Blasio? Does he know about the murder that happened last year?</p><p>STARNES: I think he does but, you know, as -- the ground hogs are known as yellow-bellied marmots, not biblical sense of the word but that's what they're officially called. And.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are you just making this up?</p><p>STARNES: No, I'm not making this up, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're just making this up?</p><p>STARNES: Melissa, I am not making this up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Who is this guy? What? Do you want to try to weigh in there?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I would just say Phil has never been afraid to go against the grain on his picks.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's true.</p><p>FREEMAN: So I like it when he's out there with a bold call.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think you're right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Which yellow-belly marmot are you on the side of, John?</p><p>LONSKI: Traditionalists. Punxsutawney Phil without a doubt. But I'm still confused.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm completely.</p><p>LONSKI: Does he see a shadow or doesn't see a shadow?</p><p>FRANCIS: . confused. I don't know. Everything Todd said confused me. And I love it. All right. Thanks, guys. Better grab those shovels.</p><p>STARNES: I'm honored.</p><p>FRANCIS: More snow is on the way, just in time to ruin your Monday.</p><p>Plus, getting under your skin, the new technology that is opening doors for workers. More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nothing snaps you out of Super Bowl haze like being stuck in an airport in middle of a snowstorm. Wicked weather across the northeast leaving thousands of travelers stranded. Fox News' Rick Leventhal in LaGuardia Airport, New York. But first, let's go to Fox Business' Jeff Flock. He is all bundled up in Indiana. Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I get all the good time stuff, Melissa. Snow -- big snow -- last time I talked to you, maybe it was the cold, although it's not so warm now. We had blizzard conditions across much of the Midwest over the weekend. And you can see what it has brought. Take a look at all the snow out here.</p><p>Chicago had its largest -- fifth largest snowfall in a 24-hour period in this recorded history. And this is the Lake Michigan lakefront out here. Maybe, you see it. It looks a little bit more like Alaska. A lot of snow fell.</p><p>Fortunately, it has just now, within the last two hours moved off the lake effect snow that we had out here. And it is now back to, well, almost a little bit of sun peeking through. But a lot of snow left. About 18 inches in Chicago alone -- a lot of drifts, even higher than that. Good times in the Midwest, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Thank you so much. Rick, how does it look at the airport?</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: It's pretty crowded with people trying to find assistance. These lines behind us are not for flight. They're for customer assistance for American Airlines. LaGuardia among the worst nationwide with 604 flights canceled today alone that were scheduled in or out. The number nationwide, much larger -- 3500 coast to coast. And if you add in yesterday and tomorrow, it's more than 5,000 flights.</p><p>We could show you the board here. You see a lot of red up there -- all those canceled flights. Those are arrivals. So if they don't arrive they can't load them up to send them back out again.</p><p>Newark is also bad. Almost 600 flights canceled there. JFK, 140 flights canceled in or out. And the weather outside is pretty bad. It's snowing. There's been a mix of sleet and freezing rain all day. And the conditions are expected to stay bad through tonight.</p><p>And of course, this ripple effect is extending across the country including to Arizona where some 80,000 people were trying to get home from the Super Bowl. That's double the normal traffic at Sky Harbor International making it the busiest day at that airport ever. Hundreds of flights canceled or delayed last night. It's a bit better today -- 27 cancellations, 38 delays.</p><p>But, Melissa, there are worst places to be stuck in Phoenix, where it's 74 and sunny today. Again, it's snowing pretty hard in New York. And it should be bad through tonight. Cancellations and delays are going to continue at least through tomorrow.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rick Leventhal, thank you so much. Thanks to both of you. Get back inside, Jeff. Go back inside. Poor guy.</p><p>All right. ExxonMobil leading energy stocks higher today. Let's go to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for more on that one. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Melissa. Tell Jeff not to freeze any longer than he needs to. Right now, we're looking at oil at $49.23. So oil is gaining for the third day in a row. We haven't seen that since August. And with that energy shares are doing quite well, Melissa. So names such as Exxon and Chevron had been leading the way on Dow Jones Industrial Average. Some of the other big movers including Transocean and Apache have been great reformers.</p><p>It would be interesting to see how with the strike we've been seeing with the United Steelworkers Union and the like, how that may affect gasoline prices on the rise as well. So there is certainly a lot all intertwined together. But energy a bright spot here on Wall Street. Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Nicole, thank you so much. A few stories on our radar right now. Netflix is raising a billion dollars as it fights to keep the top spot in the video streaming market. Part of the debt will fund deals for content and potential acquisitions.</p><p>And in D.C. a would-be White House intruder is in custody after trying to scale a bike rack. The temporary bike rack was in front of the main fence but the man didn't even get that far before secret service agents arrested him.</p><p>Well, it is Super Bowl Monday. Haven't you heard nearly 1.5 million people are calling out sick today -- the day after the Super Bowl. I want to hear from you. What are the craziest excuses for skipping work? Maybe you've used them yourself. Maybe you've heard them. Follow me on Twitter @melissaafrancis or like me on facebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox. We're going to read some of them later.</p><p>All right. The new warnings from the CDC as measles cases climb to highs not seen in decades. What you need to know about the controversy at the heart of it.</p><p>Plus, young, beautiful, oh, so broke. Why you did have it easier than your kids do now. More \"Money\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have some breaking news right now. Source's telling the \"Wall Street Journal\" that Verizon is close to selling assets that include cellphone towers and part of its wireless business. The group of deals is said to bring in more than $10 billion and could be announced as soon as later this week. We're going to stay on top of that story. You could see the stock there is up just slightly right now.</p><p>From the U.S. to every corner of the globe, money is flying around the world today, starting in Spain where thousands of people took to the streets for anti-austerity protests. Some people there are so angry at high unemployment and budget cuts that they're now supporting a radical leftist party. Sound a little like Greece.</p><p>Over to Croatia where the government wants to pay off the debt of its poorest citizens. Around 60,000 people will be given a fresh start. Those eligible have debt under $5,000 and they have no savings or property at all.</p><p>And landing in Sweden where one company is putting microchips in their employees. The chip gives them access to different services, locations within the buildings. You even need it to use the photocopy machine of the company insists that it's completely ethical and the chip is no bigger than a grain of sand. Nothing scary about that.</p><p>All right. The Center for Disease Control issuing a grave warning over the spread of measles saying we could be on the verge of, quote,\"a large outbreak around the country\". Already at least 102 cases have been reported in 14 states. More than half of those, linked to the cluster at California's Disneyland.</p><p>Here now to discuss it is Dr. Devi. She is an assistant professor at the NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Devi, break this down for me. How dangerous is this for folks out there? Are you safe if you've had your shot?</p><p>DEVI NAMPIAPARAMPIL, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ASSISTANT PROFESSOR: You're not totally safe with the shot but, you know, that's the best option that you have. So generally speaking the measles vaccine is pretty effective. But the problem is, there are some people that don't get the measles vaccine, right? And there are people, let's say age one or under, babies that are too young to get the shot. So they are always at risk.</p><p>Now, you also have some folks who are older. Let's say they have some problem with their immune system, whether cancer, HIV, diabetes. They might have had vaccine but they're still a little bit of risk.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. So everybody, in the newspapers, everybody -- this is huge in the media. They're blaming it on this trend in parents who are not getting their kid vaccinated because they believe it leads to other problems. Is it fair to blame this outbreak on folks who are not getting vaccinated?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Well, I wouldn't blame them. But there's a combination of factors. So in other countries for example, people aren't required always to get the vaccine. So you have foreign visitors who come here who might have had measles. And they can spread it to other folks.</p><p>Now, at Disneyland that's an international destination. So that's why it probably started there but the fact that it took hold in California probably is related to those folks who.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: . opted out of the vaccine.</p><p>FRANCIS: And let me ask you before you go. You know, Parents say that they have the right to decide whether or not their kids are going to have these vaccines. There are certain schools you can't send your kids to unless you have the vaccine back and forth. For parents who don't want to do it, is the science on their side, Dr. Devi?</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: The science is not on their side actually. I mean I think most people aren't really opting out because they're concerned about let's say autism or these other things. The science is against all that. They opt out sometimes because they think, \"Measles was eradicated.\" They really need to get another shot for their kid so they have these other issues.</p><p>But the thing is, even though measles was technically eradicated in 2000 it is back now. So when they choose.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: . not to get the vaccine, they're actually not only putting themselves at risk for the kids but putting people around them, even if they had vaccine people could still be at risk.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dr. Devi, thank you so much. Appreciate your time.</p><p>NAMPIAPARAMPIL: Nice seeing you.</p><p>FRANCIS: The measles outbreak giving rise to clash between the White House and the GOP governor. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>emphatically stating that you should get your kids vaccinated. Meanwhile, New Jersey governor <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>should quote, \"make room\", for quote, \"balance for parental choice\".</p><p>James Freeman and Todd Starnes are back with us. So and -- I mean as soon as the politicians start weighing in, you know, it's become a big issue. It's interesting that Governor <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>says, you know that he wants to balance with parental choice. Where does -- Todd, I'll let you go first. Where does that position him?</p><p>STARNES: Well, now, at the Governor's Office, they're walking those statements back.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are they?</p><p>STARNES: . through it again. I think that this goes to the heart of the issue with people like <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>among Conservatives and the Republican Party. They're concerned that Governor Christie wants to take rights away from mom an dad and give them to big government. And that is a growing concern in this country.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: So he is coming out saying exactly opposite to make sure people understand he is saying it.</p><p>STARNES: That's right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead. What were you going to say?</p><p>FREEMAN: The president is right. This is not issue of big government. This is basic social responsibility. I mean this -- the measles are much more contagious than the flu. And we did talk with Dr. Devi, but before we had vaccines, hundreds of people died every year. You can add to that list polio, all of these other diseases that we think of is eradicated.</p><p>If people stop vaccinating, they're coming back. They're going to be deadly. There is no scientific argument not to vaccinate. So, I wish Christie had been stronger when the question came up. It's good if he's now walked back, and said, \"No, you ought to vaccinate.\"</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Thanks, guys. McDonald's uses it's Super Bowl ad to bring families closer but based on social media response maybe they should stick to making fries.</p><p>Plus, all those nachos and six-packs seemed like a great idea last night, didn't they? But today you're another victim of Super Bowl Flu. It is the most popular day of the year to miss at work. And we're bringing you all the lamest excuses. Did you sick out today? Are you watching from home? Smart Money coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: In case you did not see it, the Patriots are the new Super Bowl champs after a very questionable throw failed to seal the deal for the Seahawks. But Seattle didn't just lose the title to New England, losing them on the field they also lost out on a big financial boost. Rich Edson has been crunching all those numbers for us. Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, Melissa, especially in valuation, winning teams build a better brand. They can charge more for tickets, merchandise, and ad space.</p><p>Some financial experts we spoke with say, \"The patriots can expect a bump in franchise value because of this win about 10 percent to 15 percent from this year to next.\" That's considerable. As Forbes said, the team is worth more than $2.5 billion second most valuable franchising in the NFL next to the Dallas Cowboys.</p><p>Last year after winning the Super Bowl, Forbes put the Seahawks value at nearly 25 percent more than the previous season though that growth was inline with league wide valuation increases. And one sales expert says the Patriots as an established franchise can easily capitalize on this when more so than an expected champion from a smaller city.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAM CAUCCI, SALES HUDDLE GROUP CEO: The smaller market teams have to get a lot more dynamic and creative with the way they move tickets after winning a Super Bowl. Usually, you see a team go anywhere between eight and 10 percent up in overall ticket pricing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: As for the Patriots, he predicts more dynamic sponsorship offers higher revenue from stadium sweets and more advertising for companies looking to align with the winning brand. Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rich, thank you so much. So we laughed, we cried, we cringed. The Patriots maybe taking home the trophy but there are plenty of other winners and losers from the big game last night.</p><p>Joining me now, Bruce Turkel, CEO of Turkel Brands. James Freeman is back as well. Bruce, let's dig right in. What was the deal with the nationwide dead kid ad? Everybody is talking about it today. I was watching it live on my couch.</p><p>And he's speaking in, you know, I won't be able to do this and that that everybody on my couch mouth dropped wide open. I said, \"This kid's dead. They're going to tell us he's dead.\" Sure enough they did, and we're like Nationwide. So what are they trying to tell us? That we should insure against this so at least you make money when your kid dies? I mean, Bruce, help me. What was the idea behind this?</p><p>BRUCE TURKEL, TURKEL BRANDS CEO: I got to tell you, Melissa, I don't understand that either. Nationwide decided to be the buzz kill of the Super Bowl. This morning I heard someone talking about Obama's budget. And he said, the budget went over like Nationwide's top ad. I mean it's already part of the nomenclature that if you want to be a downer -- you want to be Debbie Downer, you're going to be.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: . with Nationwide.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. Yeah. No. I mean it was (inaudible) and when he says, \"Because I died, my four year old looked up and went, what?\"</p><p>TURKEL: No. I know, it's awful.</p><p>FRANCIS: Oh my gosh. Yeah. You manage to scare my children are in the Super Bowl. Thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL: And how.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL: How insensitive to parents who have lost children. Imagine sitting down to watch the game.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL: . and that's what they confront you with.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: Crazy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. OK. Let's move on to McDonald's. Their pay with love ad. I'm not so sure that was so great. So people come up to the register and you sit there and you -- and they give you your bill and they say, \"You know, what you have to do is call your mother and tell her you love her or whatever it was.\"</p><p>So one of our crack comedy writers on our staff sent out a tweet that said, \"If McDonald's asked me to dance for my food, I'm storming out and going to Wendy's.\"</p><p>So just to compound their error, McDonald's responded to our producer and said. \"Hi, Erin. If you're chosen to participate in Pay in With Love, we have other options if you don't feel comfortable.\" Like their after defending it. And she -- and they said, \"We want this to be fun.\" I mean they sounded like my eight grade Religion teacher. James, what did you think of this one?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, this is a -- you're tough graders.</p><p>FRANCIS: You like this?</p><p>FREEMAN: I didn't think the Nationwide's that bad.</p><p>FRANCIS: What?</p><p>FREEMAN: And as far as McDonald's, Goofy, you know, definitely trying to hard to be adorable. But I think it brought a smile to most of the people in the room I was watching it with. Great. And a lot of people thought it was not really on target. But I wouldn't say it was one of the worst.</p><p>FRANCIS: You weren't bothered by Nationwide, James? You're the first person. You weren't.</p><p>FREEMAN: No.</p><p>FRANCIS: . you're not bothered by Nationwide.</p><p>FREEMAN: I thought it was -- I see what you mean maybe insensitive to people who had suffered some loss. But I thought it was a compelling story. And at the end, it made a good point. And by the way, childhood accidents.</p><p>FRANCIS: Stop. Stop. Stop.</p><p>FREEMAN: . if you want to go after things, football would be last on your list.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. I -- all right, Bruce. Just tell me what you think of McDonald's.</p><p>TURKEL: Well, I'm curious why they didn't partner with \"Superbad\" and they could have Nick Robin (ph). I just got to figure, if you're going to have someone pay with loving, what could go wrong with that. I can't even begin to imagine. Think about all the people that who're going to call their mother and then start arguing. And of course, \"They haven't been to visit.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: . you don't come to see me, but now, you get a free hamburger. Now, you call me?\"</p><p>FRANCIS: I love it. No. That's good stuff. Before we run out of time, I want to talk about one that I like because I'm being so mean. I loved the avocados ad. That was really funny when they're drafting, you know, all the countries are drafting. There was like a polar bear that was hoping for -- I don't know -- what was it like? Australia.</p><p>TURKEL: Mexico.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mexico. Yes, something with beaches, you know, whatever.</p><p>TURKEL: Yes, it had the sombrero (ph).</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. It was something from Mexico. Instead, they've draft the avocado which I thought was hysterical. The only thing is, how is -- I mean Avocados from Mexico is supposed to be a nonprofit marketing organization. How did they have $4.5 million to throw to Super Bowl ad? Bruce.</p><p>TURKEL: Well, they probably aren't going to sell an awful lot of avocados. And remember, they're not only trying to get consumers to buy them. This goes to the distribution chain. They want the buyers, the whole sellers, the grocery managers to know about Mexican avocados. California has owned that product. Now Mexico is looking for their opportunity. As far as the money goes, I guess they sell a lot of avocados.</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, they're supposed to be a non-profit -- this group from Mexico. And then, it seems a little.</p><p>FREEMAN: Because they spend all their money on that.</p><p>TURKEL: Like the NFL.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right. We've got to go. Thanks, guys. All right. The past is in the past, unless you are into politics. An unflattering profile of Jeb Bush could shake things up for the GOP frontman.</p><p>And Kanye West might be the only person in the world who isn't happy at a waffle house. Look at how miserable he looks. I guess greasy breakfast carbs smothered in butter and whip cream aren't his thing. At the end of the day, it's all about money and waffles, as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief. Big tech company is quietly acting to save their advertising revenues. Report say that Google and Microsoft have been painting off a German ad blocker which stop ads from showing on the website. Blocking technology could be seen as a threat to the whole online ad industry -- Yeah, I bet -- which is worth as much as $120 billion.</p><p>Manufacturing fell more than expected last month to a reading of 53.5. Anything above 50 is good but the index has now weakened for the third straight month not a positive sign for the economy.</p><p>And Apple stores will now have safes to protect its new line of smart watches. Gold Apple watches will retail for thousands of dollars. But keep them top the way in the back. That's the latest from the Fox Business Network giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>FRANCIS: <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>rolling out his new $4 trillion budget proposal for 2016. The plan includes increased taxes on capital gains and a controversial corporate tax reform. Our own Peter Barnes is at the White House with more. Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, let me reiterate the highlights of this drilling down into the $4 trillion. The president wants to spend $1.1 trillion in discretionary spending. That would be a 7 percent increase from the current fiscal year, about $75 billion in additional spending split evenly -- about evenly between the Defense Department and non-defense programs. And he wants to blow through the sequester of 2011.</p><p>He is also looking at more than trillion dollars in tax increases on higher income families raising capital gains tax rates, by applying it to inheritances, to raising the state taxes, by limiting tax deductions for wealthier families. He proposes nearly $500,000 million in new spending on infrastructure and highway and bridges. A tax most of that financed with that financed with a new 14 percent on repatriated profits of U.S. companies overseas. The Republicans say this is all a dead on arrival. And they are going to be proposing their own budget. Melissa, back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: So things just as usual. Perfect. Peter, thank you so much.</p><p>BARNES: You bet.</p><p>FRANCIS: Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, getting some major love from the Hawkeye State. A new poll from the Des Moines register shows walker leading the way with likely Iowa caucus voters at 15 percent. Senator Rand Paul right on his heels with 14 percent. It is worth noting that this poll was done before Mitt Romney called it quits. Todd Starnes and John Lonski are back to discuss this. Todd, what do you think is this surprising to you that Scott was -- kind of his neck on the woods?</p><p>STARNES: You know, it is his neck of the woods. But when you really step back and look at Scott walker and his story and what he's able to accomplish in Wisconsin, this guy really could be a contender. So I'm excited to see how he does as more people get to know his story and what he did in Wisconsin.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, John, what do you think its economics would mean for the country?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, I think his performance in Wisconsin has been excellent from the viewpoint of the markets.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: Right now, it cost only $32 to insure $10,000 worth of Wisconsin government debt. In neighboring Illinois, that premium is over $190. He's done a great job. And this is a difficult.</p><p>FRANCIS: So that's a wonderful point. So explaining to our audience what that means is that he is more credit worthy because of what he has done in the state and how.</p><p>LONSKI: Precisely.</p><p>FRANCIS: . he tights the budget.</p><p>LONSKI: He knows how to run a government and how to control the budget. And that's something I think a lot of Americans very much want from Washington.</p><p>FRANCIS: And nobody in Washington seems to know how to do it all. So he could really bring that math to D.C. That's a good point. All right. Meanwhile, a non-flattering profile of Jeb Bush testing the theory that all press is good press. The \"Boston Globe\" publishing a lengthy write-up on Bush's prep school years with classmates alleging that Bush was a heavy pot smoker and at times he was even a bully which if you have kids right now, you know, that's the worst thing that you could say about a child right now, that they are a bully. I mean that's like one of the big things.</p><p>STARNES: You know, I had a chance to read this piece in the \"Boston Globe\", Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Did you? Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: It's not like he was sitting in his dorm room listening to, you know, barbata rock (ph) and smoking crack. You know, the guy was smoking pot. And maybe he pushed around a couple kids every now and again. They said he was the tallest kid in campus. So he was a little bit of imposing figure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>STARNES: . but look, they did the same thing with Mitt Romney. The thing that gets me is the double standard here. The mainstream media go after the Republicans but they give the Democrats a pass.</p><p>FRANCIS: Well, I mean he was in high school.</p><p>LONSKI: Oh, yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm so glad I didn't do anything bad in high school. I mean, right.</p><p>LONSKI: Neither did I, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: But the reality is I'd be a hypocrite if I stated that. So we're all hypocrites. You know, we all tell our children not to make the mistakes we made.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: But that does not make us hypocrites.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. No. That's amazing. Meanwhile, the governor <person><nameText>Chris Christie </nameText></person>meeting with British prime minister David Cameron in London today. The rest of the country, though, they had no idea who he was. A 63-year-old nurse summing up her feelings for Christie by saying, quote, \"I enjoyed American politics, but I've never heard of him.\" She says she enjoys American politics like, \"They're amusing from afar -- those American politics.\" You know, it (inaudible) you guys are idiots but I do not know who this joker is. Like that's basically she said. What do you think, John?</p><p>LONSKI: Well, You know, it's not surprising. They don't know who he is because he hasn't done that great of a job controlling New Jersey's budget, you know, what I referred to earlier.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't think they have a clue about New Jersey's budget.</p><p>LONSKI: Well, why.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know local politicians.</p><p>LONSKI: He can't take care of his own house.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>LONSKI: I mean why should you care about him on the global stage?</p><p>STARNES: Yeah. I mean here, he is an anomaly because he hollers at people he doesn't like. They do that all the time.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is right.</p><p>STARNES: So that's a few things but.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right. If you watch the House of Parliament get together and they're all screaming at each other.</p><p>STARNES: They wear haltered wig. That's what I want to know.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. I don't know.</p><p>STARNES: How he might go to look with it (ph)?</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. He's trying to look like he has international experience or he can -- and everybody's like. \"Who is this guy?\"</p><p>STARNES: International mystery.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. He didn't wear the red sweater so that counts for something. Thanks, guys. Heading in to the last hour of trading, let's check in with Liz Claman and see what she's got coming up with her program. Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, COUNTDOWN HOST: Well, you just were talking about the Super Bowl commercials, which ones hit it, which ones didn't. Who won the social media show? How about that? Who stole that show? Was it Facebook or Twitter? There is a huge discrepancy, trust me, between the two numbers. Wait until you hear who comes out on top.</p><p>And on top of that, these two experts that we have coming in are going to talk about who stole the actual commercial show. And they are experts. Netbase Aggregates -- a lot of the data. Peter Caswell, their smarty pants guy, he actually has some hard data on who might have won the commercials in here.</p><p>And Lance Ulanoff, Mashable's editor-at-large is very opinionated. And he has a very good sense of the winners there.</p><p>And college students, Melissa, you know they're in the prime of their life. At least, Amazon Prime thinks they are. They are striking deals with universities now to make sure that college kids have the most robin as they need overnight. Yes, Amazon Prime hooking up with all kinds of universities and colleges to grab the college dollars. They need the student body money, Melissa.</p><p>Is this going to be big? Well, Ripley MacDonald of Amazon thinks so. He's the direct or of student programs. That plus the S&amp;P hits a 2015 low. So we're going to be looking at the markets and asking this question of our traders. Time to go to cash? Maybe, maybe not.</p><p>FRANCIS: Liz, sounds like a great show. I can't wait.</p><p>CLAMAN: OK.</p><p>FRANCIS: The Super Bowl going head to head with Hollywood. \"American Sniper\" is still raking in the dough.</p><p>Plus, the Super Bowl hang over. Hopefully, you didn't called out sick today because if you did, you are not alone and we're all very suspicious. You can never have too much money.</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it's on Wall Street or Main Street, here's who's making and losing money today -- anyone with a piece of Shake Shack. The stock hitting a new low after more than doubling during it's debut last week. That is not so great news for founder Danny Meyer who has more than 7 million shares meaning he lost $9 million since waking up. At least he has delicious burgers to make him feel better. We went to Shake Shack this weekend, it was awesome.</p><p>Plus, working at the Super Bowl -- Missy Elliott. Spotify reporting a streaming increase for the rapper. Her songs are up nearly 700 percent after the game. Missy's hit song, \"Lose Control\" is up more than 1300 percent.</p><p>Headliner, Katy Perry seeing an overall increase around 85 percent for her music. And \"American Sniper\" tops the Box Office again. The Clint Eastwood film raking in more than $30 million this weekend. That brings to the total gross of nearly $250 million. Wow. They're doing well with that one.</p><p>Now, for a little fun with spare change. If you are watching this show from your couch at home, you are not alone. Nearly, 1.5 million Americans are calling out sick today. We're not buying it. Bruce is back with me.</p><p>So Bruce, I love this. It is the most common day of the year to call in sick because it is the first Monday in February. People love to call on sick on Mondays because it just makes sense your week is not quite over. It's the dead of winter. We have a storm going on here on the northeast. And it's the day it's the day after the Super Bowl. In my book, anyone who called in sick today, I'm sorry, looks completely bogus. You're better off coming in to work vomiting on someone and going home, right?</p><p>TURKEL: Absolutely. That was my dad saying, \"Anybody who calls in sick on Monday is not sick.\" We had two in our office but they had good excuses. Allison had a baby on Friday. Roberto is injury duty. So my office is cool.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>TURKEL: I think the rest of them, yeah, it's kind of bogus.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's a little bogus.1.5 million people are expected to call in sick today. 4.4 million arrived late.</p><p>TURKEL: And hung over.</p><p>FRANCIS: And hung over because the Super Bowl was awesome and you had to watch it to the end. Some good excuses that we've heard along the way. My uniform caught fire when I put it in the microwave to dry. I like that one. I accidentally got on a plane. Yup, me too. That's a good one.</p><p>TURKEL: The (inaudible) allows that everyday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, right. Exactly. What are some good ones that you've heard, Bruce?</p><p>TURKEL: The best ones I've heard is the people who call up and try to sound sick and they're talking, \"You know, I can't come in.\" You don't sound sick. And you're trying so hard.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>TURKEL: . to sound sick. But you know, if you stayed out and had a lot to drink, you woke up a little green and it's my office -- stay away. I don't like your idea of coming in and throwing up on my desk. I can do it without them.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. I don't know. I mean just for myself, if you don't want to want to look like you're calling out and it's not true.</p><p>TURKEL: Prove it.</p><p>FRANCIS: . have you ever called in sick on Super Bowl Monday? Bruce, you strike me as someone who would never call in sick no matter what.</p><p>TURKEL: Never. Never.</p><p>FRANCIS: No?</p><p>TURKEL: Absolutely not.</p><p>FRANCIS: Maybe the NFL should move the game to Saturday night.</p><p>TURKEL: Well, I think they figured out when they can get the highest viewership. Remember, Saturday night is a profitable night for a lot of reasons. Sunday night is not. And so, they show up on Sunday. They get the highest ratings of any show in history. I think they figured out that right. And by the way, the NFL does not care if your employees don't show up for work the next day.</p><p>FRANCIS: No. They definitely -- I mean they focus at the victory because you're at home watching television.</p><p>TURKEL: Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS: So you could be watching other NFL shows, NFL network. I mean it's a win-win all the way around. Bruce Turkel, thank you so much.</p><p>TURKEL: Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: So we ask what crazy excuses you've heard for not coming in to work. And you guys didn't disappoint us. On Facebook, Stephanie writes, \"Once I said my cat was sick because I wanted to enjoy the freakish plenty fall Seattle day in my new sports car.\"</p><p>And Andy tweets, \"I dreamed I was fired so I stayed home.\" That was an excuse that he used. Jonathan says, \"I didn't use this myself.\" Sure, Jonathan. \"But a coworker once used, my hair hurts.\" I loved that one. That's somebody who wants to be fired. My hair hurts.</p><p>Follow me on Twitter @melissaafrancis or like me on facebook.com/MelissaFrancisFox. If you follow me on Twitter could really fun especially when something bad happens at a restaurant. I'm just saying.</p><p>They may be beautiful, but they're certainly not rich. Young people finally get proved that mom and dad had it easier. So maybe a little help with that cellphone bill isn't out of the question. At the end of the day, it's all about money -- money and Monday.</p><p>FRANCIS: Celebrities they are just like us. The night before John Legend's super model wife, Chrissy Teigen joined Kim and Kanye West for a quality dinner. Check it out. The foursome hit up a nearby waffle house where Kanye West reported sought (ph) for the entire meal. Like that's really a surprise. So you think he's more of a pancakes or scrambled eggs kind of guy? Why would you not want to go to waffle house for dinner? He's so pouty.</p><p>All right. Crashing student debts. Now, that millennials are making $2,000 less than their parents did at their age, recently released senses data reveals that young people basically everywhere except on the east coast and had seen their earnings drop since 1980. James and John are back with us. Not really surprised but depressing nonetheless. James.</p><p>FREEMAN: It is depressing. I think it goes back to the story that started your broadcast, which is you cannot go after investment and business income because that is the money that funds technology and equipment, which is what allows people to make more money. So if you want these kids to have more salaries, you've to allow businesses to put the technology into the workplace that will justify those higher salaries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: You've got to be careful not to over regulate the economy because the reality today is that these young people will be facing every increasing competition from the skilled and always cheaper workforce of emerging market countries.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. And I mean if you look at this as a parent who has no control over those kind of things other than your vote which you have -- but it can be so frustrating to watch our politicians screw things up -- what my takeaway from this is I got to stir my kids towards the jobs where they can actually make money more than ever. You know, look out in the future and -- they got to learn to code and they've got to get out there and do the things that are going to help them because kids are falling behind right?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you want skills that can give them a lot of options. But I think the problem right now it's policy and yes, part of it is K-12 education. But the big part is we're not seeing business creation because we don't have an environment that lets people grow without taxation and regulation. And that really is a -- it's the irony of the Obama era. All the people that he talks about helping.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . have had terrible time since he was elected.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right, John? Yeah.</p><p>LONSKI: He's exactly right. That's a sad story because it's actually the lower classes that have feared the worst over the last eight years or so.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Absolutely. All right, gentlemen. Thanks to both of you. I wanted to show you something fun before we go. Bruce Turkel sent this to me when we were doing our Super Bowl segment. Take a look that. That's Katy Perry in her costume from last night. Right next to her that's Will Ferrell from \"Blades of Glory\".</p><p>I think Katy may have borrowed the costume. What do you think, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah. It's a classic. I mean not quite on the level (inaudible) but it certainly.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . a nommage at the Super Bowl.</p><p>FRANCIS: Fabulous. I know. John, you want to get in there?</p><p>LONSKI: In this side of economy, you got to be much more creative. (inaudible)</p><p>FRANCIS: I love it. Pretty facts. Economics no matter what. My head is off to you, John Lonski. Thank you. That's all the money we have for you. Here's Liz.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The 33-year-old chief executive has a team of 12 moderators dedicated to deleting comments and spam from his page, according to Bloomberg. He has a \"handful\" of employees who help him write his posts and speeches and a number of professional photographers who take perfectly stage-managed pictures of him meeting veterans in Kentucky, small-business owners in Missouri or cheesesteak vendors in Philadelphia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's locked-down nature means mere mortals can't see the private posts on Zuckerberg's timeline, but it is hard to imagine him getting into arguments about a racist relative's post of an anti-immigration meme. And it is not just Zuckerberg. None of the company's key executives has a \"normal\" Facebook presence. You can't add them as friends, they rarely post publicly and they keep private some information that the platform suggests be made public by default, such as the number of friends they have.</p><p>Over at Twitter, the story is the same. Of the company's nine most senior executives, only four tweet more than once a day on average. Ned Segal, its chief financial officer, has been on the site for more than six years and has sent fewer than two tweets a month. Co-founder Jack Dorsey, a relatively prolific tweeter, has sent about 23,000 since the site was launched, but that is a lot less than even halfway engaged users have sent over the same period. Dorsey rarely replies to strangers and avoids discussions or arguments on the site. He doesn't live-tweet TV shows or sporting fixtures. In fact, he does not really \"use\" Twitter; he just posts on it occasionally.</p><p> Related:  I was Mark Zuckerberg's mentor. Today I would tell him: your users are in peril</p><p>It is a pattern that holds true across the sector. For all the industry's focus on \"eating your own dog food\", the most diehard users of social media are rarely those sitting in a position of power.</p><p>I am a compulsive social media user. I have sent about 140,000 tweets since I joined Twitter in April 2007 - six Jacks' worth. I use Instagram, Snapchat and Reddit daily. I have accounts on Ello, Peach and Mastodon (remember them? No? Don't worry). Three years ago, I managed to quit Facebook. I went cold turkey, deleting my account in a moment of lucidity about how it made me feel and act. I have never regretted it, but I haven't been able to pull the same stunt twice.</p><p>I used to look at the heads of the social networks and get annoyed that they didn't understand their own sites. Regular users encounter bugs, abuse or bad design decisions that the executives could never understand without using the sites themselves. How, I would wonder, could they build the best service possible if they didn't use their networks like normal people?</p><p>Now, I wonder something else: what do they know that we don't?</p><p>Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook, broke the omerta in October last year, telling a conference in Philadelphia that he was \"something of a conscientious objector\" to social media.</p><p>\"The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them ... was all about: 'How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?' That means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post or whatever. And that's going to get you to contribute more content and that's going to get you ... more likes and comments,\" he said.</p><p>The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works</p><p>  Former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya    </p><p>\"It's a social-validation feedback loop ... exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. The inventors, creators - me, Mark [Zuckerberg], Kevin Systrom on Instagram, all of these people - understood this consciously. And we did it anyway.\"</p><p>A month later, Parker was joined by another Facebook objector, former vice-president for user growth Chamath Palihapitiya. \"The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth,\" Palihapitiya said at a conference in Stanford, California. \"This is not about Russian ads. This is a global problem. It is eroding the core foundations of how people behave by and between each other. I can control my decision, which is that I don't use that shit. I can control my kids' decisions, which is that they're not allowed to use that shit.\"</p><p>Palihapitiya's statements rattled Facebook so much that the company issued a response acknowledging its past failings - a rare move for a business that, despite its mission to \"connect people\", is notoriously taciturn about its shortcomings. \"When Chamath was at Facebook, we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world,\" a company spokeswoman said. \"Facebook was a very different company back then... as we have grown, we have realised how our responsibilities have grown, too. We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve.\"</p><p>A few days later, the site pulled a more interesting move, releasing the results of research that suggested that Facebook did make users feel bad - but only if they didn't post enough. \"In general, when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information - reading, but not interacting with people - they report feeling worse afterward,\" two Facebook researchers said in a review of the existing literature. On the other hand, \"actively interacting with people - especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions - is linked to improvements in wellbeing\". How convenient. </p><p>For Adam Alter, a psychologist and the author of Irresistible, an examination of technology addiction, it is almost besides the point whether social media makes you happy or sad in the short term. The deeper issue is that your usage is compulsive - or even addictive.</p><p>\"The addiction concept applies much more broadly and to many more behaviours than we perhaps thought and also therefore applies to many more people in the population,\" Alter says. \"Roughly half the adult population has at least one behavioural addiction. Not many of us have substance addictions, but the way the world works today there are many, many behaviours that are hard for us to resist and a lot of us develop self-undermining attachments to those behaviours that border on or become addictions.\"</p><p>These addictions haven't happened accidentally, Alter argues. Instead, they are a direct result of the intention of companies such as Facebook and Twitter to build \"sticky\" products, ones that we want to come back to over and over again. \"The companies that are producing these products, the very large tech companies in particular, are producing them with the intent to hook. They're doing their very best to ensure not that our wellbeing is preserved, but also that we spend as much time on their products and on their programs and apps as possible. That's their key goal: it's not to make a product that people enjoy and therefore becomes profitable, but rather to make a product that people can't stop using and therefore becomes profitable.</p><p>\"What Parker and Palihapitiya are saying is that these companies, companies that they've been exposed to at the highest levels and from very early on, have been founded on these principles - that we should do everything we possibly can to hack human psychology, to understand what it is that keeps humans engaged and to use those techniques not to maximise wellbeing, but to maximise engagement. And that's explicitly what they do.\"</p><p>Parker and Palihapitiya aren't the only Silicon Valley residents to open up about their unease with the habit-forming nature of modern technology. As the Guardian reported in October, a growing number of coders and designers are quitting their jobs in disillusionment at what their work entails. From Chris Marcellino - one of the inventors of Apple's system for push notifications, who quit the industry to train as a neurosurgeon - to Loren Britcher - who created the pull-to-refresh motion that turns so many apps into miniature one-armed-bandits and is now devoting his time to building a house in New Jersey - many of the workers at the coalface of interface design have had second thoughts.</p><p>Others have had the same realisation, but have decided to embrace the awkwardness - such as LA-based retention consultants Dopamine Labs. The company offers a plugin service that personalises \"moments of joy\" in apps that use it. It promises customers : \"Your users will crave it. And they'll crave you.\"</p><p>If this is the case, then social media executives are simply following the rule of pushers and dealers everywhere, the fourth of the Notorious BIG's Ten Crack Commandments: \"Never get high on your own supply.\"</p><p>\"Many tech titans are very, very careful about how they privately use tech and how they allow their kids to use it and the extent to which they allow their kids access to screens and various apps and programs,\" says Alter. \"They will get up on stage, some of them, and say things like: 'This is the greatest product of all time,' but then when you delve you see they don't allow their kids access to that same product.\"</p><p>Tech by itself doesn't want to be good... It takes humans to make sure that the things that you do with it are good</p><p>  Apple chief executive Tim Cook    </p><p>Last week, Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, told the Guardian : \"I don't have a kid, but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won't allow. I don't want them on a social network.\"</p><p>He added: \"Technology by itself doesn't want to be good and it doesn't want to be bad either. It takes humans to make sure that the things that you do with it are good. And it takes humans in the development process to make sure the creation of the product is a good thing.\"</p><p>Alter says that the classic example of this approach is Cook's predecessor, Steve Jobs, \"who spoke about all the virtues of the iPad and then wouldn't let his kids near it\". (\"They haven't used it,\" Jobs told a New York Times reporter a few months after the iPad was released. \"We limit how much technology our kids use at home.\")</p><p>It is not only children. \"You can see it in their own behaviour,\" Alter says. \"Jack Dorsey, the way he uses Twitter, it seems he's very careful about how much time he spends. He's obviously a very busy guy and a very high-functioning guy, but as a result he's probably distracted by a lot of other things and he's able to tear himself away from the platform.</p><p>\"But that's not true for all of the users of Twitter - many of them report being, using the colloquial term, addicted. Whether or not that's clinical addiction, it feels to them like they would like to be doing less; it's undermining their wellbeing. And I think that's absolutely right: for many Twitter users, it's sort of a black hole that sucks you in and it's very hard to stop using the program.\"</p><p>That is certainly how I feel about Twitter. I have tried to cut back, after realising how much of my time was spent staring at a scrolling feed of aphorisms ranging from mildly amusing to vaguely traumatic. I deleted 133,000 tweets, in an effort to reduce the feeling that I couldn't give up on something into which I had sunk so much time. I removed the apps from my phone and my computer, forcing any interaction through the web browser. I have taken repeated breaks. But I keep coming back.</p><p>It is one thing to be a child with a protective parent keeping technology away from you. It is quite another to live like a technology executive yourself, defeating the combined effort of thousands of the world's smartest people to instil a craving to open their app every day. I am not alone in struggling.</p><p> Related:  How big tech finally awakened to the horror of its own inventions</p><p>Kevin Holesh, a freelance app developer, is one of those who tried to cut back. He wrote a program, Moment, that tracks how long you spend looking at your phone each day. For the average user, it is more than three hours every day. Holesh's stats were enough to provide the motivation for change. \"Once I had the hard data, that itself was helping me use my phone less. I've taken a few steps in that direction since, but I knew just seeing the number itself was half the battle. Seeing that number really changed my approach ... I was spending an hour a day not doing anything productive, just wasting time.\"</p><p>Holesh eventually removed all social networks, and his work email account, from his phone. \"That's the step that helps me the most, simply not having it accessible. At first, my mission was just: find out what amount of phone time makes you happy. But now I've started a little more extreme approach, I'm less stressed out about news articles or my uncle posting something inflammatory on Facebook. I find I do a better job of communicating in more old-fashioned methods.\"</p><p>Alter says willpower can help to a certain extent, while leaving things out of reach for casual, thoughtless use can help more. Ultimately, however, addictions are hard to break alone.</p><p>\"It's possible that in 20 years we'll look back at the current generation of children and say: 'Look, they are socially different from every other generation of humans that came before and as a result this is a huge problem and maybe we need to regulate these behaviours.' Or perhaps we'll look back and say: 'I don't know what the fuss was - I'm not sure why we were so concerned.' Until we have some evidence, until there's something that seems tangible, I think it's going to be very hard to get people en masse to change how they behave.\"</p><p>If you can't bring yourself to cut back on social media, you could try following Zuckerberg's example and hire a team of 12 to do it for you. It might not be as cheap and easy as deleting Facebook, but it is probably easier to stick to.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-40456086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGB-27W1-F021-6418-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2346\"/><timeReceived>12:27 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 12th.  Your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  Getting the agenda back on track, President  Trump expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin, tomorrow.  The move  comes as the White House moves past the controversy surrounding Jim Comey's  testimony last week.  First Daughter, Ivanka Trump, was asked on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" earlier about her father's response to that controversy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  My father felt very  vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels  incredibly optimistic but, you know, at the White House and throughout the  administration we were incredibly focused on the reason we all went to  Washington.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.</p><p>TRUMP:  And what we're fighting for.  So last week, while it didn't get the  level of headlines, it will ultimately have a much more important impact,  it was infrastructure week, focusing on the commitment to rebuild this  country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More from Ivanka Trump's interview ahead.  Outrage in Central  Park, a New York City play using a President Trump look-alike for the role  of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  The fallout as both Delta and Bank of  America pulled their sponsorships.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, Jeff Immelt out at General Electric.  The  company announcing earlier this morning that he will be replaced by John  Flannery as chairman and CEO.  Flannery, the current president and CEO of  G.E. Healthcare.  G.E. shares up three percent on the news, that stock down  this year, down in the last year, and down about 28 percent during Immelt's  tenure since 2001.</p><p>Futures are showing losses across the board, 34-point loss on the Dow  Futures, we keep a very close eye on what happens with technology stocks.   These big names, your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and  Microsoft had been your major market leaders, pulling the rest of the  market along all year and they took a beating on Friday and many of them  lower in premarket trading.</p><p>In Europe, stocks also heading south, we have a one percent loss in France  and in Germany.  Same story in Asia overnight, you have red across your  screen with the biggest loser there being the Hang Seng, down one and a  quarter percent.</p><p>And the Penguins putting the Predators on ice.  Pittsburgh topping  Nashville to win its second straight Stanley Cup.  The highlights from that  big win ahead.  Plus, Jimmy Carter, the president - former president taking  flight, the former leader of the free world, a video of him going viral  after he took the time to great everyone on his plane.  The presidential  surprise for passengers, the surprise being Mr. Carter was flying  commercial.  There you go.  All of that -- cancer survivor, by the way, as  well, all of that and so much more coming up.</p><p>Financial analyst, Heather Zumarraga, Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist, Michael Block, and PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle.  Good to see  you, one and all, this morning.  </p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's on your mind?  Immelt out.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEADER:  I'm interested  to see what happens with those big tech names because if they start to  continue to sell off, they're so heavy in the indices, that it could start  dragging the market down and start getting everybody worried that Trump  rally is a thing of the past.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Dated.  NASDAQ down 1.8 percent on Friday.  We'll see if we get  some follow through today to see if there's a sector rotation, as the  NASDAQ is pulling back, the Dow has been hitting new all-time highs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Russell 2000, the small-cap stocks (INAUDIBLE) a record  on Friday.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  That's a good story though.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  The Russell caught  up too.  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. </p><p>BLOCK:  Russell caught up because everyone was shorted?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Sector rotation. </p><p>BLOCK:  No, no.  It's squeezing.  Full state of rotation continues.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And the Fed is hiking this week.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  Very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I mean, take that one to the bank I think what Jon  Hilsenrath would have done.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- got lost in the headlines when you never know what happens  with Sessions' testimony.  So .</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll keep it in the headlines right here on Fox Business as we  always do.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can talk about everything.  Joining the conversation this  morning, former Texas Congressman Presidential Candidate, Ron Paul, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Mr. Stuart Varney.  We always love to see Mr.  Varney.  To our story this hour, today is the deadline for parties  challenging the president's travel ban to respond to a petition from  justice department. </p><p>The petition asks the Supreme Court to allow the president's executive  order to go into effect.  Despite opposition, Texas Attorney General Ken  Paxton says the president has the right to enact this ban.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We think we're absolutely right on the  law, there's a federal law that clearly gives the president the authority  to do this.  This travel ban is right in line with that statute.  And so,  we're confident if the court actually follows federal law, that the  president will be just fine.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is the co-founder of Diligence LLC, former CIA  Operative Mike Baker.  I don't even know where you are but I know you  parachuted in or tunneled in.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  He can't tell you where he is.  I'm at  the - I'm at the compound right now.  It's a secret - it's a secret  location except I got a picture of it behind me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why you have to - this is why you have to follow Mike on  Twitter because it's always like he's on a - like a gator boat, like a fan  boat coming in.</p><p>BAKER:  Get in your boat -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, is these bans a significant step in focusing on national  security?  </p><p>BAKER:  Well, you know, it's become this outsized thing that is chewing up  a lot of political capital and a lot of - a lot of attention and it really  didn't need to, it's important and it - and it should be done, and the  previous administration, you know, the Obama administration had identified  and outlined the same problem but because of the messaging issues, the  discipline coming out of the White House in this current administration,  it's unfortunately - it's taken on this concept that somehow the travel ban  is critical for national security.  Well, it's an element of national  security.</p><p>It is a very simple process, you've got these states, these nations that  are essentially failed states.  And the previous administration agreed and  the idea being is, well, let's take a break, let's review internally our  processes for how we -- how we do a the vetting, how we do the due  diligence, the background checking on people who want to come to this  country from these particular failed states, where there's no  infrastructure, there's no ability to reach in and in a logical and  efficient manner, check databases and talk to people to understand who are  these people that want to come in.</p><p>It's s simply that and then once you do that, fine, improve your systems  and the suspension is over.  But that's not the way it works, so it's  become this thing that like I said is just chewing up a tremendous amount  of political capital.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the same time that you have this new developing diplomatic  crisis in the Middle East with Qatar, now hiring Former Attorney General  John Ashcroft in response to accusation that the nation supports terror  groups in the region.  Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf nations cut  diplomatic ties with Qatar last week over the terror allegations, Egyptian  billionaire businessman Naguib Sawiris backing the decision on Wall Street  Week when he talked to Maria on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Tell us  why you're advising your colleagues in business to take their money out of  Qatar right now?  </p><p>NAGUIB SAWIRIS, EGYPTIAN BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN:  Well, I'm not just  advising them to take their money out to Qatar, I'm advising them not to  deal with Qatar, point, you know, because we are all watching every day, we  wake up hearing a lunatic that - or a savage person that went -- goes with  the car and kills innocent people or like in my own country here, they stop  the bus with children and women and shot the - shot the men in front of the  eyes of the women and every day we hear all these incidents, you know.</p><p>And nobody is doing anything against it and we need to come to the bottom  of that and the -- one country that declares openly that it is supporting  terror, you know, like Hamas or other organizations that's siding with Iran  openly that all intelligence services of the world have all materials  showing that they're supporting all the terrorists and extremist groups in  Middle East from Libya, in Syria, in Iraq and everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, what is this rift in Qatar mean for us because again, this  comes on the heels of Obama-backed and brokered Iranian nuclear deal.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And then - and, you know, that sound bite there, gave away  the sort of the reason why this has exploded into an issue, and it's Iran.   So this is essentially at the top line, a conflict between the Saudis and  Iran, and the Saudis, Iran obviously has their Lex Luthor and, you know,  they are locked in this battle for influence and in the region.  So the  Saudis have exerted a great deal of pressure on some of these other  countries that Egypt included to isolate Qatar.</p><p>You know, the truth of the matter is that, you know, they're all complicit  in different ways over different periods of time and either financing or  somehow supporting or looking the other way in terms of Islamic extremism.   So Qatar doesn't stand alone in that and what needs to happen and what's  going to be extremely difficult is, you know, the U.S. in particular, we're  going to need to find a way to step into that breach and bring them back  together in a fashion because we're not going to - we're not going to do  this, we're not going to beat terrorism by isolating Qatar.</p><p>You know, we've got a military base there, and different things can be true  at the same time in Middle East.  You can be working with a partner out  there who on one hand, at a one side of their mouth helps you with certain  terrorist operations or providing intelligence, to us and our liaise on  partners, at the same time there can be elements within that government  that sympathize or support terrorism or business that do same thing.  You  got, you know, you got to deal with, you know, the world is that exists and  not try to find some perfect ending.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Mike, Mitch Roschelle, with all those Sunni-Shia conflict  that's going on, doesn't Iran just need trading partners and maybe they  were looking to make a friend in Qatar because there's so many players in  the region that just will trade with them and they need trading partners?</p><p>BAKER:  Well, sure, they like as many trading partners as possible but, you  know, over the top of that is the fact that Iran is doing it for the  regime's best interest which is to drive a wedge between these countries  and to try to degree possible to pull them out of the Saudi sphere.  Again,  this is - this is a Saudi-Iranian dispute.  I wouldn't ascribe any sort of  innocent economic reasoning behind anything that the Iranian regime does.</p><p>So I think - I think your take on it, while there is an element of economic  truth there, the reality is it's more nefarious than that.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Mike, what's the - what's the endgame for Qatar here?  Because  they've been very Machiavellian I would say, they play from both sides,  they're friends with everybody that have Al-Jazeera, you know (INAUDIBLE)  they deal with Iran, they were dealing with the west - we have the big base  there, you know, it sounds like probably they're getting called on playing  both sides here.  How does this end for them?  Is there something that  taunts where that continues or is the line drawn and they have to choose a  side or have a side chosen for them?  </p><p>BAKER:  No.  I don't think it's going to be a hardline decision at the end  where they, you know, that's it, there's a final break from, you know, from  the -- sort of this traditional alliance where, you know, to some degree  they have been aligned with UAE and Egypt and the others, and Saudis.  I  think what will happen is -- I hope what will happen is that there will be  a significant diplomatic effort led by Rex Tillerson and some others.</p><p>And at the end of the day, we'll heal the rift to some degree, they'll open  the borders, there will be business but we have to be pragmatic and  understand that, you know, again, there will be this duplicity that exists,  so that's not just - again, it's not just Qatar.  I mean, look at the  Saudis in the way over the time they dealt with the devil, they've turned  the other way and in terms of allowing the extremism to build in exchange  for, you know, stability within the kingdom.</p><p>So, you know, the Middle East is one of those places where, you know, it's  on satisfactory but you have to deal with who exists there and you have to  understand it would be very, very hard line pragmatic about this to  understand that they're going to be duplicities in the way that they act  when it comes to extremism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, when you leave, do you ignite your jet propulsion pack  since why you're sitting in the state.  Why right out? </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.  We tend to - everything disappears, you know, it's a  little bit like Mr. Wolfe, you know, you got to clean the place up and then  you go and, you know, and you find another place where we can do another  segment.  But yes, it's - it is what it is.  Look, I'm out in Idaho, I'm  going to release that information to the public, I was going to give it to  a friend and then you're going to hand it the press but I'm in Idaho, and  anybody out there watching hasn't been to Idaho, I'm here to tell you, it's  one of the greatest states in the nation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really is.  It is stunningly beautiful but I would deeply,  deeply appreciate your Winston Wolfe reference.  </p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Baker.  Big love always.  Mike Baker joining us.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A scare in the air for flyers aboard at flight to  Shanghai, a plane forced to turn around after a hole rips open in the  engine.  And a shake-up at the top of General Electric, Jeff Immelt out.   We look at future of this company because the road since he took over in  '01 was a lo rocky one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news this morning.  General Electric getting a new  leader.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey Dagen,  that's right.  G.E. CEO Jeff Immelt is retiring, he's ending a 16-year run  as the leader of industrial conglomerate.  He's going to be replaced by  John Flannery in August who's currently the president and CEO of G.E.  Healthcare.  Now, the possible move first reported by our very ow3n Charlie  Gasparino.  He broke that news on the tensions between Immelt and activist  investor Nelson Peltz.</p><p>That report from Charlie - excuse me, was back in March.  General Electric  says Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the  year.  Flannery going to take on that title, January 1st.  Immelt has taken  steps to reship - reshape G.E. after the financial crisis for the company.   They have struggled a boost profit there.  As you can see, there is the  stock in the premarket, it is rallying.  G.E. shares are rallying up a  little more than three percent.  That will actually help balance out the  Dow when we open up at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.  </p><p>Also, we're following this story for you.  A huge hole in a China Eastern  plane forced an emergency landing in Australia.  Passengers of the flight  from the city to Shanghai said the engine made a massive amount of noise  right after takeoff.  Pilots reported problems about an hour into the  journey.  The plane had to return to Sydney, it land safely.  Passengers  were evacuated from plane but luckily, there were no injuries there.</p><p>Well, a Trump t-shirt censored in a high school yearbook.  Grant Berardo  took his high school pictures in New Jersey wearing Trump campaign shirt,  this is Make America Great Again but the t-shirt was later digitally  altered to remove the campaign slogan in the actual yearbook.  The school  superintendent is investigating this, says there is no policy prohibiting  political messages in schools pictures.</p><p>And then this, passengers on a recent Delta Airlines flight got a big  surprise.  Former President Jimmy Carter was on board and before the plane  took off, he walked up and down the aisle shook hands with passengers.   They were really excited.  There you go.  This is the tweeted video shows  the 92-year-old former president smiling as he walked down the aisle.  He  greets everybody.  The passenger tweeted the video, said, everybody seemed  really excited.  And the overall sense it was just really nice to have that  kind of moment where party or politics \"Didn't matter.\"  One of the most --  I think revered ex-presidents we have living today, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) but a cancer survivor, you know, he went on one of  these Immunotherapy drugs from the Kansas spread to his brain spectacular  until -</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  And look at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Spectacular --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- recovery.  I wish the president talked more about that  actually.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up.  The Penguins iced the  Predators to keep the cup in Pittsburg.  Highlights from the repeat NHL  title victory in nearly 20 years.</p><p>And bling with a zing, how to Patriots are using their Super Bowl reign to  remind the Falcons off their incredible comeback in February.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The hockey season coming to a close after an exciting Stanley  Cup final between the Penguins the Predators.  Jared Max is here with the  highlights.  Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 AMERICAN SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.   I thought we were headed for sudden death overtime last night.  0-0 game  until under two minutes remaining.  Game six Stanley Cup final in  Nashville, the Predators fans continue their tradition, throwing catfish on  the ice and it looked like the Predators had reeled in the first goal of  the game.  Colton Sissons taps it in after Pittsburg goalie Matt Murray was  unable to control Filip Forsberg's shot.  1-0 Predators, right?  Wrong!</p><p>Officials had lost sight of the puck and one blew a whistle to signal the  play dead, fraction of a second before the puck went in.  0-0 to the third  and then the Penguins get this weird goal from behind the net, the former  Predator Patric Hornqvist sneaks it past Pekka Rinne, this goal counted.   Penguins 1-0, a minute later they scored through an empty net.  Celebration  was on a first time in era of salary cap.  One team wins the Stanley Cup  two straight seasons.  Penguins' parade will be this week.  No official  date yet.</p><p>Could be preparing for another championship parade and NBA one for the  Golden State Warriors soon.  Warriors up three games to one and the  Cavaliers favored to win tonight by 8.5 points, tip off scheduled for just  after 9:00 Eastern in Oakland.  We all know Air Jordans are not cheap  sneakers but what about a pair of real about Michael Jordans?  As in sneaks  worn by the basketball legend in his final game as an amateur.  Well, the  sneakers that Jordan wore in the gold medal game in the '84 Olympics at  Spain sold at auction yesterday for $190,373.  Almost 200 grand.  Yes,  highest known price paid for game-worn shoes.  I even had Jordans orthotics  and the autograph.</p><p>Back page of the New York Post today asks the question, he hit it how far?   New York Yankees star Aaron Judge, longest homerun in Major League Baseball  since ESPN began tracking distance of homeruns in 2009.  Watch this.  Now  Judge hit two homeruns in the Yankees 14-3 win over Orioles.  This was his  first.  It traveled 4696 feet.  He is first Yankees since Mickey Mantle in  1956 two hit homers in the same game, he goes four for four, first Yankees  since Roger Maris, age 25 or younger to hit 20 homeruns before the all-star  break.  Judge has 21, he's batting 344. </p><p>Football.  You know, football said to be the sport of kings, better than  diamond rings but maybe not this ring.  Check this out, past Friday night;  New England Patriots owner Robert Craft hosted a private ceremony for his  players and team members at his home.  Well, they all got their  championship rings.  Remember that 28 to 3 comeback against the Atlanta  Falcons in Super Bowl?  So, 283 rings to recognize the 28 to 3 comeback.   283 diamonds are on this ring, it totals 5.1 carats.  And all Tom Brady  showing it off along with Martellus Bennett.  So they have a 28 to 3, a  little bit of a dig at the Falcons and also a couple of quotes on the  rings, as well from Bob Craft, the team owner, unequivocally the sweetest  and also greatest comeback all-time.  How about those rings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't wear them all at the same time.  </p><p>BLOCK:  It should have had two big diamonds on them to represent the two  times they couldn't beat the Giants in Super Bowl.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  I like that.  I like that.  That's fair.  It's a good shot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dropping the mic on that one, Mike.  Dropping the mic, Mike.  A  brain freeze attack on the baseball field video showing a young fan winning  a slurpy-sipping contest and that's going viral.  Let's watch that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Six, five, four -- and time, time, all right.  We are  going to stop.  All right.  Let's see.  Let's open , Kinley's.  Kinley,  what do you think, Rock?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Minor League Baseball (INAUDIBLE) you had to know this was going to  happen.</p><p>BLOCK:  We've all -</p><p>MAX:  Dagen, no joke like eight years ago, I was sucking down one of those  coffee (INAUDIBLE) Dunkin' Donuts, I fainted.  I'm not kidding, got brain  freeze and the next thing I knew I came to.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Are you kidding?</p><p>MAX:  No.  Serious thing.  And then I let you know -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It happened in New Orleans with the hurricane but that thing -  that was (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p>MAX:  Yes, yes, yes.  Different thing.  This had no alcohol in it.  But  yes, the brain that - it's not fun.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I thought that video was - it shows people why you should go to  Minor League Games.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  like I, you know, brain freeze?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  No, but they do really fun stuff but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like fun promotions and it's really about the community and  local community and --  </p><p>MAX:  And watching baseball and not costing, you know, $400 for the family  for it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly.  And not being a major headache against the  ballpark.  I mean - because that is part of it.  So hey, are you jealous?   Are you going to U.S. Open?</p><p>MAX:  I'm not.  I'm not going.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So are you jealous that we're going?  We're going to be -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MAX:  I'm a little bit jealous.  We can talk about that off the air.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  I am very - now I'm very excited.  I'm super excited.  </p><p>MAX:  Will you guys be texting me like, \"Hey, what's an eagle?  What's a  double-eagle?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I went to Wake Forest, as the home of Arnold Palmer, Lanny  Wadkins, Curtis Strange, Billy Andrade.  So I know my, Michael.  </p><p>MAX:  What's your handicap?  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, I am a horrible golfer.  But I know, Michael.  </p><p>MAX:  Are you looking forward to?  It should be gorgeous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: I love why -- there is nothing better than being on a course and  watching really incredible golf because you get to see firsthand, how  incredibly difficult it is.  </p><p>MAX:  Beautiful time of year also to be in Wisconsin.  Erin Hills looks to  be pretty gorgeous course.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh my gosh.  Yes.  I love the people of Wisconsin, so open your  arms, people, we'll be there Thursday and Friday.

Blake Burman at the White House with more.  Good  morning, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Dagen.  Good morning to you as well.  Last week at the White House was  infrastructure week at a rollout.  It got a bit muddled once Jim Comey  headed to Capitol Hill.  This week, they have got a new focus somewhat of a  round two.  They will be focusing on workforce development.  The main push  here according to top officials, at the White House, is on trying to build  out apprenticeship to that end.  The President will be headed on the road  this week, tomorrow, he will be going to Wisconsin, speaking at a trade  school in Waukesha, Wednesday to Labor Department, Thursday, here at the  White House.  </p><p>He has a roundtable with several state governors.  This whole issue of  workforce development has been a push of Ivanka Trump.  She was on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" this morning to tout rollout administration will be having  throughout the week and she admitted that there has been -- as she put it a  level of visual viciousness in Washington, that caught her off guard. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER:  I didn't expect it to be easy.   I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was -- I was a  little blindsided by on a personal level. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this workforce development roll  out, Dagen, Friday sources tell Fox that the President will end his  workweek in Miami where he will unveil his administration's policies as it  relates to Cuba.  You can expect at least somewhat of a rollback of the  Obama administration policies to that end.</p><p>By the way, later today here at the White House, the start off to the week  the President will have a full cabinet meeting.  All the members of his  cabinet.  Dagen, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for covering all that for us.  Blake Burman at  the White House.  Joining us now is former Texas Congressman and Republican  Presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul.  Congressman, the President is set to  hold -- Blake mentioned, first full cabinet meeting today.  Do you think  this administration will now be able to move forward on the agenda that  Americans want the reason they voted for him? </p><p>RON PAUL, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN:  It is not likely but let's hope they  move forward on right things because everything they say is not exactly  going to solve all our problems.  I don't happen to believe public works  projects is a way to get more jobs.  You might get more jobs but it won't  be same as if you got more jobs in private sector.  They make a lot of  mistakes.  I think obstacles are so great and people don't recognize the  debt.  When you have a lot of debt, it's hard to spend money.  You come up  with a trillion dollars for military and a trillion dollars for public  works and repairing highways, where is the money going to come from?  And  this has an effect at marketplaces eventually.  If you look at how much  debt is out there whether it's automobile debt, college debt, personal debt  and even housing debt right now, I mean, there is a lot of problems so that  is why I think they are stymied because the fundamentals don't change.  You  can say these jobs -- the truth is dependent on government creating jobs or  there's something wrong with the plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I am going to push back in terms of the  infrastructure plan and I will and you call it public works.  I come on  that I know that means you mean to evoke FDR's programs of the depression. </p><p>PAUL:  I do, I do. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is what you say it but trillion dollars is not going to be  -- actually a minority of it would be government money.  Under the way, the  plan is laid out now.  They would -- Trump administration would get to  trillion largely in parts from funding through private investors and the  money is indeed out there.  It was $59 billion raised last year in private  infrastructure funds.  Their goal is too easy the permitting process, easy  regulations to get that money invested in projects alongside the  government. </p><p>PAUL:  Yes.  The easing of regulations is very good and that is getting out  of the way house in order, but this whole thing is partnership that bothers  libertarians because partnerships, big businesses big banks in government  isn't exactly what a free society is all about.  That is not what a  Republic is about because only favored people get to do the dealing.  So I  don't like partnership.  I want an environment where people can be  competitive and produce things that are necessary.  But saying that we are  going to have big government financing and big business financing, there is  a lot of shortcomings with that plan. </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Dr. Paul, Mike  Block here.  You raised a very valid concerns about debt levels and  something people worry about except, I don't want to turn into a discussion  on bond market, the bond yields are not reflecting a lot of concern about  all this spending that you are talking about.  The capital markets have  this wrong?  Is there something else going on here? </p><p>PAUL:  Yes.  I think they do.  I am not an investor but just from an  economic viewpoint, I do.  You might have said tech stocks were good  investment and things happen in a flash and bond markets can happen that  way too, because all countries are in debt, and you know we have the  European problem where you have Greece, and Italy, and Spain having  problems but you are going to have something pop up.  It's going to be very  devastating but if you look at prices, when prices go high, when you have  inflation, it is dangerous.  So when you are saying bonds are pretty  comfortable, you are saying that there is euphoria in the bond market;  prices are very, very high; and I think it is where the bubble is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I have been talking about that since 2009 and I  will admit I have been dead wrong.  Mitch, you got a question for the  congressman?  Saying that there is euphoria in the bond market prices are  very, very high.  And I think it is.  I have been talking about that --  congressman I have been talking about that since 2009, and I will admit I  have been dead wrong.  Mitch, a question for the Congressman? </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  You are not wrong, you are not  wrong.  But you can't predict his timing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe I will be right.  I am sleeping in the dark.  Congressman,  I want Mitch to get a question for you. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  OK.  When you look at the agenda with so few days really left  in Session, where are the priorities?  Is tax reform going to sort of fall  about by way sided something we go back and reduce rates to stimulate the  economy?</p><p>PAUL:  When you say end of the session you mean for summer break? </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, correct. </p><p>PAUL:  That sort of thing? </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No.  They are not going to get that done there's too many  special interests.  They should just be cutting, spending and cutting taxes  and if you can't cut it all one time cut something.  But no.  They want the  whole package which I understand.  But it's not enough agreement.   Everybody has their ax to grind.  It's going to be hard to get them  together besides a lot of Republicans are not dedicated to what I am  talking about.  They are dedicated to taking care of their friends.  I  mean, if -- you know, it takes medical care.  They have a lot of friends in  the insurance industry, and the drug industry.  </p><p>They are not liable to change that and cut down real spending.  They will  do their talking but, Dagen, when you start cutting back it is a problem.   I mean, it is hard to get an addict off drugs and that is what we're trying  to do.  First, I don't think they start with the basic principle.  The  government ought to be very limited and strive for that.  They say  government -- we just need better management.  I don't buy into that.  I  think we have too much mismanagement. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, real quick.  Heather.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Paul, the Federal  Reserve is set to hike interest rates this Wednesday.  A quarter basis  point.  You're talking about our debt levels.  What will that effect have  on interest rates to service this debt? </p><p>PAUL:  Oh it is going to being up, supposed the market has already  discounted that, but no, if they creep up, what would happen if we had a  market rate of interest which is what we need to get economy.  What if  interest rates were three percent?  This whole worldwide system would  collapse because everything depends on more and more and more now they are  tinkering a quarter point here, a quarter point there.  They are really not  doing a whole lot so I don't think this is a trend at all.  </p><p>I think this is wishful thinking.  I think that if you go up a little bit  more even if a little bit is going to be a bigger burden on the treasury.   This is where so much production has to go eventually with increase in  interest rates, and eventually interest rates will go up, then that pay all  the production.  We cannot pay it.  We cannot pay.  We have to print more  money! </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Keep printing.  Good to see you.  Congressman Ron Paul,  take care of yourself.  </p><p>Still ahead, do they protect too much?  Stuart Varney weighs in on the  outrage after New York City play used a President Trump look-alike in the  role of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  Why analysts are going sour on  Apple.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  GE shares jumping after the company announced CEO Jeff Immelt is  leaving.  Nicole Petallides covering the story at New York Stock Exchange.   Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We have this upside this  morning for General Electric looking up about three percent right now, 3.7  percent so good move for GE who's been under pressure and overall but needs  to cut costs and outperform a little bit.  It has been under pressure.   Shareholders were not too happy with Jeff Immelt particularly Trion funds  and so he will be stepping down and John Flannery who is a 30-year veteran  there will move up to the top spot of CEO and that will happen on August  1st.  And so GE gets a pop.</p><p>Watching also Microsoft which sold off of all tech stocks on Friday but  it's come out now about the new X-Box 1x.  OK, this is supposed to be their  smallest ever X-Box 499.  Everybody is waiting for this one.  It's supposed  to have the graphics and the memory and speed, bandwidth and sound as well  to really outpace the whole industry.  And that will be available in time  for the holidays.  </p><p>And last but not least, watching Apple which sold off in a big way on  Friday.  In fact, it's biggest selloff in 14 months weighed on Dow, shaved  off 41 points on Friday, it is down again cutting it this morning but still  saying it's going to be strong for the holiday season, still liking the  iPhone but this is really evaluation call because we have seen tech stocks  really run up.  And it's not even 5 percent of the 52-week high.  Back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides in the New York  Stock Exchange.  Another controversy surrounding creative depictions of the  President.  Two sponsors, major corporations, pulling out of the  Shakespeare In The Park here in New York City after a production of Julius  Caesar shows a Donald Trump look alike being stabbed to death on the Senate  floor.  Again, it's a play.  It's Shakespeare.  So, who do we go to?   British man.  Host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY,\" Stuart.  Of course, you're  going to talk about Shakespeare this morning, my friend.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  You don't  know what to call me, do you?  You were just kind of lost there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to call you -- I was going to say, superstar. </p><p>VARNEY:  No let's not get crazy.  Look, I am picking up on what our viewers  are seeing on the left-hand side of the screen, Shakespeare in the Park.   It's really kind of pass, for New York but not voters in the rest of the  country.  I think they are appalled to see our President, a man looking  like our President being stabbed to death in Central Park for Shakespeare  in the Park.  The audience apparently just loved it.  That is New York, I  guess.  I think it is dangerous.  This comes on top of the severed head  from Kathy Griffin.  </p><p>I just think that we are leading the country in entirely the wrong  direction, leading it towards a violent confrontation between left and  right.  I don't think that is good for anybody.  But then, let's not forget  Democrat senator from New York over the weekend, dropping the \"f\" bomb in  public right there.  I have to believe that, that was focus group tried and  tested.  This is how you appeal to millennials, use obscene language.  I  think it is a dangerous situation, and I think it is something that voters  are going to reject.  That is where I am coming from. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I felt like when she said that, Stuart, it was the equivalent of  a 3-year-old making flatulent sounds.  They do it for attention. </p><p>VARNEY:  Juveniles.  The snickering going on in the audience and by her.   It is beneath the office of senator and it should not be taking place in  our country at this time.  </p><p>The level of public discourse is gone down at tubes and the level of  violence displayed against and the contempt displaced for our President  knows no bounds I think it's counterproductive for us all. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A British gentleman.  That's what I -- </p><p>VARNEY:  An American.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are.  You are you are the -- the represent greatest that is  America in terms of the opportunities that this nation provides and how you  seized upon it cherish it, I mean that Stuart, you talk about it all the  time. </p><p>VARNEY:  Well thank you very much indeed, Dagen, I appreciate that I do  thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, we'll see you in exactly 10 minutes, Stuart,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Coming up  Uber, planning to put its troubles in the rear view mirror, a key executive  reportedly resigning amid questions about the company's workplace culture  the fallout for the ride-sharing giant. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The mastermind behind terror attacks on two landmarks in Iran  last week apparently has been killed.  Cheryl Casone has details on that. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, so Dagen according to the  New York Times, the top official in Iran says that intelligence officers  hunted down and killed the man behind attacks in Iran.  ISIS said it is  behind the assault in Iran's parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah  Khomeini, the founder of Islamic Republic of course that killed 17 people  that attack while the newspaper says Iranian investigators are looking into  the attacks, increasingly focusing a on group of radicalized Iranian Kurds. </p><p>OK.  Back in here in home Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may temporarily step  aside this potential move coming on the heels of Uber's board of Directors,  adopting a series of recommendations about the company's corporate culture  from an internal investigation from former Attorney General Eric Holder.  </p><p>And a new federal audit showing that Medicare erroneously paid an estimated  $729 million to doctors and other health professionals.  The payments came  under a multibillion-dollar federal initiative to designed shift the health  care system from paper records to computers, the audit found that over  three year period Medicare improperly paid health professionals since that  they bonus payments under the initiative but in reality they either lacked  required proof or they failed to meet the criteria for the bonuses.  </p><p>And then one New Jersey couple had a surprise crasher at their wedding on  Saturday.  President Trump dropped by to congratulate Kristen Piatkowski  and Tucker Gladhill at his Bedminster golf club.  He danced with the bride,  he shook hands with the guests Trump well-known for joining wedding parties  at the resort said he runs, guess he used to run, you may recall back in  February he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped in on a wedding  reception in Mar-a-Lago.  So, you know, get married at the Bedminster in  Jersey and you'll never know who is going to show up, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So far that's pretty cool. </p><p>BLOCKS:  And Donald Trump. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes exactly, and the President of the United States doesn't  drink and so you don't need to worry about him, you know, hitting the open  bar, right?  So maybe the food tables, not the bar, coming up final  thoughts from our all-star panel. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Buckle up. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Michael Block.</p><p>BLOCK:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How many years?  </p><p>BLOCK:  A lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe. MCDOWELL:  Thanks to Heather and Michael and Mitch, see you all.  And Maria  will be back tomorrow.  She's going to interview Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin at 7 a.m. Eastern time, and then we go to the U.S. open but right  now it's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 12th.  Your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  Getting the agenda back on track, President  Trump expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin, tomorrow.  The move  comes as the White House moves past the controversy surrounding Jim Comey's  testimony last week.  First Daughter, Ivanka Trump, was asked on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" earlier about her father's response to that controversy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  My father felt very  vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels  incredibly optimistic but, you know, at the White House and throughout the  administration we were incredibly focused on the reason we all went to  Washington.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.</p><p>TRUMP:  And what we're fighting for.  So last week, while it didn't get the  level of headlines, it will ultimately have a much more important impact,  it was infrastructure week, focusing on the commitment to rebuild this  country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More from Ivanka Trump's interview ahead.  Outrage in Central  Park, a New York City play using a President Trump look-alike for the role  of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  The fallout as both Delta and Bank of  America pulled their sponsorships.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, Jeff Immelt out at General Electric.  The  company announcing earlier this morning that he will be replaced by John  Flannery as chairman and CEO.  Flannery, the current president and CEO of  G.E. Healthcare.  G.E. shares up three percent on the news, that stock down  this year, down in the last year, and down about 28 percent during Immelt's  tenure since 2001.</p><p>Futures are showing losses across the board, 34-point loss on the Dow  Futures, we keep a very close eye on what happens with technology stocks.   These big names, your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and  Microsoft had been your major market leaders, pulling the rest of the  market along all year and they took a beating on Friday and many of them  lower in premarket trading.</p><p>In Europe, stocks also heading south, we have a one percent loss in France  and in Germany.  Same story in Asia overnight, you have red across your  screen with the biggest loser there being the Hang Seng, down one and a  quarter percent.</p><p>And the Penguins putting the Predators on ice.  Pittsburgh topping  Nashville to win its second straight Stanley Cup.  The highlights from that  big win ahead.  Plus, Jimmy Carter, the president - former president taking  flight, the former leader of the free world, a video of him going viral  after he took the time to great everyone on his plane.  The presidential  surprise for passengers, the surprise being Mr. Carter was flying  commercial.  There you go.  All of that -- cancer survivor, by the way, as  well, all of that and so much more coming up.</p><p>Financial analyst, Heather Zumarraga, Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist, Michael Block, and PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle.  Good to see  you, one and all, this morning.  </p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's on your mind?  Immelt out.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEADER:  I'm interested  to see what happens with those big tech names because if they start to  continue to sell off, they're so heavy in the indices, that it could start  dragging the market down and start getting everybody worried that Trump  rally is a thing of the past.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Dated.  NASDAQ down 1.8 percent on Friday.  We'll see if we get  some follow through today to see if there's a sector rotation, as the  NASDAQ is pulling back, the Dow has been hitting new all-time highs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Russell 2000, the small-cap stocks (INAUDIBLE) a record  on Friday.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  That's a good story though.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  The Russell caught  up too.  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. </p><p>BLOCK:  Russell caught up because everyone was shorted?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Sector rotation. </p><p>BLOCK:  No, no.  It's squeezing.  Full state of rotation continues.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And the Fed is hiking this week.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  Very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I mean, take that one to the bank I think what Jon  Hilsenrath would have done.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- got lost in the headlines when you never know what happens  with Sessions' testimony.  So .</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll keep it in the headlines right here on Fox Business as we  always do.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can talk about everything.  Joining the conversation this  morning, former Texas Congressman Presidential Candidate, Ron Paul, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Mr. Stuart Varney.  We always love to see Mr.  Varney.  To our story this hour, today is the deadline for parties  challenging the president's travel ban to respond to a petition from  justice department. </p><p>The petition asks the Supreme Court to allow the president's executive  order to go into effect.  Despite opposition, Texas Attorney General Ken  Paxton says the president has the right to enact this ban.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We think we're absolutely right on the  law, there's a federal law that clearly gives the president the authority  to do this.  This travel ban is right in line with that statute.  And so,  we're confident if the court actually follows federal law, that the  president will be just fine.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is the co-founder of Diligence LLC, former CIA  Operative Mike Baker.  I don't even know where you are but I know you  parachuted in or tunneled in.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  He can't tell you where he is.  I'm at  the - I'm at the compound right now.  It's a secret - it's a secret  location except I got a picture of it behind me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why you have to - this is why you have to follow Mike on  Twitter because it's always like he's on a - like a gator boat, like a fan  boat coming in.</p><p>BAKER:  Get in your boat -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, is these bans a significant step in focusing on national  security?  </p><p>BAKER:  Well, you know, it's become this outsized thing that is chewing up  a lot of political capital and a lot of - a lot of attention and it really  didn't need to, it's important and it - and it should be done, and the  previous administration, you know, the Obama administration had identified  and outlined the same problem but because of the messaging issues, the  discipline coming out of the White House in this current administration,  it's unfortunately - it's taken on this concept that somehow the travel ban  is critical for national security.  Well, it's an element of national  security.</p><p>It is a very simple process, you've got these states, these nations that  are essentially failed states.  And the previous administration agreed and  the idea being is, well, let's take a break, let's review internally our  processes for how we -- how we do a the vetting, how we do the due  diligence, the background checking on people who want to come to this  country from these particular failed states, where there's no  infrastructure, there's no ability to reach in and in a logical and  efficient manner, check databases and talk to people to understand who are  these people that want to come in.</p><p>It's s simply that and then once you do that, fine, improve your systems  and the suspension is over.  But that's not the way it works, so it's  become this thing that like I said is just chewing up a tremendous amount  of political capital.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the same time that you have this new developing diplomatic  crisis in the Middle East with Qatar, now hiring Former Attorney General  John Ashcroft in response to accusation that the nation supports terror  groups in the region.  Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf nations cut  diplomatic ties with Qatar last week over the terror allegations, Egyptian  billionaire businessman Naguib Sawiris backing the decision on Wall Street  Week when he talked to Maria on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Tell us  why you're advising your colleagues in business to take their money out of  Qatar right now?  </p><p>NAGUIB SAWIRIS, EGYPTIAN BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN:  Well, I'm not just  advising them to take their money out to Qatar, I'm advising them not to  deal with Qatar, point, you know, because we are all watching every day, we  wake up hearing a lunatic that - or a savage person that went -- goes with  the car and kills innocent people or like in my own country here, they stop  the bus with children and women and shot the - shot the men in front of the  eyes of the women and every day we hear all these incidents, you know.</p><p>And nobody is doing anything against it and we need to come to the bottom  of that and the -- one country that declares openly that it is supporting  terror, you know, like Hamas or other organizations that's siding with Iran  openly that all intelligence services of the world have all materials  showing that they're supporting all the terrorists and extremist groups in  Middle East from Libya, in Syria, in Iraq and everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, what is this rift in Qatar mean for us because again, this  comes on the heels of Obama-backed and brokered Iranian nuclear deal.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And then - and, you know, that sound bite there, gave away  the sort of the reason why this has exploded into an issue, and it's Iran.   So this is essentially at the top line, a conflict between the Saudis and  Iran, and the Saudis, Iran obviously has their Lex Luthor and, you know,  they are locked in this battle for influence and in the region.  So the  Saudis have exerted a great deal of pressure on some of these other  countries that Egypt included to isolate Qatar.</p><p>You know, the truth of the matter is that, you know, they're all complicit  in different ways over different periods of time and either financing or  somehow supporting or looking the other way in terms of Islamic extremism.   So Qatar doesn't stand alone in that and what needs to happen and what's  going to be extremely difficult is, you know, the U.S. in particular, we're  going to need to find a way to step into that breach and bring them back  together in a fashion because we're not going to - we're not going to do  this, we're not going to beat terrorism by isolating Qatar.</p><p>You know, we've got a military base there, and different things can be true  at the same time in Middle East.  You can be working with a partner out  there who on one hand, at a one side of their mouth helps you with certain  terrorist operations or providing intelligence, to us and our liaise on  partners, at the same time there can be elements within that government  that sympathize or support terrorism or business that do same thing.  You  got, you know, you got to deal with, you know, the world is that exists and  not try to find some perfect ending.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Mike, Mitch Roschelle, with all those Sunni-Shia conflict  that's going on, doesn't Iran just need trading partners and maybe they  were looking to make a friend in Qatar because there's so many players in  the region that just will trade with them and they need trading partners?</p><p>BAKER:  Well, sure, they like as many trading partners as possible but, you  know, over the top of that is the fact that Iran is doing it for the  regime's best interest which is to drive a wedge between these countries  and to try to degree possible to pull them out of the Saudi sphere.  Again,  this is - this is a Saudi-Iranian dispute.  I wouldn't ascribe any sort of  innocent economic reasoning behind anything that the Iranian regime does.</p><p>So I think - I think your take on it, while there is an element of economic  truth there, the reality is it's more nefarious than that.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Mike, what's the - what's the endgame for Qatar here?  Because  they've been very Machiavellian I would say, they play from both sides,  they're friends with everybody that have Al-Jazeera, you know (INAUDIBLE)  they deal with Iran, they were dealing with the west - we have the big base  there, you know, it sounds like probably they're getting called on playing  both sides here.  How does this end for them?  Is there something that  taunts where that continues or is the line drawn and they have to choose a  side or have a side chosen for them?  </p><p>BAKER:  No.  I don't think it's going to be a hardline decision at the end  where they, you know, that's it, there's a final break from, you know, from  the -- sort of this traditional alliance where, you know, to some degree  they have been aligned with UAE and Egypt and the others, and Saudis.  I  think what will happen is -- I hope what will happen is that there will be  a significant diplomatic effort led by Rex Tillerson and some others.</p><p>And at the end of the day, we'll heal the rift to some degree, they'll open  the borders, there will be business but we have to be pragmatic and  understand that, you know, again, there will be this duplicity that exists,  so that's not just - again, it's not just Qatar.  I mean, look at the  Saudis in the way over the time they dealt with the devil, they've turned  the other way and in terms of allowing the extremism to build in exchange  for, you know, stability within the kingdom.</p><p>So, you know, the Middle East is one of those places where, you know, it's  on satisfactory but you have to deal with who exists there and you have to  understand it would be very, very hard line pragmatic about this to  understand that they're going to be duplicities in the way that they act  when it comes to extremism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, when you leave, do you ignite your jet propulsion pack  since why you're sitting in the state.  Why right out? </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.  We tend to - everything disappears, you know, it's a  little bit like Mr. Wolfe, you know, you got to clean the place up and then  you go and, you know, and you find another place where we can do another  segment.  But yes, it's - it is what it is.  Look, I'm out in Idaho, I'm  going to release that information to the public, I was going to give it to  a friend and then you're going to hand it the press but I'm in Idaho, and  anybody out there watching hasn't been to Idaho, I'm here to tell you, it's  one of the greatest states in the nation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really is.  It is stunningly beautiful but I would deeply,  deeply appreciate your Winston Wolfe reference.  </p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Baker.  Big love always.  Mike Baker joining us.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A scare in the air for flyers aboard at flight to  Shanghai, a plane forced to turn around after a hole rips open in the  engine.  And a shake-up at the top of General Electric, Jeff Immelt out.   We look at future of this company because the road since he took over in  '01 was a lo rocky one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news this morning.  General Electric getting a new  leader.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey Dagen,  that's right.  G.E. CEO Jeff Immelt is retiring, he's ending a 16-year run  as the leader of industrial conglomerate.  He's going to be replaced by  John Flannery in August who's currently the president and CEO of G.E.  Healthcare.  Now, the possible move first reported by our very ow3n Charlie  Gasparino.  He broke that news on the tensions between Immelt and activist  investor Nelson Peltz.</p><p>That report from Charlie - excuse me, was back in March.  General Electric  says Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the  year.  Flannery going to take on that title, January 1st.  Immelt has taken  steps to reship - reshape G.E. after the financial crisis for the company.   They have struggled a boost profit there.  As you can see, there is the  stock in the premarket, it is rallying.  G.E. shares are rallying up a  little more than three percent.  That will actually help balance out the  Dow when we open up at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.  </p><p>Also, we're following this story for you.  A huge hole in a China Eastern  plane forced an emergency landing in Australia.  Passengers of the flight  from the city to Shanghai said the engine made a massive amount of noise  right after takeoff.  Pilots reported problems about an hour into the  journey.  The plane had to return to Sydney, it land safely.  Passengers  were evacuated from plane but luckily, there were no injuries there.</p><p>Well, a Trump t-shirt censored in a high school yearbook.  Grant Berardo  took his high school pictures in New Jersey wearing Trump campaign shirt,  this is Make America Great Again but the t-shirt was later digitally  altered to remove the campaign slogan in the actual yearbook.  The school  superintendent is investigating this, says there is no policy prohibiting  political messages in schools pictures.</p><p>And then this, passengers on a recent Delta Airlines flight got a big  surprise.  Former President Jimmy Carter was on board and before the plane  took off, he walked up and down the aisle shook hands with passengers.   They were really excited.  There you go.  This is the tweeted video shows  the 92-year-old former president smiling as he walked down the aisle.  He  greets everybody.  The passenger tweeted the video, said, everybody seemed  really excited.  And the overall sense it was just really nice to have that  kind of moment where party or politics \"Didn't matter.\"  One of the most --  I think revered ex-presidents we have living today, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) but a cancer survivor, you know, he went on one of  these Immunotherapy drugs from the Kansas spread to his brain spectacular  until -</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  And look at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Spectacular --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- recovery.  I wish the president talked more about that  actually.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up.  The Penguins iced the  Predators to keep the cup in Pittsburg.  Highlights from the repeat NHL  title victory in nearly 20 years.</p><p>And bling with a zing, how to Patriots are using their Super Bowl reign to  remind the Falcons off their incredible comeback in February.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The hockey season coming to a close after an exciting Stanley  Cup final between the Penguins the Predators.  Jared Max is here with the  highlights.  Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 AMERICAN SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.   I thought we were headed for sudden death overtime last night.  0-0 game  until under two minutes remaining.  Game six Stanley Cup final in  Nashville, the Predators fans continue their tradition, throwing catfish on  the ice and it looked like the Predators had reeled in the first goal of  the game.  Colton Sissons taps it in after Pittsburg goalie Matt Murray was  unable to control Filip Forsberg's shot.  1-0 Predators, right?  Wrong!</p><p>Officials had lost sight of the puck and one blew a whistle to signal the  play dead, fraction of a second before the puck went in.  0-0 to the third  and then the Penguins get this weird goal from behind the net, the former  Predator Patric Hornqvist sneaks it past Pekka Rinne, this goal counted.   Penguins 1-0, a minute later they scored through an empty net.  Celebration  was on a first time in era of salary cap.  One team wins the Stanley Cup  two straight seasons.  Penguins' parade will be this week.  No official  date yet.</p><p>Could be preparing for another championship parade and NBA one for the  Golden State Warriors soon.  Warriors up three games to one and the  Cavaliers favored to win tonight by 8.5 points, tip off scheduled for just  after 9:00 Eastern in Oakland.  We all know Air Jordans are not cheap  sneakers but what about a pair of real about Michael Jordans?  As in sneaks  worn by the basketball legend in his final game as an amateur.  Well, the  sneakers that Jordan wore in the gold medal game in the '84 Olympics at  Spain sold at auction yesterday for $190,373.  Almost 200 grand.  Yes,  highest known price paid for game-worn shoes.  I even had Jordans orthotics  and the autograph.</p><p>Back page of the New York Post today asks the question, he hit it how far?   New York Yankees star Aaron Judge, longest homerun in Major League Baseball  since ESPN began tracking distance of homeruns in 2009.  Watch this.  Now  Judge hit two homeruns in the Yankees 14-3 win over Orioles.  This was his  first.  It traveled 4696 feet.  He is first Yankees since Mickey Mantle in  1956 two hit homers in the same game, he goes four for four, first Yankees  since Roger Maris, age 25 or younger to hit 20 homeruns before the all-star  break.  Judge has 21, he's batting 344. </p><p>Football.  You know, football said to be the sport of kings, better than  diamond rings but maybe not this ring.  Check this out, past Friday night;  New England Patriots owner Robert Craft hosted a private ceremony for his  players and team members at his home.  Well, they all got their  championship rings.  Remember that 28 to 3 comeback against the Atlanta  Falcons in Super Bowl?  So, 283 rings to recognize the 28 to 3 comeback.   283 diamonds are on this ring, it totals 5.1 carats.  And all Tom Brady  showing it off along with Martellus Bennett.  So they have a 28 to 3, a  little bit of a dig at the Falcons and also a couple of quotes on the  rings, as well from Bob Craft, the team owner, unequivocally the sweetest  and also greatest comeback all-time.  How about those rings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't wear them all at the same time.  </p><p>BLOCK:  It should have had two big diamonds on them to represent the two  times they couldn't beat the Giants in Super Bowl.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  I like that.  I like that.  That's fair.  It's a good shot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dropping the mic on that one, Mike.  Dropping the mic, Mike.

Blake Burman at the White House with more.  Good  morning, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Dagen.  Good morning to you as well.  Last week at the White House was  infrastructure week at a rollout.  It got a bit muddled once Jim Comey  headed to Capitol Hill.  This week, they have got a new focus somewhat of a  round two.  They will be focusing on workforce development.  The main push  here according to top officials, at the White House, is on trying to build  out apprenticeship to that end.  The President will be headed on the road  this week, tomorrow, he will be going to Wisconsin, speaking at a trade  school in Waukesha, Wednesday to Labor Department, Thursday, here at the  White House.  </p><p>He has a roundtable with several state governors.  This whole issue of  workforce development has been a push of Ivanka Trump.  She was on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" this morning to tout rollout administration will be having  throughout the week and she admitted that there has been -- as she put it a  level of visual viciousness in Washington, that caught her off guard. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER:  I didn't expect it to be easy.   I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was -- I was a  little blindsided by on a personal level. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this workforce development roll  out, Dagen, Friday sources tell Fox that the President will end his  workweek in Miami where he will unveil his administration's policies as it  relates to Cuba.  You can expect at least somewhat of a rollback of the  Obama administration policies to that end.</p><p>By the way, later today here at the White House, the start off to the week  the President will have a full cabinet meeting.  All the members of his  cabinet.  Dagen, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for covering all that for us.  Blake Burman at  the White House.  Joining us now is former Texas Congressman and Republican  Presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul.  Congressman, the President is set to  hold -- Blake mentioned, first full cabinet meeting today.  Do you think  this administration will now be able to move forward on the agenda that  Americans want the reason they voted for him? </p><p>RON PAUL, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN:  It is not likely but let's hope they  move forward on right things because everything they say is not exactly  going to solve all our problems.  I don't happen to believe public works  projects is a way to get more jobs.  You might get more jobs but it won't  be same as if you got more jobs in private sector.  They make a lot of  mistakes.  I think obstacles are so great and people don't recognize the  debt.  When you have a lot of debt, it's hard to spend money.  You come up  with a trillion dollars for military and a trillion dollars for public  works and repairing highways, where is the money going to come from?  And  this has an effect at marketplaces eventually.  If you look at how much  debt is out there whether it's automobile debt, college debt, personal debt  and even housing debt right now, I mean, there is a lot of problems so that  is why I think they are stymied because the fundamentals don't change.  You  can say these jobs -- the truth is dependent on government creating jobs or  there's something wrong with the plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I am going to push back in terms of the  infrastructure plan and I will and you call it public works.  I come on  that I know that means you mean to evoke FDR's programs of the depression. </p><p>PAUL:  I do, I do. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is what you say it but trillion dollars is not going to be  -- actually a minority of it would be government money.  Under the way, the  plan is laid out now.  They would -- Trump administration would get to  trillion largely in parts from funding through private investors and the  money is indeed out there.  It was $59 billion raised last year in private  infrastructure funds.  Their goal is too easy the permitting process, easy  regulations to get that money invested in projects alongside the  government. </p><p>PAUL:  Yes.  The easing of regulations is very good and that is getting out  of the way house in order, but this whole thing is partnership that bothers  libertarians because partnerships, big businesses big banks in government  isn't exactly what a free society is all about.  That is not what a  Republic is about because only favored people get to do the dealing.  So I  don't like partnership.  I want an environment where people can be  competitive and produce things that are necessary.  But saying that we are  going to have big government financing and big business financing, there is  a lot of shortcomings with that plan. </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Dr. Paul, Mike  Block here.  You raised a very valid concerns about debt levels and  something people worry about except, I don't want to turn into a discussion  on bond market, the bond yields are not reflecting a lot of concern about  all this spending that you are talking about.  The capital markets have  this wrong?  Is there something else going on here? </p><p>PAUL:  Yes.  I think they do.  I am not an investor but just from an  economic viewpoint, I do.  You might have said tech stocks were good  investment and things happen in a flash and bond markets can happen that  way too, because all countries are in debt, and you know we have the  European problem where you have Greece, and Italy, and Spain having  problems but you are going to have something pop up.  It's going to be very  devastating but if you look at prices, when prices go high, when you have  inflation, it is dangerous.  So when you are saying bonds are pretty  comfortable, you are saying that there is euphoria in the bond market;  prices are very, very high; and I think it is where the bubble is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I have been talking about that since 2009 and I  will admit I have been dead wrong.  Mitch, you got a question for the  congressman?  Saying that there is euphoria in the bond market prices are  very, very high.  And I think it is.  I have been talking about that --  congressman I have been talking about that since 2009, and I will admit I  have been dead wrong.  Mitch, a question for the Congressman? </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  You are not wrong, you are not  wrong.  But you can't predict his timing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe I will be right.  I am sleeping in the dark.  Congressman,  I want Mitch to get a question for you. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  OK.  When you look at the agenda with so few days really left  in Session, where are the priorities?  Is tax reform going to sort of fall  about by way sided something we go back and reduce rates to stimulate the  economy?</p><p>PAUL:  When you say end of the session you mean for summer break? </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, correct. </p><p>PAUL:  That sort of thing? </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No.  They are not going to get that done there's too many  special interests.  They should just be cutting, spending and cutting taxes  and if you can't cut it all one time cut something.  But no.  They want the  whole package which I understand.  But it's not enough agreement.   Everybody has their ax to grind.  It's going to be hard to get them  together besides a lot of Republicans are not dedicated to what I am  talking about.  They are dedicated to taking care of their friends.  I  mean, if -- you know, it takes medical care.  They have a lot of friends in  the insurance industry, and the drug industry.  </p><p>They are not liable to change that and cut down real spending.  They will  do their talking but, Dagen, when you start cutting back it is a problem.   I mean, it is hard to get an addict off drugs and that is what we're trying  to do.  First, I don't think they start with the basic principle.  The  government ought to be very limited and strive for that.  They say  government -- we just need better management.  I don't buy into that.  I  think we have too much mismanagement. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, real quick.  Heather.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Paul, the Federal  Reserve is set to hike interest rates this Wednesday.  A quarter basis  point.  You're talking about our debt levels.  What will that effect have  on interest rates to service this debt? </p><p>PAUL:  Oh it is going to being up, supposed the market has already  discounted that, but no, if they creep up, what would happen if we had a  market rate of interest which is what we need to get economy.  What if  interest rates were three percent?  This whole worldwide system would  collapse because everything depends on more and more and more now they are  tinkering a quarter point here, a quarter point there.  They are really not  doing a whole lot so I don't think this is a trend at all.  </p><p>I think this is wishful thinking.  I think that if you go up a little bit  more even if a little bit is going to be a bigger burden on the treasury.   This is where so much production has to go eventually with increase in  interest rates, and eventually interest rates will go up, then that pay all  the production.  We cannot pay it.  We cannot pay.  We have to print more  money! </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Keep printing.  Good to see you.  Congressman Ron Paul,  take care of yourself.  </p><p>Still ahead, do they protect too much?  Stuart Varney weighs in on the  outrage after New York City play used a President Trump look-alike in the  role of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  Why analysts are going sour on  Apple.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  GE shares jumping after the company announced CEO Jeff Immelt is  leaving.  Nicole Petallides covering the story at New York Stock Exchange.   Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We have this upside this  morning for General Electric looking up about three percent right now, 3.7  percent so good move for GE who's been under pressure and overall but needs  to cut costs and outperform a little bit.  It has been under pressure.   Shareholders were not too happy with Jeff Immelt particularly Trion funds  and so he will be stepping down and John Flannery who is a 30-year veteran  there will move up to the top spot of CEO and that will happen on August  1st.  And so GE gets a pop.</p><p>Watching also Microsoft which sold off of all tech stocks on Friday but  it's come out now about the new X-Box 1x.  OK, this is supposed to be their  smallest ever X-Box 499.  Everybody is waiting for this one.  It's supposed  to have the graphics and the memory and speed, bandwidth and sound as well  to really outpace the whole industry.  And that will be available in time  for the holidays.  </p><p>And last but not least, watching Apple which sold off in a big way on  Friday.  In fact, it's biggest selloff in 14 months weighed on Dow, shaved  off 41 points on Friday, it is down again cutting it this morning but still  saying it's going to be strong for the holiday season, still liking the  iPhone but this is really evaluation call because we have seen tech stocks  really run up.  And it's not even 5 percent of the 52-week high.  Back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides in the New York  Stock Exchange.  Another controversy surrounding creative depictions of the  President.  Two sponsors, major corporations, pulling out of the  Shakespeare In The Park here in New York City after a production of Julius  Caesar shows a Donald Trump look alike being stabbed to death on the Senate  floor.  Again, it's a play.  It's Shakespeare.  So, who do we go to?   British man.  Host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY,\" Stuart.  Of course, you're  going to talk about Shakespeare this morning, my friend.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  You don't  know what to call me, do you?  You were just kind of lost there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to call you -- I was going to say, superstar. </p><p>VARNEY:  No let's not get crazy.  Look, I am picking up on what our viewers  are seeing on the left-hand side of the screen, Shakespeare in the Park.   It's really kind of pass, for New York but not voters in the rest of the  country.  I think they are appalled to see our President, a man looking  like our President being stabbed to death in Central Park for Shakespeare  in the Park.  The audience apparently just loved it.  That is New York, I  guess.  I think it is dangerous.  This comes on top of the severed head  from Kathy Griffin.  </p><p>I just think that we are leading the country in entirely the wrong  direction, leading it towards a violent confrontation between left and  right.  I don't think that is good for anybody.  But then, let's not forget  Democrat senator from New York over the weekend, dropping the \"f\" bomb in  public right there.  I have to believe that, that was focus group tried and  tested.  This is how you appeal to millennials, use obscene language.  I  think it is a dangerous situation, and I think it is something that voters  are going to reject.  That is where I am coming from. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I felt like when she said that, Stuart, it was the equivalent of  a 3-year-old making flatulent sounds.  They do it for attention. </p><p>VARNEY:  Juveniles.  The snickering going on in the audience and by her.   It is beneath the office of senator and it should not be taking place in  our country at this time.  </p><p>The level of public discourse is gone down at tubes and the level of  violence displayed against and the contempt displaced for our President  knows no bounds I think it's counterproductive for us all. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A British gentleman.  That's what I -- </p><p>VARNEY:  An American.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are.  You are you are the -- the represent greatest that is  America in terms of the opportunities that this nation provides and how you  seized upon it cherish it, I mean that Stuart, you talk about it all the  time. </p><p>VARNEY:  Well thank you very much indeed, Dagen, I appreciate that I do  thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, we'll see you in exactly 10 minutes, Stuart,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Coming up  Uber, planning to put its troubles in the rear view mirror, a key executive  reportedly resigning amid questions about the company's workplace culture  the fallout for the ride-sharing giant. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The mastermind behind terror attacks on two landmarks in Iran  last week apparently has been killed.  Cheryl Casone has details on that. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, so Dagen according to the  New York Times, the top official in Iran says that intelligence officers  hunted down and killed the man behind attacks in Iran.  ISIS said it is  behind the assault in Iran's parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah  Khomeini, the founder of Islamic Republic of course that killed 17 people  that attack while the newspaper says Iranian investigators are looking into  the attacks, increasingly focusing a on group of radicalized Iranian Kurds. </p><p>OK.  Back in here in home Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may temporarily step  aside this potential move coming on the heels of Uber's board of Directors,  adopting a series of recommendations about the company's corporate culture  from an internal investigation from former Attorney General Eric Holder.  </p><p>And a new federal audit showing that Medicare erroneously paid an estimated  $729 million to doctors and other health professionals.  The payments came  under a multibillion-dollar federal initiative to designed shift the health  care system from paper records to computers, the audit found that over  three year period Medicare improperly paid health professionals since that  they bonus payments under the initiative but in reality they either lacked  required proof or they failed to meet the criteria for the bonuses.  </p><p>And then one New Jersey couple had a surprise crasher at their wedding on  Saturday.  President Trump dropped by to congratulate Kristen Piatkowski  and Tucker Gladhill at his Bedminster golf club.  He danced with the bride,  he shook hands with the guests Trump well-known for joining wedding parties  at the resort said he runs, guess he used to run, you may recall back in  February he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped in on a wedding  reception in Mar-a-Lago.  So, you know, get married at the Bedminster in  Jersey and you'll never know who is going to show up, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So far that's pretty cool. </p><p>BLOCKS:  And Donald Trump. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes exactly, and the President of the United States doesn't  drink and so you don't need to worry about him, you know, hitting the open  bar, right?  So maybe the food tables, not the bar, coming up final  thoughts from our all-star panel. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Buckle up. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Michael Block.</p><p>BLOCK:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How many years?  </p><p>BLOCK:  A lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe. MCDOWELL:  Thanks to Heather and Michael and Mitch, see you all.  And Maria  will be back tomorrow.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It's Monday, June 12th. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Getting the agenda back on track, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin, tomorrow. The move comes as the White House moves past the controversy surrounding Jim Comey's testimony last week. First Daughter, <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump, </nameText></person>was asked on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" earlier about her father's response to that controversy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>IVANKA TRUMP, </nameText></person>DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: My father felt very vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels incredibly optimistic but, you know, at the White House and throughout the administration we were incredibly focused on the reason we all went to Washington.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>TRUMP: And what we're fighting for. So last week, while it didn't get the level of headlines, it will ultimately have a much more important impact, it was infrastructure week, focusing on the commitment to rebuild this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: More from <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump's </nameText></person>interview ahead. Outrage in Central Park, a New York City play using a <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>look-alike for the role of the assassinated Julius Caesar. The fallout as both Delta and Bank of America pulled their sponsorships.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt </nameText></person>out at General Electric. The company announcing earlier this morning that he will be replaced by <person><nameText>John Flannery </nameText></person>as chairman and CEO. Flannery, the current president and CEO of G.E. Healthcare. G.E. shares up three percent on the news, that stock down this year, down in the last year, and down about 28 percent during Immelt's tenure since 2001.</p><p>Futures are showing losses across the board, 34-point loss on the Dow Futures, we keep a very close eye on what happens with technology stocks. These big names, your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and Microsoft had been your major market leaders, pulling the rest of the market along all year and they took a beating on Friday and many of them lower in premarket trading.</p><p>In Europe, stocks also heading south, we have a one percent loss in France and in Germany. Same story in Asia overnight, you have red across your screen with the biggest loser there being the Hang Seng, down one and a quarter percent.</p><p>And the Penguins putting the Predators on ice. Pittsburgh topping Nashville to win its second straight Stanley Cup. The highlights from that big win ahead. Plus, <person><nameText>Jimmy Carter, </nameText></person>the president - former president taking flight, the former leader of the free world, a video of him going viral after he took the time to great everyone on his plane. The presidential surprise for passengers, the surprise being Mr. Carter was flying commercial. There you go. All of that -- cancer survivor, by the way, as well, all of that and so much more coming up.</p><p>Financial analyst, Heather Zumarraga, Rhino Trading Partners Chief Strategist, Michael Block, and PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle. Good to see you, one and all, this morning.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT: Good morning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's on your mind? Immelt out.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEADER: I'm interested to see what happens with those big tech names because if they start to continue to sell off, they're so heavy in the indices, that it could start dragging the market down and start getting everybody worried that Trump rally is a thing of the past.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Dated. NASDAQ down 1.8 percent on Friday. We'll see if we get some follow through today to see if there's a sector rotation, as the NASDAQ is pulling back, the Dow has been hitting new all-time highs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Russell 2000, the small-cap stocks (INAUDIBLE) a record on Friday.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE: That's a good story though.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST: The Russell caught up too. Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BLOCK: Russell caught up because everyone was shorted?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sector rotation.</p><p>BLOCK: No, no. It's squeezing. Full state of rotation continues.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And the Fed is hiking this week.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes. Very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I mean, take that one to the bank I think what Jon Hilsenrath would have done.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE: -- got lost in the headlines when you never know what happens with Sessions' testimony. So .</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll keep it in the headlines right here on Fox Business as we always do.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We can talk about everything. Joining the conversation this morning, former Texas Congressman Presidential Candidate, Ron Paul, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Mr. Stuart Varney. We always love to see Mr. Varney. To our story this hour, today is the deadline for parties challenging the president's travel ban to respond to a petition from justice department.</p><p>The petition asks the Supreme Court to allow the president's executive order to go into effect. Despite opposition, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says the president has the right to enact this ban. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL: We think we're absolutely right on the law, there's a federal law that clearly gives the president the authority to do this. This travel ban is right in line with that statute. And so, we're confident if the court actually follows federal law, that the president will be just fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining me now is the co-founder of Diligence LLC, former CIA Operative Mike Baker. I don't even know where you are but I know you parachuted in or tunneled in.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE: He can't tell you where he is. I'm at the - I'm at the compound right now. It's a secret - it's a secret location except I got a picture of it behind me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is why you have to - this is why you have to follow Mike on Twitter because it's always like he's on a - like a gator boat, like a fan boat coming in.</p><p>BAKER: Get in your boat --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, is these bans a significant step in focusing on national security?</p><p>BAKER: Well, you know, it's become this outsized thing that is chewing up a lot of political capital and a lot of - a lot of attention and it really didn't need to, it's important and it - and it should be done, and the previous administration, you know, the Obama administration had identified and outlined the same problem but because of the messaging issues, the discipline coming out of the White House in this current administration, it's unfortunately - it's taken on this concept that somehow the travel ban is critical for national security. Well, it's an element of national security.</p><p>It is a very simple process, you've got these states, these nations that are essentially failed states. And the previous administration agreed and the idea being is, well, let's take a break, let's review internally our processes for how we -- how we do a the vetting, how we do the due diligence, the background checking on people who want to come to this country from these particular failed states, where there's no infrastructure, there's no ability to reach in and in a logical and efficient manner, check databases and talk to people to understand who are these people that want to come in.</p><p>It's s simply that and then once you do that, fine, improve your systems and the suspension is over. But that's not the way it works, so it's become this thing that like I said is just chewing up a tremendous amount of political capital.</p><p>MCDOWELL: At the same time that you have this new developing diplomatic crisis in the Middle East with Qatar, now hiring Former Attorney General John Ashcroft in response to accusation that the nation supports terror groups in the region. Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf nations cut diplomatic ties with Qatar last week over the terror allegations, Egyptian billionaire businessman Naguib Sawiris backing the decision on Wall Street Week when he talked to Maria on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MARIA BARTIROMO, </nameText></person>FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST: Tell us why you're advising your colleagues in business to take their money out of Qatar right now?</p><p>NAGUIB SAWIRIS, EGYPTIAN BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN: Well, I'm not just advising them to take their money out to Qatar, I'm advising them not to deal with Qatar, point, you know, because we are all watching every day, we wake up hearing a lunatic that - or a savage person that went -- goes with the car and kills innocent people or like in my own country here, they stop the bus with children and women and shot the - shot the men in front of the eyes of the women and every day we hear all these incidents, you know.</p><p>And nobody is doing anything against it and we need to come to the bottom of that and the -- one country that declares openly that it is supporting terror, you know, like Hamas or other organizations that's siding with Iran openly that all intelligence services of the world have all materials showing that they're supporting all the terrorists and extremist groups in Middle East from Libya, in Syria, in Iraq and everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, what is this rift in Qatar mean for us because again, this comes on the heels of Obama-backed and brokered Iranian nuclear deal.</p><p>BAKER: Yes. And then - and, you know, that sound bite there, gave away the sort of the reason why this has exploded into an issue, and it's Iran. So this is essentially at the top line, a conflict between the Saudis and Iran, and the Saudis, Iran obviously has their Lex Luthor and, you know, they are locked in this battle for influence and in the region. So the Saudis have exerted a great deal of pressure on some of these other countries that Egypt included to isolate Qatar.</p><p>You know, the truth of the matter is that, you know, they're all complicit in different ways over different periods of time and either financing or somehow supporting or looking the other way in terms of Islamic extremism. So Qatar doesn't stand alone in that and what needs to happen and what's going to be extremely difficult is, you know, the U.S. in particular, we're going to need to find a way to step into that breach and bring them back together in a fashion because we're not going to - we're not going to do this, we're not going to beat terrorism by isolating Qatar.</p><p>You know, we've got a military base there, and different things can be true at the same time in Middle East. You can be working with a partner out there who on one hand, at a one side of their mouth helps you with certain terrorist operations or providing intelligence, to us and our liaise on partners, at the same time there can be elements within that government that sympathize or support terrorism or business that do same thing. You got, you know, you got to deal with, you know, the world is that exists and not try to find some perfect ending.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And Mike, Mitch Roschelle, with all those Sunni-Shia conflict that's going on, doesn't Iran just need trading partners and maybe they were looking to make a friend in Qatar because there's so many players in the region that just will trade with them and they need trading partners?</p><p>BAKER: Well, sure, they like as many trading partners as possible but, you know, over the top of that is the fact that Iran is doing it for the regime's best interest which is to drive a wedge between these countries and to try to degree possible to pull them out of the Saudi sphere. Again, this is - this is a Saudi-Iranian dispute. I wouldn't ascribe any sort of innocent economic reasoning behind anything that the Iranian regime does.</p><p>So I think - I think your take on it, while there is an element of economic truth there, the reality is it's more nefarious than that.</p><p>BLOCK: Mike, what's the - what's the endgame for Qatar here? Because they've been very Machiavellian I would say, they play from both sides, they're friends with everybody that have Al-Jazeera, you know (INAUDIBLE) they deal with Iran, they were dealing with the west - we have the big base there, you know, it sounds like probably they're getting called on playing both sides here. How does this end for them? Is there something that taunts where that continues or is the line drawn and they have to choose a side or have a side chosen for them?</p><p>BAKER: No. I don't think it's going to be a hardline decision at the end where they, you know, that's it, there's a final break from, you know, from the -- sort of this traditional alliance where, you know, to some degree they have been aligned with UAE and Egypt and the others, and Saudis. I think what will happen is -- I hope what will happen is that there will be a significant diplomatic effort led by <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>and some others.</p><p>And at the end of the day, we'll heal the rift to some degree, they'll open the borders, there will be business but we have to be pragmatic and understand that, you know, again, there will be this duplicity that exists, so that's not just - again, it's not just Qatar. I mean, look at the Saudis in the way over the time they dealt with the devil, they've turned the other way and in terms of allowing the extremism to build in exchange for, you know, stability within the kingdom.</p><p>So, you know, the Middle East is one of those places where, you know, it's on satisfactory but you have to deal with who exists there and you have to understand it would be very, very hard line pragmatic about this to understand that they're going to be duplicities in the way that they act when it comes to extremism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, when you leave, do you ignite your jet propulsion pack since why you're sitting in the state. Why right out?</p><p>BAKER: Yes. Yes. We tend to - everything disappears, you know, it's a little bit like Mr. Wolfe, you know, you got to clean the place up and then you go and, you know, and you find another place where we can do another segment. But yes, it's - it is what it is. Look, I'm out in Idaho, I'm going to release that information to the public, I was going to give it to a friend and then you're going to hand it the press but I'm in Idaho, and anybody out there watching hasn't been to Idaho, I'm here to tell you, it's one of the greatest states in the nation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It really is. It is stunningly beautiful but I would deeply, deeply appreciate your Winston Wolfe reference.</p><p>BAKER: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike Baker. Big love always. Mike Baker joining us.</p><p>BAKER: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up. A scare in the air for flyers aboard at flight to Shanghai, a plane forced to turn around after a hole rips open in the engine. And a shake-up at the top of General Electric, <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt </nameText></person>out. We look at future of this company because the road since he took over in `01 was a lo rocky one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news this morning. General Electric getting a new leader. Cheryl Casone has the details. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR: Hey Dagen, that's right. G.E. CEO <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt </nameText></person>is retiring, he's ending a 16-year run as the leader of industrial conglomerate. He's going to be replaced by <person><nameText>John Flannery </nameText></person>in August who's currently the president and CEO of G.E. Healthcare. Now, the possible move first reported by our very ow3n Charlie Gasparino. He broke that news on the tensions between Immelt and activist investor Nelson Peltz.</p><p>That report from Charlie - excuse me, was back in March. General Electric says Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the year. Flannery going to take on that title, January 1st. Immelt has taken steps to reship - reshape G.E. after the financial crisis for the company. They have struggled a boost profit there. As you can see, there is the stock in the premarket, it is rallying. G.E. shares are rallying up a little more than three percent. That will actually help balance out the Dow when we open up at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.</p><p>Also, we're following this story for you. A huge hole in a China Eastern plane forced an emergency landing in Australia. Passengers of the flight from the city to Shanghai said the engine made a massive amount of noise right after takeoff. Pilots reported problems about an hour into the journey. The plane had to return to Sydney, it land safely. Passengers were evacuated from plane but luckily, there were no injuries there.</p><p>Well, a Trump t-shirt censored in a high school yearbook. Grant Berardo took his high school pictures in New Jersey wearing Trump campaign shirt, this is Make America Great Again but the t-shirt was later digitally altered to remove the campaign slogan in the actual yearbook. The school superintendent is investigating this, says there is no policy prohibiting political messages in schools pictures.</p><p>And then this, passengers on a recent Delta Airlines flight got a big surprise. Former President <person><nameText>Jimmy Carter </nameText></person>was on board and before the plane took off, he walked up and down the aisle shook hands with passengers. They were really excited. There you go. This is the tweeted video shows the 92-year-old former president smiling as he walked down the aisle. He greets everybody. The passenger tweeted the video, said, everybody seemed really excited. And the overall sense it was just really nice to have that kind of moment where party or politics \"Didn't matter.\" One of the most -- I think revered ex-presidents we have living today, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) but a cancer survivor, you know, he went on one of these Immunotherapy drugs from the Kansas spread to his brain spectacular until -</p><p>CASONE: Uh-hmm. And look at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Spectacular --</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- recovery. I wish the president talked more about that actually. Thank you so much, Cheryl. Coming up. The Penguins iced the Predators to keep the cup in Pittsburg. Highlights from the repeat NHL title victory in nearly 20 years.</p><p>And bling with a zing, how to Patriots are using their Super Bowl reign to remind the Falcons off their incredible comeback in February.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The hockey season coming to a close after an exciting Stanley Cup final between the Penguins the Predators. Jared Max is here with the highlights. Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 AMERICAN SPORTS REPORTER: Hey, Dagen. I thought we were headed for sudden death overtime last night. 0-0 game until under two minutes remaining. Game six Stanley Cup final in Nashville, the Predators fans continue their tradition, throwing catfish on the ice and it looked like the Predators had reeled in the first goal of the game. Colton Sissons taps it in after Pittsburg goalie Matt Murray was unable to control Filip Forsberg's shot. 1-0 Predators, right? Wrong!</p><p>Officials had lost sight of the puck and one blew a whistle to signal the play dead, fraction of a second before the puck went in. 0-0 to the third and then the Penguins get this weird goal from behind the net, the former Predator Patric Hornqvist sneaks it past Pekka Rinne, this goal counted. Penguins 1-0, a minute later they scored through an empty net. Celebration was on a first time in era of salary cap. One team wins the Stanley Cup two straight seasons. Penguins' parade will be this week. No official date yet.</p><p>Could be preparing for another championship parade and NBA one for the Golden State Warriors soon. Warriors up three games to one and the Cavaliers favored to win tonight by 8.5 points, tip off scheduled for just after 9:00 Eastern in Oakland. We all know Air Jordans are not cheap sneakers but what about a pair of real about Michael Jordans? As in sneaks worn by the basketball legend in his final game as an amateur. Well, the sneakers that Jordan wore in the gold medal game in the `84 Olympics at Spain sold at auction yesterday for $190,373. Almost 200 grand. Yes, highest known price paid for game-worn shoes. I even had Jordans orthotics and the autograph.</p><p>Back page of the New York Post today asks the question, he hit it how far? New York Yankees star Aaron Judge, longest homerun in Major League Baseball since ESPN began tracking distance of homeruns in 2009. Watch this. Now Judge hit two homeruns in the Yankees 14-3 win over Orioles. This was his first. It traveled 4696 feet. He is first Yankees since Mickey Mantle in 1956 two hit homers in the same game, he goes four for four, first Yankees since Roger Maris, age 25 or younger to hit 20 homeruns before the all-star break. Judge has 21, he's batting 344.</p><p>Football. You know, football said to be the sport of kings, better than diamond rings but maybe not this ring. Check this out, past Friday night; New England Patriots owner Robert Craft hosted a private ceremony for his players and team members at his home. Well, they all got their championship rings. Remember that 28 to 3 comeback against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl? So, 283 rings to recognize the 28 to 3 comeback. 283 diamonds are on this ring, it totals 5.1 carats. And all Tom Brady showing it off along with Martellus Bennett. So they have a 28 to 3, a little bit of a dig at the Falcons and also a couple of quotes on the rings, as well from Bob Craft, the team owner, unequivocally the sweetest and also greatest comeback all-time. How about those rings?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can't wear them all at the same time.</p><p>BLOCK: It should have had two big diamonds on them to represent the two times they couldn't beat the Giants in Super Bowl.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: There you go.</p><p>MAX: I like that. I like that. That's fair. It's a good shot.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dropping the mic on that one, Mike. Dropping the mic, Mike. A brain freeze attack on the baseball field video showing a young fan winning a slurpy-sipping contest and that's going viral. Let's watch that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Six, five, four -- and time, time, all right. We are going to stop. All right. Let's see. Let's open , Kinley's. Kinley, what do you think, Rock?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: Minor League Baseball (INAUDIBLE) you had to know this was going to happen.</p><p>BLOCK: We've all -</p><p>MAX: Dagen, no joke like eight years ago, I was sucking down one of those coffee (INAUDIBLE) Dunkin' Donuts, I fainted. I'm not kidding, got brain freeze and the next thing I knew I came to.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Are you kidding?</p><p>MAX: No. Serious thing. And then I let you know -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It happened in New Orleans with the hurricane but that thing - that was (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MAX: Yes, yes, yes. Different thing. This had no alcohol in it. But yes, the brain that - it's not fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I thought that video was - it shows people why you should go to Minor League Games.</p><p>MAX: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: like I, you know, brain freeze?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: No, but they do really fun stuff but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like fun promotions and it's really about the community and local community and --</p><p>MAX: And watching baseball and not costing, you know, $400 for the family for it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly. And not being a major headache against the ballpark. I mean - because that is part of it. So hey, are you jealous? Are you going to U.S. Open?</p><p>MAX: I'm not. I'm not going.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So are you jealous that we're going? We're going to be -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MAX: I'm a little bit jealous. We can talk about that off the air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: I am very - now I'm very excited. I'm super excited.</p><p>MAX: Will you guys be texting me like, \"Hey, what's an eagle? What's a double-eagle?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Ah, ah, ah, ah.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I went to Wake Forest, as the home of Arnold Palmer, Lanny Wadkins, Curtis Strange, Billy Andrade. So I know my, Michael.</p><p>MAX: What's your handicap?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, I am a horrible golfer. But I know, Michael.</p><p>MAX: Are you looking forward to? It should be gorgeous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love why -- there is nothing better than being on a course and watching really incredible golf because you get to see firsthand, how incredibly difficult it is.</p><p>MAX: Beautiful time of year also to be in Wisconsin. Erin Hills looks to be pretty gorgeous course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh my gosh. Yes. I love the people of Wisconsin, so open your arms, people, we'll be there Thursday and Friday. Thank you, Jared.</p><p>MAX: Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jared Max. Jared's sports report on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 SiriusXM 115.

Blake Burman at the White House with more. Good morning, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Dagen. Good morning to you as well. Last week at the White House was infrastructure week at a rollout. It got a bit muddled once Jim Comey headed to Capitol Hill. This week, they have got a new focus somewhat of a round two. They will be focusing on workforce development. The main push here according to top officials, at the White House, is on trying to build out apprenticeship to that end. The President will be headed on the road this week, tomorrow, he will be going to Wisconsin, speaking at a trade school in Waukesha, Wednesday to Labor Department, Thursday, here at the White House.</p><p>He has a roundtable with several state governors. This whole issue of workforce development has been a push of <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump. </nameText></person>She was on \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\" this morning to tout rollout administration will be having throughout the week and she admitted that there has been -- as she put it a level of visual viciousness in Washington, that caught her off guard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>IVANKA TRUMP, </nameText></person><person><nameText>PRESIDENT TRUMP'S </nameText></person>DAUGHTER: I didn't expect it to be easy. I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was -- I was a little blindsided by on a personal level.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: So, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this workforce development roll out, Dagen, Friday sources tell Fox that the President will end his workweek in Miami where he will unveil his administration's policies as it relates to Cuba. You can expect at least somewhat of a rollback of the Obama administration policies to that end.</p><p>By the way, later today here at the White House, the start off to the week the President will have a full cabinet meeting. All the members of his cabinet. Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Blake, thank you for covering all that for us. Blake Burman at the White House. Joining us now is former Texas Congressman and Republican Presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul. Congressman, the President is set to hold -- Blake mentioned, first full cabinet meeting today. Do you think this administration will now be able to move forward on the agenda that Americans want the reason they voted for him?</p><p>RON PAUL, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN: It is not likely but let's hope they move forward on right things because everything they say is not exactly going to solve all our problems. I don't happen to believe public works projects is a way to get more jobs. You might get more jobs but it won't be same as if you got more jobs in private sector. They make a lot of mistakes. I think obstacles are so great and people don't recognize the debt. When you have a lot of debt, it's hard to spend money. You come up with a trillion dollars for military and a trillion dollars for public works and repairing highways, where is the money going to come from? And this has an effect at marketplaces eventually. If you look at how much debt is out there whether it's automobile debt, college debt, personal debt and even housing debt right now, I mean, there is a lot of problems so that is why I think they are stymied because the fundamentals don't change. You can say these jobs -- the truth is dependent on government creating jobs or there's something wrong with the plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, I am going to push back in terms of the infrastructure plan and I will and you call it public works. I come on that I know that means you mean to evoke FDR's programs of the depression.</p><p>PAUL: I do, I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is what you say it but trillion dollars is not going to be -- actually a minority of it would be government money. Under the way, the plan is laid out now. They would -- Trump administration would get to trillion largely in parts from funding through private investors and the money is indeed out there. It was $59 billion raised last year in private infrastructure funds. Their goal is too easy the permitting process, easy regulations to get that money invested in projects alongside the government.</p><p>PAUL: Yes. The easing of regulations is very good and that is getting out of the way house in order, but this whole thing is partnership that bothers libertarians because partnerships, big businesses big banks in government isn't exactly what a free society is all about. That is not what a Republic is about because only favored people get to do the dealing. So I don't like partnership. I want an environment where people can be competitive and produce things that are necessary. But saying that we are going to have big government financing and big business financing, there is a lot of shortcomings with that plan.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST: Dr. Paul, Mike Block here. You raised a very valid concerns about debt levels and something people worry about except, I don't want to turn into a discussion on bond market, the bond yields are not reflecting a lot of concern about all this spending that you are talking about. The capital markets have this wrong? Is there something else going on here?</p><p>PAUL: Yes. I think they do. I am not an investor but just from an economic viewpoint, I do. You might have said tech stocks were good investment and things happen in a flash and bond markets can happen that way too, because all countries are in debt, and you know we have the European problem where you have Greece, and Italy, and Spain having problems but you are going to have something pop up. It's going to be very devastating but if you look at prices, when prices go high, when you have inflation, it is dangerous. So when you are saying bonds are pretty comfortable, you are saying that there is euphoria in the bond market; prices are very, very high; and I think it is where the bubble is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, I have been talking about that since 2009 and I will admit I have been dead wrong. Mitch, you got a question for the congressman? Saying that there is euphoria in the bond market prices are very, very high. And I think it is. I have been talking about that -- congressman I have been talking about that since 2009, and I will admit I have been dead wrong. Mitch, a question for the Congressman?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: You are not wrong, you are not wrong. But you can't predict his timing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe I will be right. I am sleeping in the dark. Congressman, I want Mitch to get a question for you.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: OK. When you look at the agenda with so few days really left in Session, where are the priorities? Is tax reform going to sort of fall about by way sided something we go back and reduce rates to stimulate the economy?</p><p>PAUL: When you say end of the session you mean for summer break?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, correct.</p><p>PAUL: That sort of thing?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: No. They are not going to get that done there's too many special interests. They should just be cutting, spending and cutting taxes and if you can't cut it all one time cut something. But no. They want the whole package which I understand. But it's not enough agreement. Everybody has their ax to grind. It's going to be hard to get them together besides a lot of Republicans are not dedicated to what I am talking about. They are dedicated to taking care of their friends. I mean, if -- you know, it takes medical care. They have a lot of friends in the insurance industry, and the drug industry.</p><p>They are not liable to change that and cut down real spending. They will do their talking but, Dagen, when you start cutting back it is a problem. I mean, it is hard to get an addict off drugs and that is what we're trying to do. First, I don't think they start with the basic principle. The government ought to be very limited and strive for that. They say government -- we just need better management. I don't buy into that. I think we have too much mismanagement.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, real quick. Heather.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT: Dr. Paul, the Federal Reserve is set to hike interest rates this Wednesday. A quarter basis point. You're talking about our debt levels. What will that effect have on interest rates to service this debt?</p><p>PAUL: Oh it is going to being up, supposed the market has already discounted that, but no, if they creep up, what would happen if we had a market rate of interest which is what we need to get economy. What if interest rates were three percent? This whole worldwide system would collapse because everything depends on more and more and more now they are tinkering a quarter point here, a quarter point there. They are really not doing a whole lot so I don't think this is a trend at all.</p><p>I think this is wishful thinking. I think that if you go up a little bit more even if a little bit is going to be a bigger burden on the treasury. This is where so much production has to go eventually with increase in interest rates, and eventually interest rates will go up, then that pay all the production. We cannot pay it. We cannot pay. We have to print more money!</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Keep printing. Good to see you. Congressman Ron Paul, take care of yourself.</p><p>Still ahead, do they protect too much? Stuart Varney weighs in on the outrage after New York City play used a <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>look-alike in the role of the assassinated Julius Caesar. Why analysts are going sour on Apple.</p><p>MCDOWELL: GE shares jumping after the company announced CEO <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt </nameText></person>is leaving. Nicole Petallides covering the story at New York Stock Exchange. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We have this upside this morning for General Electric looking up about three percent right now, 3.7 percent so good move for GE who's been under pressure and overall but needs to cut costs and outperform a little bit. It has been under pressure. Shareholders were not too happy with <person><nameText>Jeff Immelt </nameText></person>particularly Trion funds and so he will be stepping down and <person><nameText>John Flannery </nameText></person>who is a 30-year veteran there will move up to the top spot of CEO and that will happen on August 1st. And so GE gets a pop.</p><p>Watching also Microsoft which sold off of all tech stocks on Friday but it's come out now about the new X-Box 1x. OK, this is supposed to be their smallest ever X-Box 499. Everybody is waiting for this one. It's supposed to have the graphics and the memory and speed, bandwidth and sound as well to really outpace the whole industry. And that will be available in time for the holidays.</p><p>And last but not least, watching Apple which sold off in a big way on Friday. In fact, it's biggest selloff in 14 months weighed on Dow, shaved off 41 points on Friday, it is down again cutting it this morning but still saying it's going to be strong for the holiday season, still liking the iPhone but this is really evaluation call because we have seen tech stocks really run up. And it's not even 5 percent of the 52-week high. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nicole, thank you so much. Nicole Petallides in the New York Stock Exchange. Another controversy surrounding creative depictions of the President. Two sponsors, major corporations, pulling out of the Shakespeare In The Park here in New York City after a production of Julius Caesar shows a <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>look alike being stabbed to death on the Senate floor. Again, it's a play. It's Shakespeare. So, who do we go to? British man. Host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY,\" Stuart. Of course, you're going to talk about Shakespeare this morning, my friend.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST: You don't know what to call me, do you? You were just kind of lost there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to call you -- I was going to say, superstar.</p><p>VARNEY: No let's not get crazy. Look, I am picking up on what our viewers are seeing on the left-hand side of the screen, Shakespeare in the Park. It's really kind of pass\u201a for New York but not voters in the rest of the country. I think they are appalled to see our President, a man looking like our President being stabbed to death in Central Park for Shakespeare in the Park. The audience apparently just loved it. That is New York, I guess. I think it is dangerous. This comes on top of the severed head from Kathy Griffin.</p><p>I just think that we are leading the country in entirely the wrong direction, leading it towards a violent confrontation between left and right. I don't think that is good for anybody. But then, let's not forget Democrat senator from New York over the weekend, dropping the \"f\" bomb in public right there. I have to believe that, that was focus group tried and tested. This is how you appeal to millennials, use obscene language. I think it is a dangerous situation, and I think it is something that voters are going to reject. That is where I am coming from.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I felt like when she said that, Stuart, it was the equivalent of a 3-year-old making flatulent sounds. They do it for attention.</p><p>VARNEY: Juveniles. The snickering going on in the audience and by her. It is beneath the office of senator and it should not be taking place in our country at this time.</p><p>The level of public discourse is gone down at tubes and the level of violence displayed against and the contempt displaced for our President knows no bounds I think it's counterproductive for us all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A British gentleman. That's what I --</p><p>VARNEY: An American.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You are. You are you are the -- the represent greatest that is America in terms of the opportunities that this nation provides and how you seized upon it cherish it, I mean that Stuart, you talk about it all the time.</p><p>VARNEY: Well thank you very much indeed, Dagen, I appreciate that I do thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you, we'll see you in exactly 10 minutes, Stuart, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time. Coming up Uber, planning to put its troubles in the rear view mirror, a key executive reportedly resigning amid questions about the company's workplace culture the fallout for the ride-sharing giant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The mastermind behind terror attacks on two landmarks in Iran last week apparently has been killed. Cheryl Casone has details on that.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, so Dagen according to the New York Times, the top official in Iran says that intelligence officers hunted down and killed the man behind attacks in Iran. ISIS said it is behind the assault in Iran's parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of Islamic Republic of course that killed 17 people that attack while the newspaper says Iranian investigators are looking into the attacks, increasingly focusing a on group of radicalized Iranian Kurds.</p><p>OK. Back in here in home Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may temporarily step aside this potential move coming on the heels of Uber's board of Directors, adopting a series of recommendations about the company's corporate culture from an internal investigation from former Attorney General Eric Holder.</p><p>And a new federal audit showing that Medicare erroneously paid an estimated $729 million to doctors and other health professionals. The payments came under a multibillion-dollar federal initiative to designed shift the health care system from paper records to computers, the audit found that over three year period Medicare improperly paid health professionals since that they bonus payments under the initiative but in reality they either lacked required proof or they failed to meet the criteria for the bonuses.</p><p>And then one New Jersey couple had a surprise crasher at their wedding on Saturday. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>dropped by to congratulate Kristen Piatkowski and Tucker Gladhill at his Bedminster golf club. He danced with the bride, he shook hands with the guests Trump well-known for joining wedding parties at the resort said he runs, guess he used to run, you may recall back in February he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped in on a wedding reception in Mar-a-Lago. So, you know, get married at the Bedminster in Jersey and you'll never know who is going to show up, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So far that's pretty cool.</p><p>BLOCKS: And <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes exactly, and the President of the United States doesn't drink and so you don't need to worry about him, you know, hitting the open bar, right? So maybe the food tables, not the bar, coming up final thoughts from our all-star panel.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Final thoughts from our all-stars. Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be in public or private and big tech names to watch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Buckle up, that's what you're saying.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Buckle up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Michael Block.</p><p>BLOCK: I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How many years?</p><p>BLOCK: A lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bad son. But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the markets up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That we probably won't find out until the fall I think Septembers the application for that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Maybe. MCDOWELL: Thanks to Heather and Michael and Mitch, see you all. And Maria will be back tomorrow. She's going to interview Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at 7 a.m. Eastern time, and then we go to the U.S. open but right now it's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017061203cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NSC-HR71-DXH2-6386-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 12, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Low bar works very well.  Thank you ladies.  Good  morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June  12th.  Your top stories at 6:00am Eastern Time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Getting the agenda back on track as the White House moves past the  controversy surrounding James Comey's testimony last week, the  administration is now solely focused on getting America back to work.   President Trump is expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin  tomorrow, this comes as the battle over tax reform and healthcare ramp up  Capitol Hill.</p><p> The outrage in the park, a New York City play uses a President Trump look- a-like for the role of the assassinated Julius Caesar, the fallout as both  Delta and Bank of America pull their sponsorships.</p><p>Uber under fire, the board of director is expected to unveil a massive  shake up following an investigation into the company's sexual harassment  scandal.  Several reports say that CEO, Travis Kalanick could take a leave  of absence while another key executive maybe out of a job, the details  ahead. </p><p> Futures are showing the start of a week with a lower open but you have the  DOW that closed at a record high on Friday.  The NASDAQ, those same stocks,  your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, those were in the dunks on  Friday, we're going to dig in to that later this hour.  In Europe, stocks  are lower across the board, England, France, and Germany, they are the  biggest loser being the CAC krones and France but the DAX in terms of  selloff not far behind.  In Asia overnight, markets were all in the red as  well, a one and a quarter percent lost in the Hang Seng but you see red  across your screen in Asia to start this week.</p><p> A massive heat wave striking the U.S., record breaking temperature  stretching from Omaha to New York City, what you can expect for the rest of  the week coming up.  </p><p> And the Penguins putting the predators on ice, Pittsburgh topping Nashville  to win its second straight Stanley Cup, the highlights from the big game  ahead.</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning.  With me, Financial  Analyst, Heather Zumarraga is back with us.  Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist, Michael Block, my friend it's been too long.  And PWC Partner,  Mitch Roschelle.  Welcome each and every one on you.</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Good morning.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He -- Mike has set the bar high.  He was pre-gaming with Pantera  this morning.  Speaking of rage, I don't know where Pantera takes you but  we'll see.  We got three hours to find out.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  (inaudible) in the green room though.</p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  No, it's very  calm, it's very exciting.  You think old school metal you think this, of  course. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Actually I do.</p><p> BLOCK:  Full of surprises.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  As Washington is as well, full of surprises.  And  coming up this morning to discuss the agenda and everything that's  happening down in D.C. that matters to your money.</p><p>Florida Congressman, Ron DeSantis is here.  The Schork Report, Steven  Schork.  Fox News Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitanom one of our  favorites.  And Former Texas Congressman and Presidential Candidate, Ron  Paul.  You don't want to miss a second of it.  </p><p> But first, President Trump tending back to jobs, the White House is kicking  off what it calls workforce development week focusing on boosting  apprenticeship programs for blue collar workers.  This comes as the White  House continues to grapple with fallout from Former FBI Director, James  Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill last week.  The president once again  weighted into the news tweeting this yesterday, \"I believe that James Comey  leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone thought possible.  Totally  illegal?  Very cowardly!\"</p><p> The South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham warns the president's own words  on the Russia probe are getting in the way of his agenda and something  getting done, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  Here's what's so frustrating for  republicans like me, you may be the first president in history to go down  because you can't stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that  if you just were quiet would clear you.  This is frustrating for me to want  to help a man who I think will do big things, no other republican would do  like immigration.  Believe it or not, I think Donald Trump may deliver us  from a broken immigration system, this is not helping.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now is Former New York Congresswoman, now a Member of  the Board of Directors for the Independent Women's Forum, Nan Hayworth.   Congressman, good to see you.  How did it help though with Senator Lindsey  Graham using language like, \"going down\" in terms of the presidency?  These  -- none of these republicans are helping and I point back to just that  panel last week that interrogated James Comey, they gave him the past quite  frankly.</p><p> FMR REP NAN HAYWORTH (R) NEW YORK, BOARD OF DIRECTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S  FORUM:  Well -- and I think the watch for really is discipline on all sides  if we really want to get.  And there is a great agenda that the president  was elected legitimately to pursue including job creation as you were just  mentioning.</p><p> Then he needs to I think apply discipline to his social media habits, he's  capable of doing it, he's a very smart man who knows how to reach out to  the public and on republican side, we have to hang together.  So we're  going to have to all of us learn how to accept the signals among ourselves  and not use language that's vulnerable to use by those on the left who want  to bring the agenda down.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  He's clearly appealing to the base with the tweets but can that  be broader?  I mean it looks like the base gets fragmented at times with  some of the messages that come in out of the tweets?</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Well, yes, because they tend to be unfortunately a bit in  temperate, maybe impulsive.  The president is no question blunt and in some  ways that's to be preferred over certain other forms of communication.</p><p> But, yes, the president -- look, he's great at reaching out.  Look at the  groups he campaigned among when he was running for president, right?  He  went to urban communities, he went to obviously the blue wall, the blue  states, he appealed to labor.  These are folks he can continue to bring in  in a very important way because he's really got an incredible mission that  he's pursuing.  This job's initiative is going to be very powerful.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And let's talk about that Mike because yesterday, President  Trump had one Comey tweet I think all day long but he was tweeting about  the economy.  The performance of the stock market, then number of jobs  created particularly with this apprenticeship program, you have a record  number of job openings in this country, there are six million positions  waiting to be filled.</p><p> And according to stats from the Labor Department, nine out of ten Americans  who complete apprentice training land a job, their average starting salary  is $60,000 a year, it's an underused way to get people back into the  workforce.</p><p> BLOCK:  It's exciting to hear about this and I think we all want to hear  more about this.  The thing with this is, you have an apprenticeship  program, you're helping to increase the American worker's productivity.</p><p> This is what's going to drive growth, this is what will drive wages, this  is what will drive quality of life.  We want to keep hearing about this.   My question for you is, who within Trump circle can get him refocused on  what's going on here?  I want to hear more about this, enough with the  emails.  We keep going back to that.  Enough with Comey, enough with this,  let's focus on growth, let's focus on making America great again.  Who can  help me do that?</p><p> HAYWORTH:  I agree.  Well look, the president has a -- really a group of  gifted people around him.  I mean he's chosen some very smart people, not  all of whom have fallen into line with everything that he said and we know  that as well.</p><p> So I think we all look to Ivanka, we look to -- Mrs. Trump is going to be  taking a presence from the White House and I think she is quite savvy --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And she tweeted a photo from being in the White House.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Yes, exactly.  So I think having Melania there may also be a  moderating influence and --  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  She didn't take his phone from him?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  She probably has more access than anyone else but --  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  And don't you believe that the media in part, it may be their  fault in focusing the message on the tweets and on the emails and not on  jobs or these growth initiatives like healthcare and tax reform.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Heather, there's no question about it.  And he -- the president  creates the bait and take the bait and he really has so much to offer in  such an important agenda.  He has to be aware that the media are not going  to be with him --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  All the way.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Don't give them ammunition.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well we did to that point in the press conference.  On Friday,  he said 100 percent I'll sit down with -- I'll talk to Robert Mueller if  you ask me and talk under oath and then he also raised the issue of the  potential existence of tapes?</p><p> And so now what's everybody going to be talking about this, Jeff Sessions  testifying tomorrow, we don't know if it's going to be in public or not.   But, again, that's why you have to avoid talking about all of this and I  fault a lot of the republicans because there's division in the agenda.   There's division in the republican party about how to raise revenue in any  kind of tax reform, there's a lot of division about healthcare because  these non-conservative republicans don't want to give up the Medicaid  funding that they got under ObamaCare.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Dagen, I'm with it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Every reason to oppose the build in the senate that came out of  the house on ObamaCare repeal.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  I lived it in the House of Representatives when I was there.  We  had the great wave in 2010 and we thought, \"Boy, we're going to be able to  move forward swiftly\" and it was very, very difficult.</p><p> And a lot of it is that there are in every congressional district and in  every state, there are certain key concerns among constituencies that the  electives no matter their party have to try to honor.  I do think one thing  that the president's been calling for that I think is a very smart thing  for him to pursue and I would pursue it behind the scenes with Mitch  McConnell is to work hard on the filibuster on culture and legislation  because really truly Chuck Schumer is --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  He's coming after the administration not just President Trump.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Exactly.  It doesn't matter of how brilliant the plan the  republicans come up and how unified they may be and how ecumenical they'll  be about those concerns.  Chuck Schumer's got to block it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're getting awfully too with Chuck Schumer inviting the  president to testify in front of congress.  Come on man, you think about  your constituents. </p><p> Nan, there's a controversial -- speaking of New York City, a controversial  production of Shakespeare in the Park, the Shakespeare play, Julius Caesar  causing the New York-based public theater some of its sponsorship money.   Both Delta and Bank of America are pulling support after it shows basically  Caesar is portrayed as Donald Trump, it's a Donald Trump look-a-like being  stabbed to death on the senate floor.  And your reaction to this  controversy?</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Well the fascinating thing that, of course, that would be  directive place is, well, of course, that we're pointing out that it's a  very bad thing to assassinate your leader because, of course, Julius Caesar  in the play, the come to a very dreadful and for Rome.</p><p> But what everybody's going to focus on, of course, is the fact that they're  assassinating a figure of Donald Trump and it's incredibly hypocritical for  folks in the entertainment industry to come after (inaudible) </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  So violent.  It's just so, so violent.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  They would never have done that with his predecessor.  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  No.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, again, these companies Mitch, they're saying, \"Enough is  enough.\"</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Listen, know amongst your brand --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of like you saw what happened to Kathy Griffin and she  cried crocodile tears and then blamed the Trump family for taking her down,  hasn't been taking personal responsibility for what happened.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  I mean that's just cunning that anybody would take her seriously  after something like that.  And Delta and Bank of America are listening to  the American public which they should.</p><p> BLOCK:  I want to know what the producers of this play were thinking after  what happened to Kathy Griffin are going to do in this.  I don't care what  your political views are, you could dislike Trump.  This is incitement to  violence, why would you do this?  What are you thinking? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well because it's -- well because New York City and it would --  if they're playing to the -- either playing to their base.  They're playing  to their left wing liberal, (inaudible) who happened to love Shakespeare  and what to enjoy seeing something like that.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  That's limited to public.</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  I like Shakespeare too.  It's like Shakespeare is more clever  than you are.  Keep it to what it should being throw up.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What were you going to say Mitch?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  No, I was thinking it's really difficult for brands to get  associated with something that becomes so controversial.  Somebody say  there's no such thing as bad publicity but that could in fact be bad  publicity.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Oh Mitch, I think you're right.  And the amazing thing, it's  really sad and troubling that so many figures in the marketplace,  retailers, I mean we saw it with the Ivanka Trump lines at various --  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Nordstrom.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  Right.  Various stores.  I just think it's really sad that  things have become some politicized around the figure of the president in  this way.  I think Delta and Bank of America did the right thing.  I just  think it's a sad commentary on where we are in this political (inaudible) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  In those times that we're getting better.  Nan, thank you so  much.  Nan Hayworth, former congresswoman.  Take care.</p><p> HAYWORTH:  It was a pleasure.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Uber struggling to put its troubles in the rearview  mirror.  A key executive reportedly resigning amid questions about the  company's workplace culture, the fallout ahead for the ride sharing giant.  </p><p> And will the U.S. add another star to its flag?  Air flag.  Puerto Rico   voting for statehood in a contentious referendum.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick could be taking a leave of absence,  Cheryl Casone has the details on that developing story, Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So Dagen, Uber's board of  directors has adopted a series of recommendations about the company's  corporate culture from Former Attorney General Eric Holder.  So it's not  clear whether the board is going to approve a leave of absence for Kalanick  but we should know more possibly there tomorrow.</p><p> And then according to the Wall Street Journal, Uber's Chief Business  Officer, Emil Michael could resign as early as today.  This comes after 20  Uber employees were fired last week for claims of harassment,  discrimination, and bullying.</p><p> Well, Puerto Rico has voted of statehood in a nonbinding referendum.  More  than half a million people voting yesterday to turn the U.S. territory into  the 51st state.  Bu the participation rate was just 23 percent, that leaves  many to question the validity of the vote that was boycotted by several  opposition parties.  Congress has the final word on any changes to Puerto  Rico's political status here.  The referendum coming on the 100th  anniversary of the U.S. granting U.S. citizenship to Puerto Rico.</p><p> Well, summer has arrived in the form of a heat wave over much of the  country.  The heat stretched from Omaha to New York and forecasters say  it's going to, well, stick around for a few days.  Omaha fell 94 degrees  yesterday, Chicago's 88, New York expecting temperatures in the 90s again  today and tomorrow the cool off here in the New York area on Wednesday.</p><p> And then finally this, the Stanley Cup trophy is staying in Pittsburgh.   The Penguins won their second straight title beating the Predators at six  games.  Sidney Crosby the MVP for the second straight year.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIDNEY CROSBY, PENGUINS MVP:  We settled to try to go back-to-back, we knew  it was going to be difficult but you know I think that's probably where the  most joy comes out of it, it's just knowing how difficult it is now to go  back-to-back.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  All right.  The Penguins become the first team in 19 years Dagen,  to win back-to-back titles.  And I did see something about NASCAR over the  weekend but I'll leave it there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, they were racing out in Pocono.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, my sister was like all jazzed about it.  Anyway, those are  your headlines.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll get to that.  We want to go back to Uber really quickly.   Michael, what the heck going on at this company?  It -- like what happened  to Travis Kalanick, does that even matter at this point because he's been a  lightning rod over and over again including him berating one of the Uber  drivers on camera?</p><p> BLOCK:  It matters because we're finding this great phenomena where  supposedly liberal accepting Silicon Valley is people blame Wall Street on  one time.  </p><p> But it's become this massive sexual harassment and political incorrectness  and all sorts of things and it make it harder for Uber to A, have a good  public image, it's already tarnished and to attract the right talent.  Now,  the issue here is that you're going to have a lot like strong investors,  other Silicon Valley type of venture capital firms but also the entire  financial investing spectrum is involved in these companies now.  Whether  you think your household name, mutual funds, hedge funds, endowments,  sovereign wealth funds are all involved in this Uber and they're not going  to stand for this.  I don't think he's going to survive this.  I think  another strong leader will emerge out of this.  The company will be fine,  we'll see what it's worth though.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And part of the crisis at Uber, it's been a number of things and  a general feeling and understanding what the culture is like at Uber in  Silicon Valley.  There was also the issue, there was another Uber executive  who has since left who was accused of improperly obtaining a rape victim in  India, her medical records, her confidential medical records.  But, again,  it's just individuals who work there clearly over -- stepping over lines.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The other company that is a disruptor and they are being  disrupted, what's interesting is they're not the only game in town, they  have primary competitors and actually local cities, taxable commissions are  becoming competitive, so that's part of the problem is disruption.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And behavior within the company among the management.   Coming up, will we see another interest rate hike tomorrow?  What to expect  from this week's federal reserve meeting and the markets.</p><p> And Wonder Woman buries The Mummy at the box office, it's not all bad news  for the Tom Cruise blockbuster, Tom Cruise is in it?  Why Universal might  not send the horror franchise back to the crypt just yet.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stocks under pressure this morning, 33 point loss on the DOW  Futures but, again, it's text stocks, the worst performer in premarket.   Michael, the second day -- straight day of weakness in that sector and you  got those same stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, I mean you throw  in Microsoft and Apple, they all got taken to the woodshed, they were down  three to roughly four percent each and every one on them on Friday.</p><p> BLOCK:  This is after (inaudible).  Now what I'll --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  well explain it then, she'll worry about it.</p><p> BLOCK:  Sure.  I'll explain it here and I'll go by over the weekend Jack  Bogle from Vanguard who's very accomplished, the father of passive  investing said, \"I still like the U.S. stock market because everyone else  is saying get out of it, I'm going to go against the crowd.\"</p><p> Mr. Bogle, you are the crowd, everyone is crowded paying stocks.  No, with  all due respect, he is the crowd.  And everyone's crowed for the same  stocks, it's true of the major indices, it's true of these text stocks.   It's not a matter of valuation.  Barons this weekend gave you the bull case  for LAM research which is semiconductor equipment stock and I'll tell you  the valuation, how it's going a lot higher, that stock was down  substantially on Friday because everyone owns it, I get the bull pieces.   Everyone else gets the bull pieces too, that's the problem with stocks like  this. </p><p> And when everyone crowds into the same thing and there's any perturbation  in the system, things are going to go down.  These stocks are still viable,  people want to own growth but they need a little break here so we're seeing  day two of that, let's see how much longer it goes, eventually you want to  own these stocks again.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  And don't you think it took someone to make the first move  which happen to be Goldman in this case and the analyst said, \"Let's get  out of these names.  These names maybe oversold, overheated, the large cap  growth names, let's move into other sectors such as financials and energy\"  as we saw Friday that were undervalued.  Is that strong (inaudible) back  and more people, investors are going to follow a suit now and get off the  trade --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Assuming that the actual investors with money to put to work  listen to analyst saying more but --  </p><p> BLOCK:  Well it's a good point.  Goldman's making a call, frankly I was  making a call.  But I'm not Goldman, I'm Moreno but I'll take (inaudible)  folks who listen and say, \"Hey -- I'm like, hey look, these stocks are  crowded.  Do you want to put a rotation game, you need to get into these  stocks Friday when it's exactly right.\"</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Back to rotation.</p><p> BLOCK:  Broken clocks are right twice a day.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Twice a day.</p><p> BLOCK:  So there you go.  So if Goldman said about me say about anyone  else.  But the point is, there should be some rotation here, I could be  bullish in U.S. stocks, one of the most bullish things is this rotation.  </p><p> As money comes out of tech, it goes back in the financials and the energy,  we had this rotation, nothing gets too over bought, tech did now the air's  coming out, we just keeping rolling along, keep your feet moving.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about -- real quick, what about the Fed?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  It's -- then the question is, if the Fed's going to  continue to raise rates throughout the air, good for financials, if they  don't, maybe not good for financials.</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  And if you want to address that, one thing I'll say is,  again, it all comes down to set -- positioning.  Financials were left for  dead, you had the big banks saying a key to trading was going to be soft,  we see the yield curve get flatter and flatter, they can't make the  margins, everyone's getting on financials.</p><p> I said, \"Well, here's your opportunity because sooner or later we're going  to see some little tick up in the yield curve when we get this slightest  kind of growth, I don't think growth is dead, I think it's -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well and the hint of growth also hopefully would improve their  loan making.</p><p> BLOCK:  That include loan book, trading activity would go up, a lot of  different underwriting activity, a lot of different things.  So for me,  it's a matter of saying what was -- the whole thing baseball play, we will  (inaudible) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you like stocks does not --  </p><p> BLOCK:  (inaudible) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you say you like stocks but not tech, that's the question.</p><p> BLOCK:  No, I'm going to like tech eventually but right now I think we're - -  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But right now.</p><p> BLOCK:  We're day two into selloff, I say we let go eventually to bigger  opportunity but we'd pound the table and say. \"Now, it's time to get back  in and reposition.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Okay.  Coming up, new collection swirling this morning over  whether President Trump recorded his conversations with Former FBI  Director, James Comey.  The debate over the tapes, next.</p><p> And a boozy brain freeze, why adults are asking for refill to this ice  cream.  I've tried it --  </p><p> BLOCK:  Where?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here Mike, and it's delicious.  We'll give you the scoop.</p><p> BLOCK:  6:00 in the morning?  Woo-hoo.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  That's too early for ice cream.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 12th.  Your top stories  at 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p> The chaos over Comey continues.  President Trump will reveal that  conversations between him and the former FBI chief were recorded.   Republicans have urged the commander-in-chief to make the reveal as soon as  possible.  The latest, as former FBI Director Comey, may be called to  testify on Capitol Hill, yet again.</p><p> Could be a rough week for Apple.  The company's stock downgraded for the  second time in a week over concerns surrounding the hype around its  upcoming iPhone 8.  Why the enthusiasm might be a bit too much.</p><p> Futures are showing weakness in this morning.  We have losses across the  board, which point out the Dow and the Russell 2000 that gave small cap  stocks closed on Friday at record highs.  The real weakness was in the  NASDAQ, which suffered a pretty stunning selloff.</p><p> After hitting a record high early in trading and then you have losses  across the board in Europe, the biggest loser there, CAC Quarante in  France.  In Asia overnight, the story was red across the board.  Japan,  Hong Kong, Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea all lower.</p><p> Gamers rejoice.  There's a new system in town.  Microsoft unveiling the  Xbox X, an incredible new feature that could be coming to your living room.   And Wonder Woman unwrapping another win. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIR PATRICK MORGAN:  Who is this young woman?</p><p> STEVE TREVOR:  She's my -- and --</p><p> DIANA:  Diana, Princess of --</p><p> TREVOR:  Prince, Diana Prince.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The superhero beats Tom Cruise's \"The Mummy\" to take the top  spot at the movies for the second week in a row.  The details as Wonder  Woman's box-office haul tops over $400 million.  Plus, beating the heat  with a stiff drink and ice cream.  We've got the booze-infused treat that's  helping you cool down this summer.</p><p> Our top story this half hour.  New questions surrounding President Trump's  claim that he recorded his conversations with former FBI Director James  Comey.  The President's legal team says, \"He is planning to reveal whether  or not the tapes actually exist this week.\"  Meantime, Republicans are  urging the President to clear the air on the matter as soon as possible.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE:  This is an issue that the President should  have cleared up in his press conference.  He should give a straight yes or  no to the answer -- to the question of whether or not the tapes exist.  I  don't think a subpoena should be necessary, and I don't understand why the  President just doesn't clear this matter up once and for all.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us this morning is former Deputy Assistant Director for  the FBI's Counterterrorism, Counterterror Division, Terry Turchie.  Terry,  your thoughts on this matter and the allegation that there are tapes out  there.</p><p> TERRY TURCHIE, FORMER FBI'S COUNTERTERRORISM DIVISION DEPUTY ASSISTANT:   Well, I guess, Dagen, that if there are tapes out there, it'd be best to  have them and see what's on them.  But, I think, we already know what's on  them, if they exist.  And we know what Director Comey said.  And so, we  pretty much have already all made up our own minds as to whether anything  on there constitutes some sort of crime.</p><p> I'm actually much more concerned, and quite frankly, don't understand why  we're not talking a lot more about that New York Times article in February  of -- February 14th of this year.  That article, according to Mr. Comey, in  his own words, in the main, wasn't true.  And I thought, all of this was --  started because of Russian collusion and the whole idea that perhaps  President Trump was colluding with the Russians.  And I think, we need to  know a lot more about that article.</p><p> We need to know about those three or four sources inside government  somewhere and their motives, and if we want to answer the question about  Russian collusion, that's where we go to get that answer, not those tapes.   And I don't understand why we're not working and worrying about that right  now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Terry, it's Mitch Roschelle.</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Terry.  If there is --  let's say there are no tapes, does this issue ever go away?  I mean,  there's always going to be another theory after another theory.  Does the  issue go away?</p><p> TURCHIE: Well, that's really a great question and here's why.  I don't  think the issues are ever going to go away.  They're going to come up with  one issue after another, if what I feel is correct, and I actually feel  President Trump is the one who is the victim of a Russian active measures  campaign.  Now, it could very well be that this is just some, sort of,  political thing involving the Democratic Party, maybe.</p><p> But, I think, if there's Russian collusion and there's Russian intelligence  behind this, all of this looks much more when you look at the evidence,  like, if it points in that direction.  And if he looks like the victim of a  campaign intended to destabilize our country and basically stop his  presidency, which goes to the answer to your question, these issues aren't  going to go away if that's the case.  They're going to keep coming up with  one and then another.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What would be the reason to hold these tapes back, if there are  tapes?</p><p> TURCHIE:  Well, there wouldn't be any reason.  If there are tapes, let them  go.  I mean, I think, we all wonder if there are any or it was just  something he said in the moment.  But if there are tapes, let them go.  It  benefits him to let them go and we can all make up our own mind.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well, we wouldn't be -- Terry, before we move on, we  wouldn't be talking about this tapes -- these tapes if President Trump  hadn't brought them up again on Friday.</p><p> TURCHIE:  Well, he brings things up all the time.  Everybody's --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it hurts him.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But it hurts him.  It doesn't help.</p><p> TURCHIE:  It sure does.  It doesn't.  And I think, that this is, kind of,  what we should expect though if we're going to put a non-politician type of  person, who pretty much, just wings it when he goes out and talks.  And I'm  certainly willing to see that happen.  I mean, that's what we get when we  choose somebody that's not a -- that hasn't been around Washington, D.C.</p><p> This is really the problem we have in the first place with the fact that  Director Comey, if nobody else was going to do it, should've talked to  President Trump about the way you deal with the FBI, because no president  deals with the FBI the way he kind of did, and I don't think he'd ever had  any discussions with anyone about that.  You've got to be very careful if  you're going to sit there and talk to the FBI director about anything.</p><p> And this is not new.  Remember that it is an open secret in Washington,  D.C., that for eight years, former FBI Director Louis Freeh and President  Bill Clinton had an open warfare going.  They did not talk, they didn't get  along, and it was all because President Clinton felt slid at something that  the director did.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> TURCHIE:  So, this is -- this is common.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Terry, good to see you.  Thank you so much for being here.   Terry Turchie.</p><p> TURCHIE:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we've got breaking news to bring you.  You've been watching  it.  These banners at the bottom of your screen, that Jeff Immelt is out at  General Electric.  The company just announcing that Immelt will be replaced  by John Flannery as Chairman and CEO.  Flannery is current -- the current  President and CEO of G.E. Healthcare.</p><p> Mike Block, to you first, what do you make of this?  Again, it speaks to  what G.E. is today as a corporation.  And by the way, Immelt will stay on  as the chairman through December of this year.</p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  Right.  And you  know, this has been talked about for a while.  We've had some activists  involved in the stock.  Largely, this company has been left for dead by  investors.  They're in a situation where they'd cut off some of their  businesses that were profitable and generated cash flow over the years,  including the financial part of the business.  They've been pairing things  off.</p><p> Meanwhile, healthcare, which is Flannery's domain, has been chugging along.   The margins were topping out there.  Margins and lighting, which, you know,  I think, people think of G.E., they think of lighting.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BLOCK:  That's cut off.  That business is probably for sale.  Meanwhile,  they expanded heavily into oil and gas.  They're merging operations with  Baker Hughes, right around the time where margins are getting squeezed  there.  There's a lot of doubt about their dividend, there's a lot of doubt  about their free cash flow going negative.  People are really down on the  stock.</p><p> The question is, will investors view this as a positive step bringing in  Flannery who is someone, I think, is a fresh look, someone who's done a  good job of running health care, in most investor's opinion, will be good.   I think, it's a positive step.  This company still has a lot to get  through.  I think, someone on another network the other day said, you know,  \"G.E. is the market.  Look to G.E.,\" which I thought was, kind of, a --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Who says that anymore?</p><p> BLOCK:  Someone who shouldn't have said that because it was, kind of, a  silly thing.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's an old -- that's an old rusty saw somebody broke  that.  That's a chainsaw with the chain that's all busted.</p><p> BLOCK:  It was, kind of, like -- it was, kind of, like, a person who shall  remain nameless.  You know, in 1999 called they want their stock market  theory back.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p> BLOCK:  So anyway, that's why they're all here.  So, in any event, you  know, when it comes down to -- because this company doesn't have the  relevance it once did, but it's obviously, a bellwether stock still.  We're  going to see if this can turn around.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In the last year, the stock is lower.  This year, the stock  down, and you can look at the pre-market reaction to the fact that Jeff  Immelt is out.  I think, it was up about two and a half percent in pre- market.  That does say something about the need for leadership change.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Interesting story of transformation, though, in that company  because what you -- what most people think about it -- we were joking  before, what most people think about them doing, they're in a completely  different business and they fancy themselves a bit of a technology  innovator.  So, maybe the change is all part of the transformation.</p><p> BLOCK:  The end game maybe, but we are looking at G.E. Healthcare as one  entity, G.E. Oil and Gas is another.  And then, you know, after that,  what's really left, the industrial businesses, you know, heavy ones there,  but lighting is not left.  Maybe it becomes three or even four companies at  the end of this.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So perhaps, you've diversified yourself --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wait, are you saying that they would just break the company up?</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  It would be easier for investors to understand and allow  focus business models that's, sort of, coming down to -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Consolidate.</p><p> BLOCK:  They have a huge wall of debt and cash flows used to get underneath  then.  So Flannery, you know, you're up.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And two weeks ago, Jeff Immelt came out.  He stated  the $2 earnings per share got into 2018 would be the high end of  expectations actually.  And did he -- you know, was that -- should he not  have said that, in terms of guidance is coming down, we're really going to  have to stretch ourselves to meet this $2 earnings targets.</p><p> BLOCK:  Well, he -- you know, in his defense, if you will, he had to  because he was being pressured to talk about it.  And, you know, the fact  of the matter is, you know, with debt servicing they have to do and the  margins shrinking in oil and gas for now, and I think, that could come  back, that's the issue with this company.  So, very challenging, and people  are saying, \"You know what, we're not, you know -- it's time for Jeff to  leave and I think, that finally, the board and everything else got to him,  and you know -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great analysis, Michael.  We'll have more on this as the morning  wears on.  Coming up, the first family reunited under one roof.  Melania  Trump and Barron say goodbye to the Big Apple and move into the White  House.  Plus, Wonder Woman lasso's another win, while The Mummy unravels a  bit.  We break down the weekend box office.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  Futures pointing to a lower open.  29- point loss on the Dow Futures.  Watching the NASDAQ, of course, major  selloff to report in the NASDAQ.  On Friday, people are looking at that,  worrying about that potentially.</p><p> And we'll point out that Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric is  stepping down and he is being replaced under Immelt's tenure at G.E. from  September of 2001, that stocks (INAUDIBLE) down 28 percent.  If you  invested in the Dow or the S&amp;P 500, you'd be up triple digits.  </p><p> And we're looking at a few more stocks on the move this morning.  Microsoft  unveiling its latest video game console, the Xbox One X.  The company says,  \"It's the smallest and most powerful Xbox ever made.\"  It's expected to  launch November 7th for 500 bucks.  Microsoft shares are down this morning  as a big selloff in those shares yesterday along with Apple.  And Apple has  been downgraded to neutral from buy for the second time in a week.</p><p> Analysts at Mizuho expect that sales of the iPhone 8 will fall short of  attracting new customers.  Instead, sales will be driven largely by current  users upgrading to new phones.  And Apple's shares, again, lower in pre- market trading.  An insider attack killing U.S. Army Rangers in  Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone has the details on this.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  An Afghan soldier, Dagen,  opened fire on a group of U.S. Army Rangers, killing three of them and  wounding one.  This happened in Eastern Afghanistan.  The gunman was killed  in return fire.  The Taliban claiming responsibility for the attack.  More  than 8,000 U.S. troops are currently stationed in Afghanistan, we should  add.  The Trump Administration considering sending up to 5,000 additional  troops to that country.</p><p> Well, Montana Congressman-Elect Greg Gianforte has agreed to plead guilty  to misdemeanor assault today.  He is accused of body-slamming a reporter.   Gianforte has apologized to the journalist, Ben Jacobs, he also has pledged  to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization  that promotes press freedom.  The incident happened in Gianforte's campaign  headquarters last month.</p><p> Well, the White House is now a full house, now that First Lady Melania and  son Barron have joined President Trump in the executive mansion at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue.  Their official move to Washington coming nearly five  months after the president was inaugurated.  Melania and Barron have been  living at Trump Tower here in New York until Barron finished the school  year.  Barron is to attend a private school in Maryland this fall.  And  then, Wonder Woman, she beat the competition, new competition at the  weekend box office.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TREVOR:  Diana!</p><p> HIPPOLYTA:  Be careful of mankind, Diana.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE: The film helmed by a female director, female star, brought in $57  million in its second weekend, totally bearing the competition, which by  the way, with Tom Cruise's \"The Mummy,\" starring Tom Cruise, wrapped up a  much lower than expected 32 million in the debut weekend.  It came in  second place.</p><p> Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, based on the children's book,  came in 3rd, 12 million there, Pirates of the Caribbean finishing 4th, 10  million, and then Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the summer's we  should say highest-grossing film, thus far, did slip to 5th place with $6  million.  Dagen, once again, the ladies killing it at the box office over  the weekend.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Over the weekend, speaking of strong women,  I finished binge-watching the new season of House of Cards.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Don't say anything.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just going to say strong women, Robin Wright and then  Patricia Clarkson is in it, who's amazing.  And I started watching the old  FX show, Damages with Glenn Close and Rose Byrne, so I highly recommend  that as well, also on Netflix.  Because I'm a loser, that's what I do,  watch TV.</p><p> Coming up.  Turning is -- up a new twist on a dessert classic.  More adults  giving boozy ice cream a shot.  We have the scoop, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And this news breaking in the last 20 minutes or so, Jeff Immelt  is out at General Electric.  The company just announcing that Immelt will  be replaced by John Flannery, as Chairman and CEO, Flannery is currently  the President and CEO of G.E. Health Care, but this is - if you ask why,  and by the way, as Mike Block pointed out just a short while ago that this  move by a mini company watchers and investors is not surprising and was  expected by some, but did you ask why broadly speaking because since Jeff  Immelt took over as the CEO of General Electric, this was in September of  2001, that stock is down 28 percent.  What has the Dow and S&amp;P done?   They're up triple digits.  </p><p> Those broad market gauges, you just invested in an index fund, you would  have more than doubled your money.  If you put your money on Jeff Immelt  running G.E., you would have lost money.  That's point-blank, Mike, what  we're talking about.  Now, General Electric during Immelt's 10-year had  shed some low-margin businesses like the -- they got out of the lending  business out of the financial business, got out of the appliance business  but it's not enough to satisfy investors.</p><p> BLOCK:  You know, really, Heather made a point earlier where they've been  promising these earnings per shared targets, and they just couldn't make  them anymore.  They're crippled under a lot of debt, they have all these  legacy businesses, they have some contractual revenues in a lot of their  businesses that are just stifling their margin growth, you know, they  locked in - they aggressively locked into some deals across their business  lines.  I'm saying industrials, oil, and gas, that are coming back and  biting them.  So .</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Baker Hughes deal?</p><p> BLOCK:  Yes.  Right.  Possibly at the wrong time.  I think long-term,  that's going to be a great deal when you have this - when you're merging -  you know, when X number of companies goes to X-1, I think, it's a good  thing, you know, these are large oil service companies so they can end up  doing well, but it's going to take time, you need to own us right here; you  do the math on the evaluation of this company right now and really, I can't  find anyone that likes it.  Ironically, the fact that no one likes it,  maybe the best thing coming for it right now.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mike, you were saying before during the break that  there's activist shareholders in - how much of this do you think is in  response to pressure from activists?</p><p> BLOCK:  It's been sort of a time and pressure thing that it's really                                                                                                                                               (INAUDIBLE) you know, really well-acclaimed, brilliant activist investors  had been in there for a while, and they've been trying to work with the  company, and these guys tried to work with the company as whether it's  Nelson Peltz, Ed Gardner, the other folks there, and they've done -- you  know, they've done a great job with a lot of companies.  This is really a - - what G.E. in stables of a company here.  So, again, I predict this is  going to be four -- you know, three or four companies in the future, health  care, the industrial businesses, oil and gas and we're going to see where  it goes from there but this is going to be a - this is the long game, it's  not a trade.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have Robert Wolf on the phone, he is a Fox News Contributor,  he's a frequent guest on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  He's the CEO of 32 Advisors,  also ran UBS back in the day.  Robert, what do you make of this?</p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND 32 ADVISOR CEO (through telephone):   Well, listen, as you know, I've worked with Jeff for over a decade and  spent four or five years with him on President Obama's advisory council.   So, I mean, listen, just a thought leader, he had to go through an  incredible though decade of transforming G.E. away from G.E capital and  back as your prior guests - I'm sorry, I didn't know his name, I just tuned  in.  But as this prior guest mentioned into really the three core  businesses, industrial, health care and power.  I think that during that  transformation, he took the company from, you know, where they were losing  billions of dollars to now an incredibly well-capitalized company and I  think - you know, like all CEOs that sometimes it's time to pass the torch  after you take the company to these transformations, and based on what I  read about Flannery, it seems like he's absolutely the right guy.  </p><p> And so I think it seems like it's going to be a very smooth transition.   With respect to Nelson Peltz and (INAUDIBLE) and Ed Gardner, and them,  listen, they work hard to make sure that for their - for their investors  that they're forcing decisions at these type of large companies, whether  they end up going to a split, who knows, obviously it didn't work with  Pepsi, and Pepsi is flourishing without splitting but, you know, they did  force the hand at (INAUDIBLE) so, you know, I think time will tell whether  this company will stay as one now that G.E. Capital has been (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Robert, that was some incredible analysis that you gave us in  about a minute, and we thank you for that.  We just wish you were here in  person, Robert Wolf.</p><p> WOLF:  Me, too, thank you, Dagen.  Appreciate it.  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  We will see you soon.  We'll be right back,  everybody.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 12th.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Monday June 12th.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> In the last half hour this news breaking, Jeff Immelt out at General  Electric.  The company just announcing that Immelt will be replaced by John  Flannery as chairman and CEO.  Flannery is the current and president of GE  Health Care.</p><p> You can take a look at the market reaction.  Jeff Immelt hitting the bricks  and the stock rocketing higher, up more than 3.5 percent.</p><p> And getting America back to work, President Trump expected to unveil a new  jobs push in Wisconsin tomorrow.  The announcement comes amid a new agenda  push for the White House as the administration looks to shake off the  Russia election controversy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, RNC CHAIRMAN:  I'm calling for an end to the  investigations about President Trump's campaign colluding on -- with the  Russians.  This needs to end.  Nobody has come forward with any evidence  that there's been collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians and  it keeps persisting.  So it's time to put an end to this.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest on the renewed agenda push ahead.</p><p> Futures are showing losses across the board -- 31-point loss on the Dow  futures.  Another selloff at least it looks like that's going to happen on  technology stocks with the Nasdaq 100 futures down two-thirds of 1 percent.   Those winners this year, those incredible winners like Facebook and Amazon  and Netflix and the Google parent company -- they tumbled on Friday.</p><p> In Europe stocks also lower across the board in England, France and Germany  there.  About a 1 percent loss in France.</p><p> In Asia overnight, same story, nothing but red across the board with the  biggest loser being the Hang Seng down at one-and-a-quarter percent.</p><p> And check your cupboard, Chef Boyardee issuing a massive recall over  mislabeling -- what you need to know before you crack open that can.</p><p> California gold rush -- one lucky winner set to take home the tenth largest  lottery price in U.S. history -- the massive $447 million win ahead.</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning.  Financial analyst  Heather Zumarraga, Rhino Trading Partners chief strategist Michael Block,  and PWC partner Mitch Roschelle.  </p><p> Mitch -- Jeff Immelt out.  Do you agree with what Robert Wolf was saying  that -- Robert was complimentary of Immelt's tenure even though the stock  was down 28 percent since Immelt took over?  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  I think if you compare it to the Dow and  other index, to your point earlier, it doesn't look great but if you think  about all of the businesses that were in during that period of time and  what happened to those businesses -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The financial business.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes, the financial prices taking place, you had the industrial  complex sort of changing so he had to navigate a lot of major disruption in  traditional businesses.  </p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  He did.  And in his defense he may  have inherited as you're saying a lot of this that there's too many  businesses across the board.  Maybe we need to consolidate and selloff more  of these divisions to narrow our focus.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  GE if you look backwards it almost looked like a private equity  company with all of these different portfolio companies and the private  equity model it's private, you can do a lot of different things when you're  a public company.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's the old thought is that GE is a gauge of the U.S.  economy.  And to my point, well, the S&amp;P 50 a gauge of the U.S. economy is  up, what, 120 percent in the time that Jeff Immelt was running GE.  And GE  stock is down.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  At a different part of business  cycle perhaps it was the bellwether for the U.S.  Not anymore.  Again, you  know, to Jeff Immelt's credit, he did guide them through the crisis.   People thought that stock was going to zero.  It didn't quite go to zero.   Here it is.  It didn't outperform. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And also it got a lot of capital infusions during the financial  crisis.  </p><p> BLOCK:  It did.  As with other financials.  So that's, you know, that's  that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But during the bull market GE shares actually until the market  bottom fell out, the marker did beat the S&amp;P and the Dow.  So when times  were good they were better for GE but man, it got tough for the company.</p><p> And coming up this morning: the Schork Report's Stephen Schork on all  things oil and gas, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano, and GolfTEC CEO Joe Assell, and former Texas congressman and  presidential candidate Ron Paul.  You don't want to miss any of those fine  gentlemen.</p><p> And to our top story this hour -- another top story, President Trump  holding his first meeting with a full cabinet today.  This as the GOP  pushes both health care and tax reform.  House Whip Steve Scalise, majority  whip saying both are a priority.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. STEVE SCALISE (R), LOUISIANA:  Cutting taxes is going to inject so  much momentum into this economy, create a lot of jobs.  We also have the  health care bill moving through the Senate and I know they're trying to get  the text finalized so they can ultimately get to a vote by July 4th.  And I  think both are important to do and to do them as soon as we can.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Florida Congressman and House Freedom Caucus  member Ron DeSantis.  Congressman -- are you going to work through the  recess to get this done?  </p><p> REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  I think we have to.  You hear in  Washington, oh, there's all these things on the agenda, the appropriations  in addition to which you mentioned and we just have so few legislative  days.  Well, there's nothing written in stone that you have to take five  weeks in August and early September.  So my view would be we have to make  the most of our opportunities now and to kind of cut out and come back  without getting our work done I think would be a mistake.</p><p> Now, normally I would say it's better for the country when Congress isn't  in session because then they can't do damage.  But in this case we have a  number of things lined up and I think that the American people are not  going to say, they just ran out of time, they tried.  So yes, we have to  get it done I think whatever it takes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, it's Mitch Roschelle.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Congressman -- with a finite number of days left and they have  to start prioritizing what could get done this year and what can't, in the  sort of rock, paper, scissors game here -- is taxes going to be more  important than health care.  And then you also passed the bill last week  into the repealing and replacing Dodd-Frank.  Which of those becomes the  priority?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, I think that -- I don't know that I think of it that way  just because procedurally the healthcare is part of the FY 17 budget  reconciliation.  You've got to do that in order to go on to the next budget  which will then have the instructions to write the tax reform.</p><p> So I think you've got to do both of those.  I think you can do both of  those.  You know, the Dodd-Frank piece I think would be very good for the  economy, moving away from too big to fail and really lifting the burden off  a lot of our small and medium-sized financial institutions who have just  gotten clubbed by Dodd-Frank.</p><p> I think the issue is what in that bill would be able to get 60 votes in the  Senate.  And so it's not clear to me that there's a path for all of it,  maybe some of it.  But clearly I think that that would be a very good thing  if we're able to get that done  as well.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Heather Zumarraga -- Congressman, has a question for you.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  If we are lifting some of the financial regulations off of the  financial institutions or the big banks and Dodd-Frank, what -- do you  think that would be a positive for financials in freeing up more capital  for them in the long run?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Oh, yes, I think even in the short run if you look at the number  of new banks that have come into existence since Dodd-Frank I mean it's  infinitesimal.</p><p> And the biggest banks, by the way, have gotten bigger since Dodd-Frank.   They don't necessarily like a lot of the regulatory burdens but they have  the ability to deal with it.  It's really the smaller, medium-sized  institutions that get hurt.  I think hurts competition in that industry.   And yes, I do think that you'd have the ability.  </p><p> You know, when lending particularly for the small businesses that are kind  of the life blood of all of our communities, I think that has really been  one of the worst things about Dodd-Frank.  Some of the big deals still get  done but man, we want a financial system where those -- that money is  available for people.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- much is made about President Trump's problems --  some issues self-created, all of the drama coming out of the White House;  Senate leader Mitch McConnell wanting the President to provide less drama,  if you will.  But I point to the drama within your own party, where you  have senators and people in the House who can't agree on how are you going  to pay for tax reform?  Are you going to do tax reform?  Are you going to  do tax cuts?</p><p> In the Senate you see the division as they try to move ahead on the health  care bill that you passed miraculously but they don't -- some senators in  the Republican Party, they don't want to give up the Medicaid handouts.   They are making issues about the opioid crisis and coverage for rehab, if  you will.</p><p> Is part -- is a bigger problem in essence the division within the party and  not what happens out of the White House?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, I think that having debate within the party, I think  that's a healthy thing.  That's how you arrive at I think good outcomes.  I  mean the taxes is a good example.  A lot of us are very concerned about  having a border adjustment tax in there.  We think it's bad economics.  We  think that it will potentially stymie doing tax reform at all.  There's  other members that have a different view of that.  And I think that that's  healthy to have those debates.</p><p> I think the problem that I think Republicans in Congress have had is when  there's this big gap between their campaign rhetoric and then their actions  in Washington and we were very strong for years and years running against  Obamacare.  Wow we are in a position where the House obviously passed a  bill that Senate is doing some negotiations to just not get that done and  walk away.  I mean that would be a huge mistake.</p><p> So I think it's just understanding the promises you've made, not letting  the swamp and the environment in the swamp distort that and just keep the  rudder set on true north and we'll be ok.  To the extent we don't do that,  I think that's when you can run into some problems.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- you all might as well be running around on fan  boats, though.  I mean it looks like -- I mean from the outside looking in,  it looks like the same morass it was last October.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, I think, though -- I mean part of it is the narrative that  gets spun in Washington.  And I think one of the fall-outs from the Comey  stuff is a lot of this narrative that the media has been spinning about the  President has been a false narrative.</p><p> Comey was telling him privately behind the scenes you're not under  investigation, you're not under investigation.  Yet publicly Comey was  being coy about it.  He was effectively inviting a lot of irresponsible  speculation.  I think that was very damaging to the President, to our  agenda because it sucked a lot of the oxygen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I agree.</p><p> DESANTIS:  And I just think it's highly irresponsible of Comey.</p><p> But the thing is I think we are kind of beyond that now for that hearing.   I mean we know that the President is not under investigation.  We know that  there's not any evidence from the Russia stuff.  And so I think if these  committees can kind of bring this to a conclusion then I think they're be  more interest in some of the policy agenda.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly, I said that last week during the hearings  and after the hearings.  I felt like the Republican senators sitting on  that panel fed into the Comey narrative that they didn't push him hard  enough and questioned him hard enough.</p><p> I know time was of the essence, the hearing quite frankly, they needed a  lot more time to bear down on James Comey but you did not hear that -- you  wouldn't expect to hear it from the Democrats but you didn't hear it from  the Republicans.  Just pressing him on why didn't you resign, why didn't  you say something to President Trump, why didn't you report this to anybody  at the Justice Department if he felt compromised by Trump's comments about  Michael Flynn.  All of that, I blame the Republicans in part.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, it's true.  I mean you noticed he said he felt queasy when  Attorney General Lynch told him to refer to it as a matter yet, he  basically went ahead and did it and didn't do anything to raise a red flag.   He exonerated Hillary himself because he felt Lynch was conflicted but  never offer to resign.</p><p> So I think kind of one of the things that's coming through his testimony is  he tends to do what's best for him and his image.</p><p> And I think his testimony has left a lot of questions and if he comes back  to Congress and maybe the Senate or House Judiciary Committees, you know, I  think that there's going to be a lot of things he's going to have to answer  for.  And so the extent he was going to be this star witness, I'm just not  sure that that was case at all.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, long-time Democrat,  raising the issue of a senate panel looking into Loretta Lynch and what she  told James Comey about the Hillary Clinton investigation.</p><p> Congressman DeSantis -- it was good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> DESANTIS:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We will see you soon.  </p><p> Coming up, a shake-up at the top of General Electric, details on the new  chairman and CEO who replaces Jeff Immelt.</p><p> And parents check the pantry.  Chef Boyardee is recalling thousands of cans  of a childhood classic.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news this morning -- a change at the top of General  Electric.</p><p> Cheryl Casone has more details -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right -- Dagen.</p><p> GE CEO Jeff Immelt is retiring ending a 16-year run as the leader of the  industrial conglomerate.  He's going to be replaced by John Flannery in  August, who is currently the President and CEO of GE Health Care.  The move  was expected by some people who follow GE.  General Electric says that  Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the  year.  Flannery is going to take on the title of chairman on January 1st.</p><p> Now Immelt has taken steps to reshape GE after the financial crisis but the  company has struggled to boost profits.  GE shares are rallying though on  the premarket on the news, up 3.61 percent as you can see on your screen.   GE, a stock to watch today.</p><p> We are also watching this for you.  More than 700,000 pounds of Chef  Boyardee products are s being recalled.  The canned pasta and other  products are being recalled because of mislabeling.  The spaghetti meatball  products were determined also to contain milk but that's not listed on  label.  That's the big problem.  All these products have establishment  number, est.794 m inside the USCA inspection marks, so you have to kind of  look for it.  Chef Boyardee products are made by Conagra Brands, we should  say.</p><p> Well, Warren Buffett charity lunch selling for $2.68 million this year.   And anonymous fan of Buffett agreed to pay the amount at a five-day eBay  auction which drew 41 bids.  The winner and up to seven friends going to  dine with Buffett at the Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse in Manhattan.  The  money also, we should going to charity, the San Francisco charity Glide has  always been the benefactor of Mr. Buffett's Warren lunch.</p><p> And some lucky winner out there is holding the ticket to $447 million.  The  Powerball ticket matching all six numbers was sold in southern California  on Saturday.  Whoever owns it is going to claim the tenth largest lottery  prize in U.S. history.  The California lottery said in a statement that the  winning ticket was sold at Marietta Liquor and Deli in a very small city of  Menifee, California.  It can be redeemed starting today.  The winner has a  year and we shall see if they come forward hopefully soon.</p><p> And those are your headlines.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up the diplomatic crisis in Qatar roiling the oil markets -- we're  looking at the long term implications.</p><p> And the CEO of GolfTEC swinging by -- how the golf giant is refreshing its  brand for a new generation.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The cost of crude oil and why you care about it, because again,  that is what you put into your tank.  Oil up 1.5 percent right now -- up  about 69, 70 cents a barrel but still well below that $50 a barrel mark.   It's been a rough few weeks for the cost of crude falling nearly 10 percent  over the last three weeks.</p><p> Joining us now Schork Report founder Stephen Schork.  Stephen -- do you  expect this weakness to continue?  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, SCHORK REPORT:  Well, right now, Dagen -- if we are going  to see any sort of rebound in price it has to happen now.  From a technical  standpoint we are in a critical range, that is, oil between the price of  $45 and $47 a barrel.</p><p> I do expect it to hold.  Demand has never been stronger for crude oil in  this country.  It is now the middle of June.  We are ramping up going into  the peak summer driving demand season so crude oil at its highest with  regard to demand.  The gasoline demand about to surge.</p><p> And with oil down at a level that so a critical range and so into that Wall  Street -- Wall Street went all in on higher oil prices after November's  OPEC meeting.  They were wrong.  They've reset.  They've been exorcised  (ph) out of the market so there's a lot of bullets sitting on the side of  Wall Street so between oil $45, $47, I do expect this range hold in the  here and now going into the summer.  Beyond the summer, it's another  question.  </p><p> BLOCK:  Hey, Stephen -- it's Michael Block.  You know, we can talk about  supply and demand.  We saw the inventory data which, you know, is a  windshield smacking bugs last week, frankly.  But, you know, the other  issue is yes, the Saudis are not the, you know -- they're not the lever  they used to be but, you know, there is some concern I'm getting from some  clients that the tension between the Saudis and Qatar is undermining the  viability of the OPEC agreement.  If there is some, you know, peace reached  here, so to speak, do you think that can be a catalyst to move out in this  range to the upside?  </p><p>SCHORK:  Not really, Michael.  I think the rift between Saudi and Qatar is  actually a bearish event.  Qatar accounts for less than 2 percent of OPEC's  production.  If Qatar were in the United States it would only be the fourth  largest producer in the United States alone.</p><p> So from a geopolitical standpoint, what we are seeing now with this rift is  once again never far from the surface, is a 1,400-year-old chasm or shall  we say the 50-year-old chasm between the Sunni side of OPEC and the Shia  side of OPEC.</p><p> And of course with Sunni Saudi taking it to the Iranian-backed Qatar Shia,  this is indeed a rift that's going to pull into question the cohesion of  OPEC.  And if you were bullish oil with regard to OPEC, you have to be very  concerned because the cartel failed miserably to balance the market in the  first six months this year.  And that's the problem because I said earlier,  the demand for crude oil here in the United States has never been stronger.</p><p> So what is going to happen in the months ahead regardless of any sort of  unity back within the cartel when over the next couple of months demand  begins to fall back off here especially in the United States and the U.S.  producer is still going to put on an extra 200,000-barrels a day of  production by the end of this year.</p><p> So at this point we are still looking at a market that is well-glutted.  So  you have to ask yourself, if OPEC could not balance the market when demand  has never been stronger, how are they going to balance it when that demand  begins to fall off towards the end of the summer while U.S. shale producers  are adding another 200,000 barrels to the market?  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Stephen -- Mitch Roschelle here.  Is there a price range where  they can turn the switch on and off sort of right now at 46 and a half --  but where is the price point where they stop production?  Where is the  price point when they start production?  </p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that curve is starting to fall further and further lower to  the chagrin of oil bulls.  So what we can say with confidence by looking at  things like the rig counts, whichever is in 50 in the last 54 weeks, you  look at the CFTC data, what the upstream guys are doing as far as hedging.</p><p> And we could also infer from the price handed back into the curve.  That  oil in that $55, $56, $57 range is when you bring a lot of production back  to the fore and we've indeed seen it.  So we know there's a lot of oil  hedged forward in that $55, $57 range.</p><p> And with the cost cover what we are seeing is they are places now that are  coming online that are making money now at that sub $50 level.  So we keep  on lowering the bar here.  Where we are now $45, $47 you would expect to  see some of that production curtail.  And if we do see further weakness as  you get through the peak summer demand season, clearly this would have an  impact.</p><p> But to answer your question to be clear on this we know $55, $56 oil is  like ringing the dinner bell for producers and anything between that and  $45 you start to see diminishing returns on production.</p><p> So it wouldn't be until you saw production -- excuse me, price well below  $40 that you would see any sort of significant knock-on to a pullback in  production.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great analysis as always.  Stephen -- you covered the world.   You covered it all for us in terms of oil.</p><p>Stephen Schork -- thank you so much.</p><p>SCHORK:  Great to be here.

He's  expected to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee over Russia  election meddling concerns.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If I'm Jeff Sessions, I'm asking question -- the same  questions after hearing Jim Comey's testimony, I want to say, \"Why didn't I  know what was in those memos at the time you were writing them?  I'm your  boss.\"  And I think he's probably going to come raise those questions and  explain that he wasn't able to do his job as Attorney General because Jim  Comey was not for whatever reason reporting to him.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What Sessions' appearance tomorrow means for the administration,  that's ahead.  </p><p> The testimony comes as Sessions' predecessor Loretta Lynch comes under fire  herself.

But right here right now, Attorney General Jeff  Sessions set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee tomorrow,  the same panel that heard from fired FBI Chief James Comey last week.  But  what we don't know yet is whether the America people will actually hear  that testimony, watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER:   Don't know whether it's going to be public and I challenge the jurisdiction  to some extent, I'm on both committees as you know.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Judiciary and intelligence.</p><p> FEINSTEIN:  And -- yes.  And I believe that the judiciary committee has the  oversight responsibility for the Justice Department and therefore it is  very fitting for the Attorney General to appear there.  I've written two  letters to Senator Grassley suggesting that.</p><p> SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK), INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER:  We have not  disclosed and finalized a public or private.  I assume that this will be  public but we're still in that final conversation time with Jeff Sessions.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now to weigh in on that and so much more, Fox News  Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  What do you think the  Attorney General be -- do you think he'll be testifying in public or  private?</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I don't know  which way they're going to go.  It's a little bit of inside the beltway in  the weeds whether he testifies before the Intelligence Committee or the  Judiciary.</p><p> My own view is Senator Feinstein is right, the Senate Judiciary Committee  has lawful oversight responsibility over the Justice Department, the  Intelligence Committee has lawful oversight over the Intelligence  Community, not over the Justice Department.  But it's an unusual testimony  because he's not going to be testifying as the Attorney General telling  them about a probe that he's conducting.  He's going to be testifying as a  witness about what he saw and heard and did, not about what the Justice  Department is doing that is fraught with danger for him should he ever have  to become a witness again.</p><p> So the question is, has he already spoken to the person for whom he may be  a witness, Bob Mueller who works for him.  This is a very, very unusual  situation.  Bob Mueller is beneath Jeff Sessions in the Justice Department,  Bob Mueller's conducting the investigation that Jeff Sessions is prohibited  from being involved in because he's a potential witness in the  investigation.  So if he's going to dispute some of the things that Former  FBI Director Jim Comey says and he does this in private, it's not going to  have the political effect that the president wants.  If he does it in  public, well then the democrats are going to try to embarrass him by  accusing him of perjury because he supposedly didn't tell the Judiciary  Committee about all the needs he have with the Russian Ambassador, do you  get all that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And all -- I love it you could love without it.  I love  when you laugh.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It is in the weeds, it is also untrod territory, I know of no  comparison in modern American political history to the situation that the  president, the Attorney General, the former Attorney General, and the  former FBI Director are in at this moment.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the FBI Director Comey raised -- seem to raise and it's not  clear what he was alluding to but in his testimony last week, he raised the  possibility of other concerns about Jeff Sessions.  His dealings with  Russia during the campaign because he said that the FBI leadership before  his discussions recusal was (inaudible) that I can't discuss in an open  setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia related  investigation problematic.</p><p> Now we don't really know if this was -- it just raised an issue that  certainly Sessions needs to address or that the senators who want to --  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well you ask very prudently in the intro to this segment, why  didn't Jim Comey tell his boss Jeff Sessions about the memos involving the  communications from the president and if Jim Comey believe that the  president had ordered him, though the president as we know according to  Comey didn't use the word order to lay off General Flynn, why didn't he go  to the Attorney General?</p><p> Answer from Jim Comey, I was aware of matters material to the Attorney  General which told me and career lowers in the Justice Department he was  going to be out of the case and we didn't want to prejudice him or it by  telling him that.  We'll see if that's a valid explanation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -- and it wasn't just Attorney General Sessions that I was  referring to, I meant anybody up the chain of command in terms of Comey  saying to someone in Justice, even to Rod Rosenstein, I -- this was said to  me by President Trump to hope, comment, and there's a problem there or even  going to the White House --  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  There's a bit of a timeline issue there because Rod  Rosenstein, he doesn't come in until the end of April and then early comes  --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Okay.  Well anybody at Justice, right?  That's my point.  Like  if it was problem, why didn't he speak out?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well these are their questions.  Look, I thought Comey's  testimony was credible and compelling but not without its flaws, not  without cracks that someone challenging him would have an opportunity to  address. </p><p> What was new to the public but not new to those of us who monitor these  things was the criticism of Loretta Lynch.  I mean he has accused her of  misconduct in office.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well let's go to that.  So in the wake of Jim Comey's testimony,  Attorney General Loretta Lynch instructed him to downplay the significance  of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.</p><p> Senators -- he was running as the judges pointing out the joke was the  Federal Bureau of Matters, not the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   Senators on both sides of the aisle are now calling for an investigation,  watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FEINSTEIN:  I would have a queasy feeling too though to be candid with you.   I think we need to know more about that and there's only one way to know  about it and that's to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that.</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  The Attorney General's office has  become a political office, that's bad for us all.  So I want to get to the  bottom of that and it should be in Judiciary.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Judge, what could possibly come out of anything in the  investigation?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Well she could be indicted for misconduct in office.  I mean  he has laid out a case that she made decisions that to move the levers of  power in the Justice Department based upon the political needs of Barrack  Obama and the Clinton campaign.</p><p> The only evidence he has given for that are two things, the meeting with  Bill Clinton, we all know about that in the Tarmac in Phoenix which is  still unexplained and in y view probably unexplainable in that context.   But the effort to get the FBI to see the same language that the Clinton  campaign was using to characterize the FBI investigation and Mrs. Clinton,  language which is alien to law enforcement and alien to the FBI by calling  it a matter.  We don't do matters, we do criminal investigations.  He  eventually said when he had enough of this might very well be misconduct in  office.  The use of federal law enforcement for a domestic political  purpose would conduct -- would constitute a misconduct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He held back no punches.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Bottom line, as a result of his testimony, there were at  least two or three more investigations which will commence.  But the newest  one, the one we're talking about to Obama people not of Trump people.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Incredible.  Judge --  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Staying on top of it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love it you're here.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Totally.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love all the time I've gotten to spend with you in the last  week.  </p><p> NAPOLITANO:  It was beautiful.  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Judge Andrew Napolitano covering it all for you.  Coming up, a  bumpy ride ahead for Uber, the fallout as another one of the company's top  executives reportedly faces pressure to resign.</p><p> And GOLFTEC teeing up big changes, the company CEO joining us to talk about  how new tech can improve your gold game.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uber could be facing some major changes at the top after a  highly anticipated board meeting, Tracee Carrasco has all the details, good  morning Tracee.</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  Now, Uber's board  of directors met on Sunday to discuss all of its recent issues on the  table.  A possible leave of absence for embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and  the potential resignation of Chief Business Officer, Emil Michael.</p><p> A leave of absence for Kalanick comes at a time of both personal and  professional turmoil.  Now the 40-year-old mother recently died in a  boating accident at the end of May, his father was also injured in the  accident and Kalanick has been tending to him.  And just last week, race-y  memo Kalanick sent to Uber employee in 2013 was released and then in  February Kalanick was also seen in a video yelling at an Uber driver.  As  per Michael, he could resign as early as today.  Now, that's according to a  report from the Wall Street Journal.  If you remember in 2014 Michael  suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition to dig into the personal  lives of journalists who reported negatively about Uber.  </p><p> Michael's departure is said to be related to an internal investigation into  Uber's workplace culture by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.   Holder's investigation comes after 20 manager and other employees were  fired last week for claims of harassment, discrimination, and bullying,  Holder's recommendations for the company were presented at from his board  meeting which could also include a new HR process training and to address  the future of key executive including Emil Michael and Travis Kalanick.   Now, Uber has not issued any comments on these recent developments.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well -- and Michael, just to open up to the panel, this race is  an issue about if Kalanick has to step aside at least for a short time,  take a leave of absence.  Who's running the show over there given the  turmoil, given the management shakeup that is still ongoing?</p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  What I want to  know is -- I'll start up by asking a question Tracee, how prevalent is this  sort of culture in Silicon Valley?</p><p> We always hear that everyone in Silicon Valley is so open-minded.  There  seems to be this entitlement like we're talented programmers and creators  of these businesses, therefore we can run wild frankly.  It sounds like a  very frat boy type culture.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mitch can answer that.  Not that you're a frat boy but -- I mean  he's worked with --  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  I was.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I mean, that's what you do for a living, you're a consultant.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you would have a sense of how Uber's personal -- culture if  you will.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The interesting thing about Uber that people forget is the  headquarter staff is different than everybody we're dealing with every day,  right?</p><p> BLOCK:  Of course.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I'm talking about the management team and the corporate  culture.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  It could be culture problem driving and driving and driving, no  pun intended towards the goal of creating that company and it's just  created a very unusual environment that you don't see in too many other  enterprises because there's story after story after story there.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Well Kalanick after that viral video, he did come out and  apologize and said, \"I need to grow up, I need to be a little more mature.\"   And I think that's one of the things we're really seeing.  He's 40-years- old running this company and I think --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I know within Silicon Valley people who work at other  companies have been for a long time very uncomfortable with what was going  on at Uber and you can see -- and then this is even before you begin to  really see it on the outside with the reporter who was essentially tracked  with the executive who had the medical records of a rape victim in India.   With -- I mean just more and more keeps bubbling up and coming out.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, regardless.  I mean people actually -- given this culture,  I'm an Uber user, I might be too stubborn or lazy to actually change my  current app and move over to service such as Lyft.  I don't know if it's  enough to get me to move.  </p><p> I just want -- when you want a car, hello, I'm here.  Come pick me up.  I'm  not sure that I'm thinking of, \"Oh my gosh, what has the CEO -- what has he  done?\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If the service was better --  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Then I would give --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If the service was super great and people would be so quick to  move over to Lyft and there are a lot of -- I mean you talk about this,  there are a lot of other services, just the taxi -- like taxi and limousine  commission here in New York City is really trying to --  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And they have an app now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I've used it once, never again.  Tracee thank you so  much.  Tracee Carrasco all over the Uber story.</p><p> Coming up, get your game out of rot, the CEO of GOLFTEC will join us to  talk what is next for the golf instructing giant.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (inaudible) outright lead at 15 and a left edge cut for  Berger. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In case you missed it, that was Daniel Berger winning the PGA  Tour as FedEx St. Jude classic yesterday in Tennessee, Berger shot a 10  under to win the cup.</p><p> And now that summer is almost here, golfers are looking to brush up their  gold skills.  Let's bring in CEO of GOLFTEC, Joe Assell.  Joe, good to see  you.  Tell us all about what you guys are up to.</p><p> JOE ASSELL, CEO, GOLFTEC:  Good morning Dagen, thank you for having me.   Well we are on quite a roll right now.  Our business has been growing for  years in a row but we decided it was time to get even better and evolve as  a company and we rolled out quite a few new things this year with an  enhanced way to sell golf clubs and a rebrand and a refresh to our customer  experience when they come to see us.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mitch Roschelle has a question being an avid golfer himself.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  And I probably need all the lessons I can get.  Joe,  there are headwinds or maybe in golf speak I should say like a two-club win  in the golf business.  We're seeing rounds going down, country clubs are  shuttering just because there's not as much demand.  Is your business sort  of immune to that or is your business the solution to it?</p><p> ASSELL:  I think a little bit of both.  So our sales have gone straight up  for years, we're up a hundred percent the last seven years.  So it hasn't  been affecting us as much and we do think we're quite a bit of a solution.  </p><p> We gave 900,000 golf lessons last year and as people take lessons, they get  better and research shows as you get better, you play and spend a lot more.   So we definitely think we're part of the solution to help golf and it  really has been stabilizing lately.  Golfers are flat, new golfers last  year were more than -- it's the highest rate in 10 years of new people  entering the game and golf is starting to turn the corner a little bit  these days.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why do you suspect that Joe?  Is it just -- and I don't mean  this as an insult but as younger people are getting older and golf just  seems like -- it seems like a much more attractive sport, all the  incredibly technical and difficult, it's not as taxing on the body, it's  saying even playing tennis.</p><p> ASSELL:  Yes, you're right.  We have the baby boomers coming our way and  research shows that their golf spending doubles the day they retire and it  isn't as taxing and they can play golf and there's a forecast for increase  round by baby boomers.</p><p> But then you have new ways to play golf, you have topgolf, you have  simulators, and you have things that are attracting both the millennial  group right now and kids.  Golf was the fastest growing sport among girls  of any sport in America last year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Topgolf is fun.  Yes, I think there's one at the MGM Grand if my  memory serves --  </p><p> ASSELL:  Yes, there is.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So Joe, GOLFTEC is partnering with True Spec in creating new  golf clubs, can you tell us about GOLFTEC's place in the retail environment  and why did you start selling equipment?</p><p> ASSELL:  So you were number one in the world at golf lessons but to play  your best, you need a golf club to match that swing.  And we've always  (inaudible) but we thought it was time to really enhance how we do it.</p><p> And today, with the inner-changeability of heads and shafts, you have so  much more option variety to put two and tow tighter to make the best club  for you.  And then once you do that, you need somebody to build it for you  and True Spec is our assembly partner.  Once we dial in the exact shaft to  optimize performance for our customers, True Spec will put it together for  us.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Joe, the average GOLFTEC student drops seven strokes with their  scorecards, so is this cheating?  At what point is technology if the club  going to swing itself?  </p><p> ASSELL: I hope not, that would put us out of business.  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Be good for putters like me though.</p><p> ASSELL:  You know, golf is hard -- golf is hard and it's great for business  but for us, when we combine big data with proprietary software, with PGA  pros, it works and our students really quite a bit.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, I need all the help I can get.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joe, real quick, prediction for the U.S. Open.</p><p> ASSELL:  Well it can be a very long golf course and they've never had a  major championship there so no one really knows what it will bring.</p><p> But I think a long hitter and then the other big aspect this week is  there's a lot of land and the holes are really far apart and there's a lot  of walking from one hole to the next and it's going to take some stamina,  so I lean towards a younger player, a more fit player who's a long hitter.   So it wouldn't surprise me at all if Dustin Johnson repeats this year from  last year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ah, you took the words out of my mouth.  By the way, I worked on  a golf course but I drove the beverage cart.</p><p> ASSELL:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When I was -- after I got my college degree by the way.  So you  see how much my college degree was --  </p><p> ASSELL:  That's a great summer job.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it was.  Unfortunately I just gotten BA.  Joe, it was great  to see you.  Joe Assell.  And we're going to be live from the U.S. Open in  Erin Hills Thursday and Friday morning.  Yes, Maria Bartiromo at the U.S.  Open.  Thursday and Friday, the whole show 6:00am to 9:00, we'll be right  back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.

Getting the agenda back on track, President  Trump expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin, tomorrow.  The move  comes as the White House moves past the controversy surrounding Jim Comey's  testimony last week.  First Daughter, Ivanka Trump, was asked on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" earlier about her father's response to that controversy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  My father felt very  vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels  incredibly optimistic but, you know, at the White House and throughout the  administration we were incredibly focused on the reason we all went to  Washington.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.</p><p>TRUMP:  And what we're fighting for.  So last week, while it didn't get the  level of headlines, it will ultimately have a much more important impact,  it was infrastructure week, focusing on the commitment to rebuild this  country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  More from Ivanka Trump's interview ahead.

These big names, your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and  Microsoft had been your major market leaders, pulling the rest of the  market along all year and they took a beating on Friday and many of them  lower in premarket trading.</p><p> In Europe, stocks also heading south, we have a one percent loss in France  and in Germany.

Immelt out.  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEADER:  I'm interested  to see what happens with those big tech names because if they start to  continue to sell off, they're so heavy in the indices, that it could start  dragging the market down and start getting everybody worried that Trump  rally is a thing of the past.  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Dated.  NASDAQ down 1.8 percent on Friday.  We'll see if we get  some follow through today to see if there's a sector rotation, as the  NASDAQ is pulling back, the Dow has been hitting new all-time highs.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: And the Russell 2000, the small-cap stocks (INAUDIBLE) a record  on Friday.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  That's a good story though.  </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  The Russell caught  up too.  Yes.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Yes. </p><p> BLOCK:  Russell caught up because everyone was shorted?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL: Sector rotation. </p><p> BLOCK:  No, no.  It's squeezing.  Full state of rotation continues.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And the Fed is hiking this week.  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  Very important.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  I mean, take that one to the bank I think what Jon  Hilsenrath would have done.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  -- got lost in the headlines when you never know what happens  with Sessions' testimony.  So .</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll keep it in the headlines right here on Fox Business as we  always do.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We can talk about everything.  Joining the conversation this  morning, former Texas Congressman Presidential Candidate, Ron Paul, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Mr. Stuart Varney.  We always love to see Mr.  Varney.  To our story this hour, today is the deadline for parties  challenging the president's travel ban to respond to a petition from  justice department. </p><p> The petition asks the Supreme Court to allow the president's executive  order to go into effect.  Despite opposition, Texas Attorney General Ken  Paxton says the president has the right to enact this ban.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We think we're absolutely right on the  law, there's a federal law that clearly gives the president the authority  to do this.  This travel ban is right in line with that statute.  And so,  we're confident if the court actually follows federal law, that the  president will be just fine.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is the co-founder of Diligence LLC, former CIA  Operative Mike Baker.  I don't even know where you are but I know you  parachuted in or tunneled in.  </p><p> MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  He can't tell you where he is.  I'm at  the - I'm at the compound right now.  It's a secret - it's a secret  location except I got a picture of it behind me.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is why you have to - this is why you have to follow Mike on  Twitter because it's always like he's on a - like a gator boat, like a fan  boat coming in.</p><p> BAKER:  Get in your boat -- </p><p> MCDOWELL: Mike, is these bans a significant step in focusing on national  security?  </p><p> BAKER:  Well, you know, it's become this outsized thing that is chewing up  a lot of political capital and a lot of - a lot of attention and it really  didn't need to, it's important and it - and it should be done, and the  previous administration, you know, the Obama administration had identified  and outlined the same problem but because of the messaging issues, the  discipline coming out of the White House in this current administration,  it's unfortunately - it's taken on this concept that somehow the travel ban  is critical for national security.  Well, it's an element of national  security.</p><p> It is a very simple process, you've got these states, these nations that  are essentially failed states.  And the previous administration agreed and  the idea being is, well, let's take a break, let's review internally our  processes for how we -- how we do a the vetting, how we do the due  diligence, the background checking on people who want to come to this  country from these particular failed states, where there's no  infrastructure, there's no ability to reach in and in a logical and  efficient manner, check databases and talk to people to understand who are  these people that want to come in.</p><p> It's s simply that and then once you do that, fine, improve your systems  and the suspension is over.  But that's not the way it works, so it's  become this thing that like I said is just chewing up a tremendous amount  of political capital.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  At the same time that you have this new developing diplomatic  crisis in the Middle East with Qatar, now hiring Former Attorney General  John Ashcroft in response to accusation that the nation supports terror  groups in the region.  Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf nations cut  diplomatic ties with Qatar last week over the terror allegations, Egyptian  billionaire businessman Naguib Sawiris backing the decision on Wall Street  Week when he talked to Maria on Friday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Tell us  why you're advising your colleagues in business to take their money out of  Qatar right now?  </p><p> NAGUIB SAWIRIS, EGYPTIAN BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN:  Well, I'm not just  advising them to take their money out to Qatar, I'm advising them not to  deal with Qatar, point, you know, because we are all watching every day, we  wake up hearing a lunatic that - or a savage person that went -- goes with  the car and kills innocent people or like in my own country here, they stop  the bus with children and women and shot the - shot the men in front of the  eyes of the women and every day we hear all these incidents, you know.</p><p> And nobody is doing anything against it and we need to come to the bottom  of that and the -- one country that declares openly that it is supporting  terror, you know, like Hamas or other organizations that's siding with Iran  openly that all intelligence services of the world have all materials  showing that they're supporting all the terrorists and extremist groups in  Middle East from Libya, in Syria, in Iraq and everywhere.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike, what is this rift in Qatar mean for us because again, this  comes on the heels of Obama-backed and brokered Iranian nuclear deal.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  And then - and, you know, that sound bite there, gave away  the sort of the reason why this has exploded into an issue, and it's Iran.   So this is essentially at the top line, a conflict between the Saudis and  Iran, and the Saudis, Iran obviously has their Lex Luthor and, you know,  they are locked in this battle for influence and in the region.  So the  Saudis have exerted a great deal of pressure on some of these other  countries that Egypt included to isolate Qatar.</p><p> You know, the truth of the matter is that, you know, they're all complicit  in different ways over different periods of time and either financing or  somehow supporting or looking the other way in terms of Islamic extremism.   So Qatar doesn't stand alone in that and what needs to happen and what's  going to be extremely difficult is, you know, the U.S. in particular, we're  going to need to find a way to step into that breach and bring them back  together in a fashion because we're not going to - we're not going to do  this, we're not going to beat terrorism by isolating Qatar.</p><p> You know, we've got a military base there, and different things can be true  at the same time in Middle East.  You can be working with a partner out  there who on one hand, at a one side of their mouth helps you with certain  terrorist operations or providing intelligence, to us and our liaise on  partners, at the same time there can be elements within that government  that sympathize or support terrorism or business that do same thing.  You  got, you know, you got to deal with, you know, the world is that exists and  not try to find some perfect ending.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And Mike, Mitch Roschelle, with all those Sunni-Shia conflict  that's going on, doesn't Iran just need trading partners and maybe they  were looking to make a friend in Qatar because there's so many players in  the region that just will trade with them and they need trading partners?</p><p> BAKER:  Well, sure, they like as many trading partners as possible but, you  know, over the top of that is the fact that Iran is doing it for the  regime's best interest which is to drive a wedge between these countries  and to try to degree possible to pull them out of the Saudi sphere.  Again,  this is - this is a Saudi-Iranian dispute.  I wouldn't ascribe any sort of  innocent economic reasoning behind anything that the Iranian regime does.</p><p> So I think - I think your take on it, while there is an element of economic  truth there, the reality is it's more nefarious than that.  </p><p> BLOCK:  Mike, what's the - what's the endgame for Qatar here?  Because  they've been very Machiavellian I would say, they play from both sides,  they're friends with everybody that have Al-Jazeera, you know (INAUDIBLE)  they deal with Iran, they were dealing with the west - we have the big base  there, you know, it sounds like probably they're getting called on playing  both sides here.  How does this end for them?  Is there something that  taunts where that continues or is the line drawn and they have to choose a  side or have a side chosen for them?  </p><p> BAKER:  No.  I don't think it's going to be a hardline decision at the end  where they, you know, that's it, there's a final break from, you know, from  the -- sort of this traditional alliance where, you know, to some degree  they have been aligned with UAE and Egypt and the others, and Saudis.  I  think what will happen is -- I hope what will happen is that there will be  a significant diplomatic effort led by Rex Tillerson and some others.</p><p> And at the end of the day, we'll heal the rift to some degree, they'll open  the borders, there will be business but we have to be pragmatic and  understand that, you know, again, there will be this duplicity that exists,  so that's not just - again, it's not just Qatar.  I mean, look at the  Saudis in the way over the time they dealt with the devil, they've turned  the other way and in terms of allowing the extremism to build in exchange  for, you know, stability within the kingdom.</p><p> So, you know, the Middle East is one of those places where, you know, it's  on satisfactory but you have to deal with who exists there and you have to  understand it would be very, very hard line pragmatic about this to  understand that they're going to be duplicities in the way that they act  when it comes to extremism.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Mike, when you leave, do you ignite your jet propulsion pack  since why you're sitting in the state.  Why right out? </p><p> BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.  We tend to - everything disappears, you know, it's a  little bit like Mr. Wolfe, you know, you got to clean the place up and then  you go and, you know, and you find another place where we can do another  segment.  But yes, it's - it is what it is.  Look, I'm out in Idaho, I'm  going to release that information to the public, I was going to give it to  a friend and then you're going to hand it the press but I'm in Idaho, and  anybody out there watching hasn't been to Idaho, I'm here to tell you, it's  one of the greatest states in the nation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It really is.  It is stunningly beautiful but I would deeply,  deeply appreciate your Winston Wolfe reference.  </p><p> BAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike Baker.  Big love always.  Mike Baker joining us.</p><p> BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A scare in the air for flyers aboard at flight to  Shanghai, a plane forced to turn around after a hole rips open in the  engine.  And a shake-up at the top of General Electric, Jeff Immelt out.   We look at future of this company because the road since he took over in  '01 was a lo rocky one.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news this morning.  General Electric getting a new  leader.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey Dagen,  that's right.  G.E. CEO Jeff Immelt is retiring, he's ending a 16-year run  as the leader of industrial conglomerate.  He's going to be replaced by  John Flannery in August who's currently the president and CEO of G.E.  Healthcare.  Now, the possible move first reported by our very ow3n Charlie  Gasparino.  He broke that news on the tensions between Immelt and activist  investor Nelson Peltz.</p><p> That report from Charlie - excuse me, was back in March.  General Electric  says Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the  year.  Flannery going to take on that title, January 1st.  Immelt has taken  steps to reship - reshape G.E. after the financial crisis for the company.   They have struggled a boost profit there.  As you can see, there is the  stock in the premarket, it is rallying.  G.E. shares are rallying up a  little more than three percent.  That will actually help balance out the  Dow when we open up at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.  </p><p> Also, we're following this story for you.  A huge hole in a China Eastern  plane forced an emergency landing in Australia.  Passengers of the flight  from the city to Shanghai said the engine made a massive amount of noise  right after takeoff.  Pilots reported problems about an hour into the  journey.  The plane had to return to Sydney, it land safely.  Passengers  were evacuated from plane but luckily, there were no injuries there.</p><p> Well, a Trump t-shirt censored in a high school yearbook.  Grant Berardo  took his high school pictures in New Jersey wearing Trump campaign shirt,  this is Make America Great Again but the t-shirt was later digitally  altered to remove the campaign slogan in the actual yearbook.  The school  superintendent is investigating this, says there is no policy prohibiting  political messages in schools pictures.</p><p> And then this, passengers on a recent Delta Airlines flight got a big  surprise.  Former President Jimmy Carter was on board and before the plane  took off, he walked up and down the aisle shook hands with passengers.   They were really excited.  There you go.  This is the tweeted video shows  the 92-year-old former president smiling as he walked down the aisle.  He  greets everybody.  The passenger tweeted the video, said, everybody seemed  really excited.  And the overall sense it was just really nice to have that  kind of moment where party or politics \"Didn't matter.\"  One of the most --  I think revered ex-presidents we have living today, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) but a cancer survivor, you know, he went on one of  these Immunotherapy drugs from the Kansas spread to his brain spectacular  until -</p><p> CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  And look at him.</p><p> MCDOWELL: Spectacular --</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL: -- recovery.  I wish the president talked more about that  actually.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up.  The Penguins iced the  Predators to keep the cup in Pittsburg.  Highlights from the repeat NHL  title victory in nearly 20 years.</p><p> And bling with a zing, how to Patriots are using their Super Bowl reign to  remind the Falcons off their incredible comeback in February.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The hockey season coming to a close after an exciting Stanley  Cup final between the Penguins the Predators.  Jared Max is here with the  highlights.  Hey, Jared.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 AMERICAN SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.   I thought we were headed for sudden death overtime last night.  0-0 game  until under two minutes remaining.  Game six Stanley Cup final in  Nashville, the Predators fans continue their tradition, throwing catfish on  the ice and it looked like the Predators had reeled in the first goal of  the game.  Colton Sissons taps it in after Pittsburg goalie Matt Murray was  unable to control Filip Forsberg's shot.  1-0 Predators, right?  Wrong!</p><p> Officials had lost sight of the puck and one blew a whistle to signal the  play dead, fraction of a second before the puck went in.  0-0 to the third  and then the Penguins get this weird goal from behind the net, the former  Predator Patric Hornqvist sneaks it past Pekka Rinne, this goal counted.   Penguins 1-0, a minute later they scored through an empty net.  Celebration  was on a first time in era of salary cap.  One team wins the Stanley Cup  two straight seasons.  Penguins' parade will be this week.  No official  date yet.</p><p> Could be preparing for another championship parade and NBA one for the  Golden State Warriors soon.  Warriors up three games to one and the  Cavaliers favored to win tonight by 8.5 points, tip off scheduled for just  after 9:00 Eastern in Oakland.  We all know Air Jordans are not cheap  sneakers but what about a pair of real about Michael Jordans?  As in sneaks  worn by the basketball legend in his final game as an amateur.  Well, the  sneakers that Jordan wore in the gold medal game in the '84 Olympics at  Spain sold at auction yesterday for $190,373.  Almost 200 grand.  Yes,  highest known price paid for game-worn shoes.  I even had Jordans orthotics  and the autograph.</p><p> Back page of the New York Post today asks the question, he hit it how far?   New York Yankees star Aaron Judge, longest homerun in Major League Baseball  since ESPN began tracking distance of homeruns in 2009.  Watch this.  Now  Judge hit two homeruns in the Yankees 14-3 win over Orioles.  This was his  first.  It traveled 4696 feet.  He is first Yankees since Mickey Mantle in  1956 two hit homers in the same game, he goes four for four, first Yankees  since Roger Maris, age 25 or younger to hit 20 homeruns before the all-star  break.  Judge has 21, he's batting 344. </p><p> Football.  You know, football said to be the sport of kings, better than  diamond rings but maybe not this ring.  Check this out, past Friday night;  New England Patriots owner Robert Craft hosted a private ceremony for his  players and team members at his home.  Well, they all got their  championship rings.  Remember that 28 to 3 comeback against the Atlanta  Falcons in Super Bowl?  So, 283 rings to recognize the 28 to 3 comeback.   283 diamonds are on this ring, it totals 5.1 carats.  And all Tom Brady  showing it off along with Martellus Bennett.  So they have a 28 to 3, a  little bit of a dig at the Falcons and also a couple of quotes on the  rings, as well from Bob Craft, the team owner, unequivocally the sweetest  and also greatest comeback all-time.  How about those rings?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can't wear them all at the same time.  </p><p> BLOCK:  It should have had two big diamonds on them to represent the two  times they couldn't beat the Giants in Super Bowl.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p> MAX:  I like that.  I like that.  That's fair.  It's a good shot.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dropping the mic on that one, Mike.  Dropping the mic, Mike.  A  brain freeze attack on the baseball field video showing a young fan winning  a slurpy-sipping contest and that's going viral.

I'm not kidding, got brain  freeze and the next thing I knew I came to.  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Are you kidding?</p><p> MAX:  No.  Serious thing.  And then I let you know -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  It happened in New Orleans with the hurricane but that thing -  that was (INAUDIBLE)  </p><p> MAX:  Yes, yes, yes.  Different thing.  This had no alcohol in it.  But  yes, the brain that - it's not fun.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I thought that video was - it shows people why you should go to  Minor League Games.</p><p> MAX:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  like I, you know, brain freeze?</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  No, but they do really fun stuff but --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like fun promotions and it's really about the community and  local community and --  </p><p> MAX:  And watching baseball and not costing, you know, $400 for the family  for it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Right, exactly.  And not being a major headache against the  ballpark.  I mean - because that is part of it.  So hey, are you jealous?   Are you going to U.S. Open?</p><p> MAX:  I'm not.  I'm not going.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So are you jealous that we're going?  We're going to be -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MAX:  I'm a little bit jealous.  We can talk about that off the air.  </p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  I am very - now I'm very excited.  I'm super excited.  </p><p> MAX:  Will you guys be texting me like, \"Hey, what's an eagle?  What's a  double-eagle?</p><p> MCDOWELL: No.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I went to Wake Forest, as the home of Arnold Palmer, Lanny  Wadkins, Curtis Strange, Billy Andrade.  So I know my, Michael.  </p><p> MAX:  What's your handicap?  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Oh, I am a horrible golfer.  But I know, Michael.  </p><p> MAX:  Are you looking forward to?  It should be gorgeous.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: I love why -- there is nothing better than being on a course and  watching really incredible golf because you get to see firsthand, how  incredibly difficult it is.  </p><p> MAX:  Beautiful time of year also to be in Wisconsin.  Erin Hills looks to  be pretty gorgeous course.  </p><p> MCDOWELL: Oh my gosh.  Yes.  I love the people of Wisconsin, so open your  arms, people, we'll be there Thursday and Friday.

Blake Burman at the White House with more.  Good  morning, Blake. </p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Dagen.  Good morning to you as well.  Last week at the White House was  infrastructure week at a rollout.  It got a bit muddled once Jim Comey  headed to Capitol Hill.  This week, they have got a new focus somewhat of a  round two.  They will be focusing on workforce development.  The main push  here according to top officials, at the White House, is on trying to build  out apprenticeship to that end.  The President will be headed on the road  this week, tomorrow, he will be going to Wisconsin, speaking at a trade  school in Waukesha, Wednesday to Labor Department, Thursday, here at the  White House.  </p><p> He has a roundtable with several state governors.  This whole issue of  workforce development has been a push of Ivanka Trump.  She was on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" this morning to tout rollout administration will be having  throughout the week and she admitted that there has been -- as she put it a  level of visual viciousness in Washington, that caught her off guard. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> IVANKA TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER:  I didn't expect it to be easy.   I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was -- I was a  little blindsided by on a personal level. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURMAN:  So, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this workforce development roll  out, Dagen, Friday sources tell Fox that the President will end his  workweek in Miami where he will unveil his administration's policies as it  relates to Cuba.  You can expect at least somewhat of a rollback of the  Obama administration policies to that end.</p><p> By the way, later today here at the White House, the start off to the week  the President will have a full cabinet meeting.  All the members of his  cabinet.  Dagen, back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for covering all that for us.  Blake Burman at  the White House.  Joining us now is former Texas Congressman and Republican  Presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul.  Congressman, the President is set to  hold -- Blake mentioned, first full cabinet meeting today.  Do you think  this administration will now be able to move forward on the agenda that  Americans want the reason they voted for him? </p><p> RON PAUL, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN:  It is not likely but let's hope they  move forward on right things because everything they say is not exactly  going to solve all our problems.  I don't happen to believe public works  projects is a way to get more jobs.  You might get more jobs but it won't  be same as if you got more jobs in private sector.  They make a lot of  mistakes.  I think obstacles are so great and people don't recognize the  debt.  When you have a lot of debt, it's hard to spend money.  You come up  with a trillion dollars for military and a trillion dollars for public  works and repairing highways, where is the money going to come from?  And  this has an effect at marketplaces eventually.  If you look at how much  debt is out there whether it's automobile debt, college debt, personal debt  and even housing debt right now, I mean, there is a lot of problems so that  is why I think they are stymied because the fundamentals don't change.  You  can say these jobs -- the truth is dependent on government creating jobs or  there's something wrong with the plan.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I am going to push back in terms of the  infrastructure plan and I will and you call it public works.  I come on  that I know that means you mean to evoke FDR's programs of the depression. </p><p> PAUL:  I do, I do. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is what you say it but trillion dollars is not going to be  -- actually a minority of it would be government money.  Under the way, the  plan is laid out now.  They would -- Trump administration would get to  trillion largely in parts from funding through private investors and the  money is indeed out there.  It was $59 billion raised last year in private  infrastructure funds.  Their goal is too easy the permitting process, easy  regulations to get that money invested in projects alongside the  government. </p><p> PAUL:  Yes.  The easing of regulations is very good and that is getting out  of the way house in order, but this whole thing is partnership that bothers  libertarians because partnerships, big businesses big banks in government  isn't exactly what a free society is all about.  That is not what a  Republic is about because only favored people get to do the dealing.  So I  don't like partnership.  I want an environment where people can be  competitive and produce things that are necessary.  But saying that we are  going to have big government financing and big business financing, there is  a lot of shortcomings with that plan. </p><p> MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Dr. Paul, Mike  Block here.  You raised a very valid concerns about debt levels and  something people worry about except, I don't want to turn into a discussion  on bond market, the bond yields are not reflecting a lot of concern about  all this spending that you are talking about.  The capital markets have  this wrong?  Is there something else going on here? </p><p> PAUL:  Yes.  I think they do.  I am not an investor but just from an  economic viewpoint, I do.  You might have said tech stocks were good  investment and things happen in a flash and bond markets can happen that  way too, because all countries are in debt, and you know we have the  European problem where you have Greece, and Italy, and Spain having  problems but you are going to have something pop up.  It's going to be very  devastating but if you look at prices, when prices go high, when you have  inflation, it is dangerous.  So when you are saying bonds are pretty  comfortable, you are saying that there is euphoria in the bond market;  prices are very, very high; and I think it is where the bubble is right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I have been talking about that since 2009 and I  will admit I have been dead wrong.  Mitch, you got a question for the  congressman?  Saying that there is euphoria in the bond market prices are  very, very high.  And I think it is.  I have been talking about that --  congressman I have been talking about that since 2009, and I will admit I  have been dead wrong.  Mitch, a question for the Congressman? </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  You are not wrong, you are not  wrong.  But you can't predict his timing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maybe I will be right.  I am sleeping in the dark.  Congressman,  I want Mitch to get a question for you. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  OK.  When you look at the agenda with so few days really left  in Session, where are the priorities?  Is tax reform going to sort of fall  about by way sided something we go back and reduce rates to stimulate the  economy?</p><p> PAUL:  When you say end of the session you mean for summer break? </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes, correct. </p><p> PAUL:  That sort of thing? </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  No.  They are not going to get that done there's too many  special interests.  They should just be cutting, spending and cutting taxes  and if you can't cut it all one time cut something.  But no.  They want the  whole package which I understand.  But it's not enough agreement.   Everybody has their ax to grind.  It's going to be hard to get them  together besides a lot of Republicans are not dedicated to what I am  talking about.  They are dedicated to taking care of their friends.  I  mean, if -- you know, it takes medical care.  They have a lot of friends in  the insurance industry, and the drug industry.  </p><p> They are not liable to change that and cut down real spending.  They will  do their talking but, Dagen, when you start cutting back it is a problem.   I mean, it is hard to get an addict off drugs and that is what we're trying  to do.  First, I don't think they start with the basic principle.  The  government ought to be very limited and strive for that.  They say  government -- we just need better management.  I don't buy into that.  I  think we have too much mismanagement. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, real quick.  Heather.</p><p> HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Paul, the Federal  Reserve is set to hike interest rates this Wednesday.  A quarter basis  point.  You're talking about our debt levels.  What will that effect have  on interest rates to service this debt? </p><p> PAUL:  Oh it is going to being up, supposed the market has already  discounted that, but no, if they creep up, what would happen if we had a  market rate of interest which is what we need to get economy.  What if  interest rates were three percent?  This whole worldwide system would  collapse because everything depends on more and more and more now they are  tinkering a quarter point here, a quarter point there.  They are really not  doing a whole lot so I don't think this is a trend at all.  </p><p> I think this is wishful thinking.  I think that if you go up a little bit  more even if a little bit is going to be a bigger burden on the treasury.   This is where so much production has to go eventually with increase in  interest rates, and eventually interest rates will go up, then that pay all  the production.  We cannot pay it.  We cannot pay.  We have to print more  money! </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Keep printing.  Good to see you.  Congressman Ron Paul,  take care of yourself.  </p><p> Still ahead, do they protect too much?  Stuart Varney weighs in on the  outrage after New York City play used a President Trump look-alike in the  role of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  Why analysts are going sour on  Apple.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  GE shares jumping after the company announced CEO Jeff Immelt is  leaving.  Nicole Petallides covering the story at New York Stock Exchange.   Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We have this upside this  morning for General Electric looking up about three percent right now, 3.7  percent so good move for GE who's been under pressure and overall but needs  to cut costs and outperform a little bit.  It has been under pressure.   Shareholders were not too happy with Jeff Immelt particularly Trion funds  and so he will be stepping down and John Flannery who is a 30-year veteran  there will move up to the top spot of CEO and that will happen on August  1st.  And so GE gets a pop.</p><p> Watching also Microsoft which sold off of all tech stocks on Friday but  it's come out now about the new X-Box 1x.  OK, this is supposed to be their  smallest ever X-Box 499.  Everybody is waiting for this one.  It's supposed  to have the graphics and the memory and speed, bandwidth and sound as well  to really outpace the whole industry.  And that will be available in time  for the holidays.  </p><p> And last but not least, watching Apple which sold off in a big way on  Friday.  In fact, it's biggest selloff in 14 months weighed on Dow, shaved  off 41 points on Friday, it is down again cutting it this morning but still  saying it's going to be strong for the holiday season, still liking the  iPhone but this is really evaluation call because we have seen tech stocks  really run up.  And it's not even 5 percent of the 52-week high.  Back to  you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides in the New York  Stock Exchange.  Another controversy surrounding creative depictions of the  President.  Two sponsors, major corporations, pulling out of the  Shakespeare In The Park here in New York City after a production of Julius  Caesar shows a Donald Trump look alike being stabbed to death on the Senate  floor.  Again, it's a play.  It's Shakespeare.  So, who do we go to?   British man.  Host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY,\" Stuart.  Of course, you're  going to talk about Shakespeare this morning, my friend.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  You don't  know what to call me, do you?  You were just kind of lost there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to call you -- I was going to say, superstar. </p><p>VARNEY:  No let's not get crazy.  Look, I am picking up on what our viewers  are seeing on the left-hand side of the screen, Shakespeare in the Park.   It's really kind of pass, for New York but not voters in the rest of the  country.  I think they are appalled to see our President, a man looking  like our President being stabbed to death in Central Park for Shakespeare  in the Park.  The audience apparently just loved it.  That is New York, I  guess.  I think it is dangerous.  This comes on top of the severed head  from Kathy Griffin.  </p><p> I just think that we are leading the country in entirely the wrong  direction, leading it towards a violent confrontation between left and  right.  I don't think that is good for anybody.  But then, let's not forget  Democrat senator from New York over the weekend, dropping the \"f\" bomb in  public right there.  I have to believe that, that was focus group tried and  tested.  This is how you appeal to millennials, use obscene language.  I  think it is a dangerous situation, and I think it is something that voters  are going to reject.  That is where I am coming from. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I felt like when she said that, Stuart, it was the equivalent of  a 3-year-old making flatulent sounds.  They do it for attention. </p><p>VARNEY:  Juveniles.  The snickering going on in the audience and by her.   It is beneath the office of senator and it should not be taking place in  our country at this time.  </p><p> The level of public discourse is gone down at tubes and the level of  violence displayed against and the contempt displaced for our President  knows no bounds I think it's counterproductive for us all. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A British gentleman.  That's what I -- </p><p>VARNEY:  An American.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You are.  You are you are the -- the represent greatest that is  America in terms of the opportunities that this nation provides and how you  seized upon it cherish it, I mean that Stuart, you talk about it all the  time. </p><p>VARNEY:  Well thank you very much indeed, Dagen, I appreciate that I do  thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, we'll see you in exactly 10 minutes, Stuart,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Coming up  Uber, planning to put its troubles in the rear view mirror, a key executive  reportedly resigning amid questions about the company's workplace culture  the fallout for the ride-sharing giant. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The mastermind behind terror attacks on two landmarks in Iran  last week apparently has been killed.  Cheryl Casone has details on that. </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, so Dagen according to the  New York Times, the top official in Iran says that intelligence officers  hunted down and killed the man behind attacks in Iran.  ISIS said it is  behind the assault in Iran's parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah  Khomeini, the founder of Islamic Republic of course that killed 17 people  that attack while the newspaper says Iranian investigators are looking into  the attacks, increasingly focusing a on group of radicalized Iranian Kurds. </p><p> OK.  Back in here in home Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may temporarily step  aside this potential move coming on the heels of Uber's board of Directors,  adopting a series of recommendations about the company's corporate culture  from an internal investigation from former Attorney General Eric Holder.  </p><p> And a new federal audit showing that Medicare erroneously paid an estimated  $729 million to doctors and other health professionals.  The payments came  under a multibillion-dollar federal initiative to designed shift the health  care system from paper records to computers, the audit found that over  three year period Medicare improperly paid health professionals since that  they bonus payments under the initiative but in reality they either lacked  required proof or they failed to meet the criteria for the bonuses.  </p><p> And then one New Jersey couple had a surprise crasher at their wedding on  Saturday.  President Trump dropped by to congratulate Kristen Piatkowski  and Tucker Gladhill at his Bedminster golf club.  He danced with the bride,  he shook hands with the guests Trump well-known for joining wedding parties  at the resort said he runs, guess he used to run, you may recall back in  February he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped in on a wedding  reception in Mar-a-Lago.  So, you know, get married at the Bedminster in  Jersey and you'll never know who is going to show up, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So far that's pretty cool. </p><p> BLOCKS:  And Donald Trump. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes exactly, and the President of the United States doesn't  drink and so you don't need to worry about him, you know, hitting the open  bar, right?  So maybe the food tables, not the bar, coming up final  thoughts from our all-star panel. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Mitch.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Buckle up. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Michael Block.</p><p> BLOCK:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  How many years?  </p><p> BLOCK:  A lot.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p> ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe. MCDOWELL:  Thanks to Heather and Michael and Mitch, see you all.  And Maria  will be back tomorrow.  She's going to interview Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin at 7 a.m. Eastern time, and then we go to the U.S. open but right  now it's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

President Trump is expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin  tomorrow, this comes as the battle over tax reform and healthcare ramp up  Capitol Hill.</p><p>The outrage in the park, a New York City play uses a President Trump look- a-like for the role of the assassinated Julius Caesar, the fallout as both  Delta and Bank of America pull their sponsorships.</p><p>Uber under fire, the board of director is expected to unveil a massive  shake up following an investigation into the company's sexual harassment  scandal.  Several reports say that CEO, Travis Kalanick could take a leave  of absence while another key executive maybe out of a job, the details  ahead. </p><p>Futures are showing the start of a week with a lower open but you have the  DOW that closed at a record high on Friday.  The NASDAQ, those same stocks,  your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google, those were in the dunks on  Friday, we're going to dig in to that later this hour.  In Europe, stocks  are lower across the board, England, France, and Germany, they are the  biggest loser being the CAC krones and France but the DAX in terms of  selloff not far behind.  In Asia overnight, markets were all in the red as  well, a one and a quarter percent lost in the Hang Seng but you see red  across your screen in Asia to start this week.</p><p>A massive heat wave striking the U.S., record breaking temperature  stretching from Omaha to New York City, what you can expect for the rest of  the week coming up.  </p><p>And the Penguins putting the predators on ice, Pittsburgh topping Nashville  to win its second straight Stanley Cup, the highlights from the big game  ahead.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  With me, Financial  Analyst, Heather Zumarraga is back with us.  Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist, Michael Block, my friend it's been too long.  And PWC Partner,  Mitch Roschelle.  Welcome each and every one on you.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  Good morning.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He -- Mike has set the bar high.  He was pre-gaming with Pantera  this morning.  Speaking of rage, I don't know where Pantera takes you but  we'll see.  We got three hours to find out.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  (inaudible) in the green room though.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  No, it's very  calm, it's very exciting.  You think old school metal you think this, of  course. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Actually I do.</p><p>BLOCK:  Full of surprises.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  As Washington is as well, full of surprises.  And  coming up this morning to discuss the agenda and everything that's  happening down in D.C. that matters to your money.</p><p>Florida Congressman, Ron DeSantis is here.  The Schork Report, Steven  Schork.  Fox News Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitanom one of our  favorites.  And Former Texas Congressman and Presidential Candidate, Ron  Paul.  You don't want to miss a second of it.  </p><p>But first, President Trump tending back to jobs, the White House is kicking  off what it calls workforce development week focusing on boosting  apprenticeship programs for blue collar workers.  This comes as the White  House continues to grapple with fallout from Former FBI Director, James  Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill last week.  The president once again  weighted into the news tweeting this yesterday, \"I believe that James Comey  leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone thought possible.  Totally  illegal?  Very cowardly!\"</p><p>The South Carolina Senator, Lindsey Graham warns the president's own words  on the Russia probe are getting in the way of his agenda and something  getting done, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  Here's what's so frustrating for  republicans like me, you may be the first president in history to go down  because you can't stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that  if you just were quiet would clear you.  This is frustrating for me to want  to help a man who I think will do big things, no other republican would do  like immigration.  Believe it or not, I think Donald Trump may deliver us  from a broken immigration system, this is not helping.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now is Former New York Congresswoman, now a Member of  the Board of Directors for the Independent Women's Forum, Nan Hayworth.   Congressman, good to see you.  How did it help though with Senator Lindsey  Graham using language like, \"going down\" in terms of the presidency?  These  -- none of these republicans are helping and I point back to just that  panel last week that interrogated James Comey, they gave him the past quite  frankly.</p><p>FMR REP NAN HAYWORTH (R) NEW YORK, BOARD OF DIRECTOR, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S  FORUM:  Well -- and I think the watch for really is discipline on all sides  if we really want to get.  And there is a great agenda that the president  was elected legitimately to pursue including job creation as you were just  mentioning.</p><p>Then he needs to I think apply discipline to his social media habits, he's  capable of doing it, he's a very smart man who knows how to reach out to  the public and on republican side, we have to hang together.  So we're  going to have to all of us learn how to accept the signals among ourselves  and not use language that's vulnerable to use by those on the left who want  to bring the agenda down.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  He's clearly appealing to the base with the tweets but can that  be broader?  I mean it looks like the base gets fragmented at times with  some of the messages that come in out of the tweets?</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Well, yes, because they tend to be unfortunately a bit in  temperate, maybe impulsive.  The president is no question blunt and in some  ways that's to be preferred over certain other forms of communication.</p><p>But, yes, the president -- look, he's great at reaching out.  Look at the  groups he campaigned among when he was running for president, right?  He  went to urban communities, he went to obviously the blue wall, the blue  states, he appealed to labor.  These are folks he can continue to bring in  in a very important way because he's really got an incredible mission that  he's pursuing.  This job's initiative is going to be very powerful.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And let's talk about that Mike because yesterday, President  Trump had one Comey tweet I think all day long but he was tweeting about  the economy.  The performance of the stock market, then number of jobs  created particularly with this apprenticeship program, you have a record  number of job openings in this country, there are six million positions  waiting to be filled.</p><p>And according to stats from the Labor Department, nine out of ten Americans  who complete apprentice training land a job, their average starting salary  is $60,000 a year, it's an underused way to get people back into the  workforce.</p><p>BLOCK:  It's exciting to hear about this and I think we all want to hear  more about this.  The thing with this is, you have an apprenticeship  program, you're helping to increase the American worker's productivity.</p><p>This is what's going to drive growth, this is what will drive wages, this  is what will drive quality of life.  We want to keep hearing about this.   My question for you is, who within Trump circle can get him refocused on  what's going on here?  I want to hear more about this, enough with the  emails.  We keep going back to that.  Enough with Comey, enough with this,  let's focus on growth, let's focus on making America great again.  Who can  help me do that?</p><p>HAYWORTH:  I agree.  Well look, the president has a -- really a group of  gifted people around him.  I mean he's chosen some very smart people, not  all of whom have fallen into line with everything that he said and we know  that as well.</p><p>So I think we all look to Ivanka, we look to -- Mrs. Trump is going to be  taking a presence from the White House and I think she is quite savvy --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And she tweeted a photo from being in the White House.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Yes, exactly.  So I think having Melania there may also be a  moderating influence and --  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  She didn't take his phone from him?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  She probably has more access than anyone else but --  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  And don't you believe that the media in part, it may be their  fault in focusing the message on the tweets and on the emails and not on  jobs or these growth initiatives like healthcare and tax reform.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Heather, there's no question about it.  And he -- the president  creates the bait and take the bait and he really has so much to offer in  such an important agenda.  He has to be aware that the media are not going  to be with him --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All the way.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Don't give them ammunition.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well we did to that point in the press conference.  On Friday,  he said 100 percent I'll sit down with -- I'll talk to Robert Mueller if  you ask me and talk under oath and then he also raised the issue of the  potential existence of tapes?</p><p>And so now what's everybody going to be talking about this, Jeff Sessions  testifying tomorrow, we don't know if it's going to be in public or not.   But, again, that's why you have to avoid talking about all of this and I  fault a lot of the republicans because there's division in the agenda.   There's division in the republican party about how to raise revenue in any  kind of tax reform, there's a lot of division about healthcare because  these non-conservative republicans don't want to give up the Medicaid  funding that they got under ObamaCare.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Dagen, I'm with it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Every reason to oppose the build in the senate that came out of  the house on ObamaCare repeal.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  I lived it in the House of Representatives when I was there.  We  had the great wave in 2010 and we thought, \"Boy, we're going to be able to  move forward swiftly\" and it was very, very difficult.</p><p>And a lot of it is that there are in every congressional district and in  every state, there are certain key concerns among constituencies that the  electives no matter their party have to try to honor.  I do think one thing  that the president's been calling for that I think is a very smart thing  for him to pursue and I would pursue it behind the scenes with Mitch  McConnell is to work hard on the filibuster on culture and legislation  because really truly Chuck Schumer is --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's coming after the administration not just President Trump.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Exactly.  It doesn't matter of how brilliant the plan the  republicans come up and how unified they may be and how ecumenical they'll  be about those concerns.  Chuck Schumer's got to block it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're getting awfully too with Chuck Schumer inviting the  president to testify in front of congress.  Come on man, you think about  your constituents. </p><p>Nan, there's a controversial -- speaking of New York City, a controversial  production of Shakespeare in the Park, the Shakespeare play, Julius Caesar  causing the New York-based public theater some of its sponsorship money.   Both Delta and Bank of America are pulling support after it shows basically  Caesar is portrayed as Donald Trump, it's a Donald Trump look-a-like being  stabbed to death on the senate floor.  And your reaction to this  controversy?</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Well the fascinating thing that, of course, that would be  directive place is, well, of course, that we're pointing out that it's a  very bad thing to assassinate your leader because, of course, Julius Caesar  in the play, the come to a very dreadful and for Rome.</p><p>But what everybody's going to focus on, of course, is the fact that they're  assassinating a figure of Donald Trump and it's incredibly hypocritical for  folks in the entertainment industry to come after (inaudible) </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  So violent.  It's just so, so violent.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  They would never have done that with his predecessor.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, these companies Mitch, they're saying, \"Enough is  enough.\"</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Listen, know amongst your brand --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of like you saw what happened to Kathy Griffin and she  cried crocodile tears and then blamed the Trump family for taking her down,  hasn't been taking personal responsibility for what happened.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  I mean that's just cunning that anybody would take her seriously  after something like that.  And Delta and Bank of America are listening to  the American public which they should.</p><p>BLOCK:  I want to know what the producers of this play were thinking after  what happened to Kathy Griffin are going to do in this.  I don't care what  your political views are, you could dislike Trump.  This is incitement to  violence, why would you do this?  What are you thinking? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well because it's -- well because New York City and it would --  if they're playing to the -- either playing to their base.  They're playing  to their left wing liberal, (inaudible) who happened to love Shakespeare  and what to enjoy seeing something like that.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  That's limited to public.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  I like Shakespeare too.  It's like Shakespeare is more clever  than you are.  Keep it to what it should being throw up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What were you going to say Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No, I was thinking it's really difficult for brands to get  associated with something that becomes so controversial.  Somebody say  there's no such thing as bad publicity but that could in fact be bad  publicity.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Oh Mitch, I think you're right.  And the amazing thing, it's  really sad and troubling that so many figures in the marketplace,  retailers, I mean we saw it with the Ivanka Trump lines at various --  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Nordstrom.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  Right.  Various stores.  I just think it's really sad that  things have become some politicized around the figure of the president in  this way.  I think Delta and Bank of America did the right thing.  I just  think it's a sad commentary on where we are in this political (inaudible) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In those times that we're getting better.  Nan, thank you so  much.  Nan Hayworth, former congresswoman.  Take care.</p><p>HAYWORTH:  It was a pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Uber struggling to put its troubles in the rearview  mirror.  A key executive reportedly resigning amid questions about the  company's workplace culture, the fallout ahead for the ride sharing giant.  </p><p>And will the U.S. add another star to its flag?  Air flag.  Puerto Rico   voting for statehood in a contentious referendum.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick could be taking a leave of absence,  Cheryl Casone has the details on that developing story, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So Dagen, Uber's board of  directors has adopted a series of recommendations about the company's  corporate culture from Former Attorney General Eric Holder.  So it's not  clear whether the board is going to approve a leave of absence for Kalanick  but we should know more possibly there tomorrow.</p><p>And then according to the Wall Street Journal, Uber's Chief Business  Officer, Emil Michael could resign as early as today.  This comes after 20  Uber employees were fired last week for claims of harassment,  discrimination, and bullying.</p><p>Well, Puerto Rico has voted of statehood in a nonbinding referendum.  More  than half a million people voting yesterday to turn the U.S. territory into  the 51st state.  Bu the participation rate was just 23 percent, that leaves  many to question the validity of the vote that was boycotted by several  opposition parties.  Congress has the final word on any changes to Puerto  Rico's political status here.  The referendum coming on the 100th  anniversary of the U.S. granting U.S. citizenship to Puerto Rico.</p><p>Well, summer has arrived in the form of a heat wave over much of the  country.  The heat stretched from Omaha to New York and forecasters say  it's going to, well, stick around for a few days.  Omaha fell 94 degrees  yesterday, Chicago's 88, New York expecting temperatures in the 90s again  today and tomorrow the cool off here in the New York area on Wednesday.</p><p>And then finally this, the Stanley Cup trophy is staying in Pittsburgh.   The Penguins won their second straight title beating the Predators at six  games.  Sidney Crosby the MVP for the second straight year.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIDNEY CROSBY, PENGUINS MVP:  We settled to try to go back-to-back, we knew  it was going to be difficult but you know I think that's probably where the  most joy comes out of it, it's just knowing how difficult it is now to go  back-to-back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  All right.  The Penguins become the first team in 19 years Dagen,  to win back-to-back titles.  And I did see something about NASCAR over the  weekend but I'll leave it there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they were racing out in Pocono.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, my sister was like all jazzed about it.  Anyway, those are  your headlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll get to that.  We want to go back to Uber really quickly.   Michael, what the heck going on at this company?  It -- like what happened  to Travis Kalanick, does that even matter at this point because he's been a  lightning rod over and over again including him berating one of the Uber  drivers on camera?</p><p>BLOCK:  It matters because we're finding this great phenomena where  supposedly liberal accepting Silicon Valley is people blame Wall Street on  one time.  </p><p>But it's become this massive sexual harassment and political incorrectness  and all sorts of things and it make it harder for Uber to A, have a good  public image, it's already tarnished and to attract the right talent.  Now,  the issue here is that you're going to have a lot like strong investors,  other Silicon Valley type of venture capital firms but also the entire  financial investing spectrum is involved in these companies now.  Whether  you think your household name, mutual funds, hedge funds, endowments,  sovereign wealth funds are all involved in this Uber and they're not going  to stand for this.  I don't think he's going to survive this.  I think  another strong leader will emerge out of this.  The company will be fine,  we'll see what it's worth though.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And part of the crisis at Uber, it's been a number of things and  a general feeling and understanding what the culture is like at Uber in  Silicon Valley.  There was also the issue, there was another Uber executive  who has since left who was accused of improperly obtaining a rape victim in  India, her medical records, her confidential medical records.  But, again,  it's just individuals who work there clearly over -- stepping over lines.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The other company that is a disruptor and they are being  disrupted, what's interesting is they're not the only game in town, they  have primary competitors and actually local cities, taxable commissions are  becoming competitive, so that's part of the problem is disruption.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And behavior within the company among the management.   Coming up, will we see another interest rate hike tomorrow?  What to expect  from this week's federal reserve meeting and the markets.</p><p>And Wonder Woman buries The Mummy at the box office, it's not all bad news  for the Tom Cruise blockbuster, Tom Cruise is in it?  Why Universal might  not send the horror franchise back to the crypt just yet.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stocks under pressure this morning, 33 point loss on the DOW  Futures but, again, it's text stocks, the worst performer in premarket.   Michael, the second day -- straight day of weakness in that sector and you  got those same stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, I mean you throw  in Microsoft and Apple, they all got taken to the woodshed, they were down  three to roughly four percent each and every one on them on Friday.</p><p>BLOCK:  This is after (inaudible).  Now what I'll --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  well explain it then, she'll worry about it.</p><p>BLOCK:  Sure.  I'll explain it here and I'll go by over the weekend Jack  Bogle from Vanguard who's very accomplished, the father of passive  investing said, \"I still like the U.S. stock market because everyone else  is saying get out of it, I'm going to go against the crowd.\"</p><p>Mr. Bogle, you are the crowd, everyone is crowded paying stocks.  No, with  all due respect, he is the crowd.  And everyone's crowed for the same  stocks, it's true of the major indices, it's true of these text stocks.   It's not a matter of valuation.  Barons this weekend gave you the bull case  for LAM research which is semiconductor equipment stock and I'll tell you  the valuation, how it's going a lot higher, that stock was down  substantially on Friday because everyone owns it, I get the bull pieces.   Everyone else gets the bull pieces too, that's the problem with stocks like  this. </p><p>And when everyone crowds into the same thing and there's any perturbation  in the system, things are going to go down.  These stocks are still viable,  people want to own growth but they need a little break here so we're seeing  day two of that, let's see how much longer it goes, eventually you want to  own these stocks again.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  And don't you think it took someone to make the first move  which happen to be Goldman in this case and the analyst said, \"Let's get  out of these names.  These names maybe oversold, overheated, the large cap  growth names, let's move into other sectors such as financials and energy\"  as we saw Friday that were undervalued.  Is that strong (inaudible) back  and more people, investors are going to follow a suit now and get off the  trade --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Assuming that the actual investors with money to put to work  listen to analyst saying more but --  </p><p>BLOCK:  Well it's a good point.  Goldman's making a call, frankly I was  making a call.  But I'm not Goldman, I'm Moreno but I'll take (inaudible)  folks who listen and say, \"Hey -- I'm like, hey look, these stocks are  crowded.  Do you want to put a rotation game, you need to get into these  stocks Friday when it's exactly right.\"</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Back to rotation.</p><p>BLOCK:  Broken clocks are right twice a day.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Twice a day.</p><p>BLOCK:  So there you go.  So if Goldman said about me say about anyone  else.  But the point is, there should be some rotation here, I could be  bullish in U.S. stocks, one of the most bullish things is this rotation.  </p><p>As money comes out of tech, it goes back in the financials and the energy,  we had this rotation, nothing gets too over bought, tech did now the air's  coming out, we just keeping rolling along, keep your feet moving.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about -- real quick, what about the Fed?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  It's -- then the question is, if the Fed's going to  continue to raise rates throughout the air, good for financials, if they  don't, maybe not good for financials.</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  And if you want to address that, one thing I'll say is,  again, it all comes down to set -- positioning.  Financials were left for  dead, you had the big banks saying a key to trading was going to be soft,  we see the yield curve get flatter and flatter, they can't make the  margins, everyone's getting on financials.</p><p>I said, \"Well, here's your opportunity because sooner or later we're going  to see some little tick up in the yield curve when we get this slightest  kind of growth, I don't think growth is dead, I think it's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well and the hint of growth also hopefully would improve their  loan making.</p><p>BLOCK:  That include loan book, trading activity would go up, a lot of  different underwriting activity, a lot of different things.  So for me,  it's a matter of saying what was -- the whole thing baseball play, we will  (inaudible) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you like stocks does not --  </p><p>BLOCK:  (inaudible) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you say you like stocks but not tech, that's the question.</p><p>BLOCK:  No, I'm going to like tech eventually but right now I think we're - -  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But right now.</p><p>BLOCK:  We're day two into selloff, I say we let go eventually to bigger  opportunity but we'd pound the table and say. \"Now, it's time to get back  in and reposition.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Okay.  Coming up, new collection swirling this morning over  whether President Trump recorded his conversations with Former FBI  Director, James Comey.  The debate over the tapes, next.</p><p>And a boozy brain freeze, why adults are asking for refill to this ice  cream.  I've tried it --  </p><p>BLOCK:  Where?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here Mike, and it's delicious.  We'll give you the scoop.</p><p>BLOCK:  6:00 in the morning?  Woo-hoo.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  That's too early for ice cream.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 12th.  Your top stories  at 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>The chaos over Comey continues.  President Trump will reveal that  conversations between him and the former FBI chief were recorded.   Republicans have urged the commander-in-chief to make the reveal as soon as  possible.  The latest, as former FBI Director Comey, may be called to  testify on Capitol Hill, yet again.</p><p>Could be a rough week for Apple.  The company's stock downgraded for the  second time in a week over concerns surrounding the hype around its  upcoming iPhone 8.  Why the enthusiasm might be a bit too much.</p><p>Futures are showing weakness in this morning.  We have losses across the  board, which point out the Dow and the Russell 2000 that gave small cap  stocks closed on Friday at record highs.  The real weakness was in the  NASDAQ, which suffered a pretty stunning selloff.</p><p>After hitting a record high early in trading and then you have losses  across the board in Europe, the biggest loser there, CAC Quarante in  France.  In Asia overnight, the story was red across the board.  Japan,  Hong Kong, Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea all lower.</p><p>Gamers rejoice.  There's a new system in town.

We've got the booze-infused treat that's  helping you cool down this summer.</p><p>Our top story this half hour.  New questions surrounding President Trump's  claim that he recorded his conversations with former FBI Director James  Comey.  The President's legal team says, \"He is planning to reveal whether  or not the tapes actually exist this week.\"  Meantime, Republicans are  urging the President to clear the air on the matter as soon as possible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), MAINE:  This is an issue that the President should  have cleared up in his press conference.  He should give a straight yes or  no to the answer -- to the question of whether or not the tapes exist.  I  don't think a subpoena should be necessary, and I don't understand why the  President just doesn't clear this matter up once and for all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us this morning is former Deputy Assistant Director for  the FBI's Counterterrorism, Counterterror Division, Terry Turchie.  Terry,  your thoughts on this matter and the allegation that there are tapes out  there.</p><p>TERRY TURCHIE, FORMER FBI'S COUNTERTERRORISM DIVISION DEPUTY ASSISTANT:   Well, I guess, Dagen, that if there are tapes out there, it'd be best to  have them and see what's on them.  But, I think, we already know what's on  them, if they exist.  And we know what Director Comey said.  And so, we  pretty much have already all made up our own minds as to whether anything  on there constitutes some sort of crime.</p><p>I'm actually much more concerned, and quite frankly, don't understand why  we're not talking a lot more about that New York Times article in February  of -- February 14th of this year.  That article, according to Mr. Comey, in  his own words, in the main, wasn't true.  And I thought, all of this was --  started because of Russian collusion and the whole idea that perhaps  President Trump was colluding with the Russians.  And I think, we need to  know a lot more about that article.</p><p>We need to know about those three or four sources inside government  somewhere and their motives, and if we want to answer the question about  Russian collusion, that's where we go to get that answer, not those tapes.   And I don't understand why we're not working and worrying about that right  now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Terry, it's Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Terry.  If there is --  let's say there are no tapes, does this issue ever go away?  I mean,  there's always going to be another theory after another theory.  Does the  issue go away?</p><p>TURCHIE: Well, that's really a great question and here's why.  I don't  think the issues are ever going to go away.  They're going to come up with  one issue after another, if what I feel is correct, and I actually feel  President Trump is the one who is the victim of a Russian active measures  campaign.  Now, it could very well be that this is just some, sort of,  political thing involving the Democratic Party, maybe.</p><p>But, I think, if there's Russian collusion and there's Russian intelligence  behind this, all of this looks much more when you look at the evidence,  like, if it points in that direction.  And if he looks like the victim of a  campaign intended to destabilize our country and basically stop his  presidency, which goes to the answer to your question, these issues aren't  going to go away if that's the case.  They're going to keep coming up with  one and then another.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What would be the reason to hold these tapes back, if there are  tapes?</p><p>TURCHIE:  Well, there wouldn't be any reason.  If there are tapes, let them  go.  I mean, I think, we all wonder if there are any or it was just  something he said in the moment.  But if there are tapes, let them go.  It  benefits him to let them go and we can all make up our own mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Well, we wouldn't be -- Terry, before we move on, we  wouldn't be talking about this tapes -- these tapes if President Trump  hadn't brought them up again on Friday.</p><p>TURCHIE:  Well, he brings things up all the time.  Everybody's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it hurts him.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it hurts him.  It doesn't help.</p><p>TURCHIE:  It sure does.  It doesn't.  And I think, that this is, kind of,  what we should expect though if we're going to put a non-politician type of  person, who pretty much, just wings it when he goes out and talks.  And I'm  certainly willing to see that happen.  I mean, that's what we get when we  choose somebody that's not a -- that hasn't been around Washington, D.C.</p><p>This is really the problem we have in the first place with the fact that  Director Comey, if nobody else was going to do it, should've talked to  President Trump about the way you deal with the FBI, because no president  deals with the FBI the way he kind of did, and I don't think he'd ever had  any discussions with anyone about that.  You've got to be very careful if  you're going to sit there and talk to the FBI director about anything.</p><p>And this is not new.  Remember that it is an open secret in Washington,  D.C., that for eight years, former FBI Director Louis Freeh and President  Bill Clinton had an open warfare going.  They did not talk, they didn't get  along, and it was all because President Clinton felt slid at something that  the director did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>TURCHIE:  So, this is -- this is common.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Terry, good to see you.  Thank you so much for being here.   Terry Turchie.</p><p>TURCHIE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we've got breaking news to bring you.  You've been watching  it.  These banners at the bottom of your screen, that Jeff Immelt is out at  General Electric.  The company just announcing that Immelt will be replaced  by John Flannery as Chairman and CEO.  Flannery is current -- the current  President and CEO of G.E. Healthcare.</p><p>Mike Block, to you first, what do you make of this?  Again, it speaks to  what G.E. is today as a corporation.  And by the way, Immelt will stay on  as the chairman through December of this year.</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  Right.  And you  know, this has been talked about for a while.  We've had some activists  involved in the stock.  Largely, this company has been left for dead by  investors.  They're in a situation where they'd cut off some of their  businesses that were profitable and generated cash flow over the years,  including the financial part of the business.  They've been pairing things  off.</p><p>Meanwhile, healthcare, which is Flannery's domain, has been chugging along.   The margins were topping out there.  Margins and lighting, which, you know,  I think, people think of G.E., they think of lighting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BLOCK:  That's cut off.  That business is probably for sale.  Meanwhile,  they expanded heavily into oil and gas.  They're merging operations with  Baker Hughes, right around the time where margins are getting squeezed  there.  There's a lot of doubt about their dividend, there's a lot of doubt  about their free cash flow going negative.  People are really down on the  stock.</p><p>The question is, will investors view this as a positive step bringing in  Flannery who is someone, I think, is a fresh look, someone who's done a  good job of running health care, in most investor's opinion, will be good.   I think, it's a positive step.  This company still has a lot to get  through.  I think, someone on another network the other day said, you know,  \"G.E. is the market.  Look to G.E.,\" which I thought was, kind of, a --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Who says that anymore?</p><p>BLOCK:  Someone who shouldn't have said that because it was, kind of, a  silly thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, that's an old -- that's an old rusty saw somebody broke  that.  That's a chainsaw with the chain that's all busted.</p><p>BLOCK:  It was, kind of, like -- it was, kind of, like, a person who shall  remain nameless.  You know, in 1999 called they want their stock market  theory back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>BLOCK:  So anyway, that's why they're all here.  So, in any event, you  know, when it comes down to -- because this company doesn't have the  relevance it once did, but it's obviously, a bellwether stock still.  We're  going to see if this can turn around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the last year, the stock is lower.  This year, the stock  down, and you can look at the pre-market reaction to the fact that Jeff  Immelt is out.  I think, it was up about two and a half percent in pre- market.  That does say something about the need for leadership change.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Interesting story of transformation, though, in that company  because what you -- what most people think about it -- we were joking  before, what most people think about them doing, they're in a completely  different business and they fancy themselves a bit of a technology  innovator.  So, maybe the change is all part of the transformation.</p><p>BLOCK:  The end game maybe, but we are looking at G.E. Healthcare as one  entity, G.E. Oil and Gas is another.  And then, you know, after that,  what's really left, the industrial businesses, you know, heavy ones there,  but lighting is not left.  Maybe it becomes three or even four companies at  the end of this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So perhaps, you've diversified yourself --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, are you saying that they would just break the company up?</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  It would be easier for investors to understand and allow  focus business models that's, sort of, coming down to -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.  Consolidate.</p><p>BLOCK:  They have a huge wall of debt and cash flows used to get underneath  then.  So Flannery, you know, you're up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And two weeks ago, Jeff Immelt came out.  He stated  the $2 earnings per share got into 2018 would be the high end of  expectations actually.  And did he -- you know, was that -- should he not  have said that, in terms of guidance is coming down, we're really going to  have to stretch ourselves to meet this $2 earnings targets.</p><p>BLOCK:  Well, he -- you know, in his defense, if you will, he had to  because he was being pressured to talk about it.  And, you know, the fact  of the matter is, you know, with debt servicing they have to do and the  margins shrinking in oil and gas for now, and I think, that could come  back, that's the issue with this company.  So, very challenging, and people  are saying, \"You know what, we're not, you know -- it's time for Jeff to  leave and I think, that finally, the board and everything else got to him,  and you know -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great analysis, Michael.  We'll have more on this as the morning  wears on.  Coming up, the first family reunited under one roof.  Melania  Trump and Barron say goodbye to the Big Apple and move into the White  House.  Plus, Wonder Woman lasso's another win, while The Mummy unravels a  bit.  We break down the weekend box office.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  Futures pointing to a lower open.  29- point loss on the Dow Futures.  Watching the NASDAQ, of course, major  selloff to report in the NASDAQ.  On Friday, people are looking at that,  worrying about that potentially.</p><p>And we'll point out that Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric is  stepping down and he is being replaced under Immelt's tenure at G.E. from  September of 2001, that stocks (INAUDIBLE) down 28 percent.  If you  invested in the Dow or the S&amp;P 500, you'd be up triple digits.  </p><p>And we're looking at a few more stocks on the move this morning.  Microsoft  unveiling its latest video game console, the Xbox One X.  The company says,  \"It's the smallest and most powerful Xbox ever made.\"  It's expected to  launch November 7th for 500 bucks.  Microsoft shares are down this morning  as a big selloff in those shares yesterday along with Apple.  And Apple has  been downgraded to neutral from buy for the second time in a week.</p><p>Analysts at Mizuho expect that sales of the iPhone 8 will fall short of  attracting new customers.  Instead, sales will be driven largely by current  users upgrading to new phones.  And Apple's shares, again, lower in pre- market trading.  An insider attack killing U.S. Army Rangers in  Afghanistan.  Cheryl Casone has the details on this.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  An Afghan soldier, Dagen,  opened fire on a group of U.S. Army Rangers, killing three of them and  wounding one.  This happened in Eastern Afghanistan.  The gunman was killed  in return fire.  The Taliban claiming responsibility for the attack.  More  than 8,000 U.S. troops are currently stationed in Afghanistan, we should  add.  The Trump Administration considering sending up to 5,000 additional  troops to that country.</p><p>Well, Montana Congressman-Elect Greg Gianforte has agreed to plead guilty  to misdemeanor assault today.  He is accused of body-slamming a reporter.   Gianforte has apologized to the journalist, Ben Jacobs, he also has pledged  to donate $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization  that promotes press freedom.  The incident happened in Gianforte's campaign  headquarters last month.</p><p>Well, the White House is now a full house, now that First Lady Melania and  son Barron have joined President Trump in the executive mansion at 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue.  Their official move to Washington coming nearly five  months after the president was inaugurated.  Melania and Barron have been  living at Trump Tower here in New York until Barron finished the school  year.  Barron is to attend a private school in Maryland this fall.  And  then, Wonder Woman, she beat the competition, new competition at the  weekend box office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREVOR:  Diana!</p><p>HIPPOLYTA:  Be careful of mankind, Diana.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The film helmed by a female director, female star, brought in $57  million in its second weekend, totally bearing the competition, which by  the way, with Tom Cruise's \"The Mummy,\" starring Tom Cruise, wrapped up a  much lower than expected 32 million in the debut weekend.  It came in  second place.</p><p>Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, based on the children's book,  came in 3rd, 12 million there, Pirates of the Caribbean finishing 4th, 10  million, and then Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the summer's we  should say highest-grossing film, thus far, did slip to 5th place with $6  million.  Dagen, once again, the ladies killing it at the box office over  the weekend.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Over the weekend, speaking of strong women,  I finished binge-watching the new season of House of Cards.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Don't say anything.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I'm just going to say strong women, Robin Wright and then  Patricia Clarkson is in it, who's amazing.  And I started watching the old  FX show, Damages with Glenn Close and Rose Byrne, so I highly recommend  that as well, also on Netflix.  Because I'm a loser, that's what I do,  watch TV.</p><p>Coming up.  Turning is -- up a new twist on a dessert classic.  More adults  giving boozy ice cream a shot.  We have the scoop, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this news breaking in the last 20 minutes or so, Jeff Immelt  is out at General Electric.  The company just announcing that Immelt will  be replaced by John Flannery, as Chairman and CEO, Flannery is currently  the President and CEO of G.E. Health Care, but this is - if you ask why,  and by the way, as Mike Block pointed out just a short while ago that this  move by a mini company watchers and investors is not surprising and was  expected by some, but did you ask why broadly speaking because since Jeff  Immelt took over as the CEO of General Electric, this was in September of  2001, that stock is down 28 percent.  What has the Dow and S&amp;P done?   They're up triple digits.  </p><p>Those broad market gauges, you just invested in an index fund, you would  have more than doubled your money.  If you put your money on Jeff Immelt  running G.E., you would have lost money.  That's point-blank, Mike, what  we're talking about.  Now, General Electric during Immelt's 10-year had  shed some low-margin businesses like the -- they got out of the lending  business out of the financial business, got out of the appliance business  but it's not enough to satisfy investors.</p><p>BLOCK:  You know, really, Heather made a point earlier where they've been  promising these earnings per shared targets, and they just couldn't make  them anymore.  They're crippled under a lot of debt, they have all these  legacy businesses, they have some contractual revenues in a lot of their  businesses that are just stifling their margin growth, you know, they  locked in - they aggressively locked into some deals across their business  lines.  I'm saying industrials, oil, and gas, that are coming back and  biting them.  So .</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Baker Hughes deal?</p><p>BLOCK:  Yes.  Right.  Possibly at the wrong time.  I think long-term,  that's going to be a great deal when you have this - when you're merging -  you know, when X number of companies goes to X-1, I think, it's a good  thing, you know, these are large oil service companies so they can end up  doing well, but it's going to take time, you need to own us right here; you  do the math on the evaluation of this company right now and really, I can't  find anyone that likes it.  Ironically, the fact that no one likes it,  maybe the best thing coming for it right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mike, you were saying before during the break that  there's activist shareholders in - how much of this do you think is in  response to pressure from activists?</p><p>BLOCK:  It's been sort of a time and pressure thing that it's really                                                                                                                                               (INAUDIBLE) you know, really well-acclaimed, brilliant activist investors  had been in there for a while, and they've been trying to work with the  company, and these guys tried to work with the company as whether it's  Nelson Peltz, Ed Gardner, the other folks there, and they've done -- you  know, they've done a great job with a lot of companies.  This is really a - - what G.E. in stables of a company here.  So, again, I predict this is  going to be four -- you know, three or four companies in the future, health  care, the industrial businesses, oil and gas and we're going to see where  it goes from there but this is going to be a - this is the long game, it's  not a trade.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have Robert Wolf on the phone, he is a Fox News Contributor,  he's a frequent guest on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  He's the CEO of 32 Advisors,  also ran UBS back in the day.  Robert, what do you make of this?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND 32 ADVISOR CEO (through telephone):   Well, listen, as you know, I've worked with Jeff for over a decade and  spent four or five years with him on President Obama's advisory council.   So, I mean, listen, just a thought leader, he had to go through an  incredible though decade of transforming G.E. away from G.E capital and  back as your prior guests - I'm sorry, I didn't know his name, I just tuned  in.  But as this prior guest mentioned into really the three core  businesses, industrial, health care and power.  I think that during that  transformation, he took the company from, you know, where they were losing  billions of dollars to now an incredibly well-capitalized company and I  think - you know, like all CEOs that sometimes it's time to pass the torch  after you take the company to these transformations, and based on what I  read about Flannery, it seems like he's absolutely the right guy.  </p><p>And so I think it seems like it's going to be a very smooth transition.   With respect to Nelson Peltz and (INAUDIBLE) and Ed Gardner, and them,  listen, they work hard to make sure that for their - for their investors  that they're forcing decisions at these type of large companies, whether  they end up going to a split, who knows, obviously it didn't work with  Pepsi, and Pepsi is flourishing without splitting but, you know, they did  force the hand at (INAUDIBLE) so, you know, I think time will tell whether  this company will stay as one now that G.E. Capital has been (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Robert, that was some incredible analysis that you gave us in  about a minute, and we thank you for that.  We just wish you were here in  person, Robert Wolf.</p><p>WOLF:  Me, too, thank you, Dagen.  Appreciate it.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  We will see you soon.  We'll be right back,  everybody.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 12th.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Monday June 12th.  Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>In the last half hour this news breaking, Jeff Immelt out at General  Electric.  The company just announcing that Immelt will be replaced by John  Flannery as chairman and CEO.  Flannery is the current and president of GE  Health Care.</p><p>You can take a look at the market reaction.  Jeff Immelt hitting the bricks  and the stock rocketing higher, up more than 3.5 percent.</p><p>And getting America back to work, President Trump expected to unveil a new  jobs push in Wisconsin tomorrow.  The announcement comes amid a new agenda  push for the White House as the administration looks to shake off the  Russia election controversy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RONNA ROMNEY MCDANIEL, RNC CHAIRMAN:  I'm calling for an end to the  investigations about President Trump's campaign colluding on -- with the  Russians.  This needs to end.  Nobody has come forward with any evidence  that there's been collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians and  it keeps persisting.  So it's time to put an end to this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest on the renewed agenda push ahead.</p><p>Futures are showing losses across the board -- 31-point loss on the Dow  futures.  Another selloff at least it looks like that's going to happen on  technology stocks with the Nasdaq 100 futures down two-thirds of 1 percent.   Those winners this year, those incredible winners like Facebook and Amazon  and Netflix and the Google parent company -- they tumbled on Friday.</p><p>In Europe stocks also lower across the board in England, France and Germany  there.  About a 1 percent loss in France.</p><p>In Asia overnight, same story, nothing but red across the board with the  biggest loser being the Hang Seng down at one-and-a-quarter percent.</p><p>And check your cupboard, Chef Boyardee issuing a massive recall over  mislabeling -- what you need to know before you crack open that can.</p><p>California gold rush -- one lucky winner set to take home the tenth largest  lottery price in U.S. history -- the massive $447 million win ahead.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning.  Financial analyst  Heather Zumarraga, Rhino Trading Partners chief strategist Michael Block,  and PWC partner Mitch Roschelle.  </p><p>Mitch -- Jeff Immelt out.  Do you agree with what Robert Wolf was saying  that -- Robert was complimentary of Immelt's tenure even though the stock  was down 28 percent since Immelt took over?  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  I think if you compare it to the Dow and  other index, to your point earlier, it doesn't look great but if you think  about all of the businesses that were in during that period of time and  what happened to those businesses -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The financial business.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, the financial prices taking place, you had the industrial  complex sort of changing so he had to navigate a lot of major disruption in  traditional businesses.  </p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  He did.  And in his defense he may  have inherited as you're saying a lot of this that there's too many  businesses across the board.  Maybe we need to consolidate and selloff more  of these divisions to narrow our focus.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  GE if you look backwards it almost looked like a private equity  company with all of these different portfolio companies and the private  equity model it's private, you can do a lot of different things when you're  a public company.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's the old thought is that GE is a gauge of the U.S.  economy.  And to my point, well, the S&amp;P 50 a gauge of the U.S. economy is  up, what, 120 percent in the time that Jeff Immelt was running GE.  And GE  stock is down.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS:  At a different part of business  cycle perhaps it was the bellwether for the U.S.  Not anymore.  Again, you  know, to Jeff Immelt's credit, he did guide them through the crisis.   People thought that stock was going to zero.  It didn't quite go to zero.   Here it is.  It didn't outperform. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And also it got a lot of capital infusions during the financial  crisis.  </p><p>BLOCK:  It did.  As with other financials.  So that's, you know, that's  that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But during the bull market GE shares actually until the market  bottom fell out, the marker did beat the S&amp;P and the Dow.  So when times  were good they were better for GE but man, it got tough for the company.</p><p>And coming up this morning: the Schork Report's Stephen Schork on all  things oil and gas, Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano, and GolfTEC CEO Joe Assell, and former Texas congressman and  presidential candidate Ron Paul.  You don't want to miss any of those fine  gentlemen.</p><p>And to our top story this hour -- another top story, President Trump  holding his first meeting with a full cabinet today.  This as the GOP  pushes both health care and tax reform.  House Whip Steve Scalise, majority  whip saying both are a priority.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STEVE SCALISE (R), LOUISIANA:  Cutting taxes is going to inject so  much momentum into this economy, create a lot of jobs.  We also have the  health care bill moving through the Senate and I know they're trying to get  the text finalized so they can ultimately get to a vote by July 4th.  And I  think both are important to do and to do them as soon as we can.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Florida Congressman and House Freedom Caucus  member Ron DeSantis.  Congressman -- are you going to work through the  recess to get this done?  </p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  I think we have to.  You hear in  Washington, oh, there's all these things on the agenda, the appropriations  in addition to which you mentioned and we just have so few legislative  days.  Well, there's nothing written in stone that you have to take five  weeks in August and early September.  So my view would be we have to make  the most of our opportunities now and to kind of cut out and come back  without getting our work done I think would be a mistake.</p><p>Now, normally I would say it's better for the country when Congress isn't  in session because then they can't do damage.  But in this case we have a  number of things lined up and I think that the American people are not  going to say, they just ran out of time, they tried.  So yes, we have to  get it done I think whatever it takes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, it's Mitch Roschelle.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Congressman -- with a finite number of days left and they have  to start prioritizing what could get done this year and what can't, in the  sort of rock, paper, scissors game here -- is taxes going to be more  important than health care.  And then you also passed the bill last week  into the repealing and replacing Dodd-Frank.  Which of those becomes the  priority?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, I think that -- I don't know that I think of it that way  just because procedurally the healthcare is part of the FY 17 budget  reconciliation.  You've got to do that in order to go on to the next budget  which will then have the instructions to write the tax reform.</p><p>So I think you've got to do both of those.  I think you can do both of  those.  You know, the Dodd-Frank piece I think would be very good for the  economy, moving away from too big to fail and really lifting the burden off  a lot of our small and medium-sized financial institutions who have just  gotten clubbed by Dodd-Frank.</p><p>I think the issue is what in that bill would be able to get 60 votes in the  Senate.  And so it's not clear to me that there's a path for all of it,  maybe some of it.  But clearly I think that that would be a very good thing  if we're able to get that done  as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Heather Zumarraga -- Congressman, has a question for you.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  If we are lifting some of the financial regulations off of the  financial institutions or the big banks and Dodd-Frank, what -- do you  think that would be a positive for financials in freeing up more capital  for them in the long run?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Oh, yes, I think even in the short run if you look at the number  of new banks that have come into existence since Dodd-Frank I mean it's  infinitesimal.</p><p>And the biggest banks, by the way, have gotten bigger since Dodd-Frank.   They don't necessarily like a lot of the regulatory burdens but they have  the ability to deal with it.  It's really the smaller, medium-sized  institutions that get hurt.  I think hurts competition in that industry.   And yes, I do think that you'd have the ability.  </p><p>You know, when lending particularly for the small businesses that are kind  of the life blood of all of our communities, I think that has really been  one of the worst things about Dodd-Frank.  Some of the big deals still get  done but man, we want a financial system where those -- that money is  available for people.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- much is made about President Trump's problems --  some issues self-created, all of the drama coming out of the White House;  Senate leader Mitch McConnell wanting the President to provide less drama,  if you will.  But I point to the drama within your own party, where you  have senators and people in the House who can't agree on how are you going  to pay for tax reform?  Are you going to do tax reform?  Are you going to  do tax cuts?</p><p>In the Senate you see the division as they try to move ahead on the health  care bill that you passed miraculously but they don't -- some senators in  the Republican Party, they don't want to give up the Medicaid handouts.   They are making issues about the opioid crisis and coverage for rehab, if  you will.</p><p>Is part -- is a bigger problem in essence the division within the party and  not what happens out of the White House?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, I think that having debate within the party, I think  that's a healthy thing.  That's how you arrive at I think good outcomes.  I  mean the taxes is a good example.  A lot of us are very concerned about  having a border adjustment tax in there.  We think it's bad economics.  We  think that it will potentially stymie doing tax reform at all.  There's  other members that have a different view of that.  And I think that that's  healthy to have those debates.</p><p>I think the problem that I think Republicans in Congress have had is when  there's this big gap between their campaign rhetoric and then their actions  in Washington and we were very strong for years and years running against  Obamacare.  Wow we are in a position where the House obviously passed a  bill that Senate is doing some negotiations to just not get that done and  walk away.  I mean that would be a huge mistake.</p><p>So I think it's just understanding the promises you've made, not letting  the swamp and the environment in the swamp distort that and just keep the  rudder set on true north and we'll be ok.  To the extent we don't do that,  I think that's when you can run into some problems.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- you all might as well be running around on fan  boats, though.  I mean it looks like -- I mean from the outside looking in,  it looks like the same morass it was last October.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, I think, though -- I mean part of it is the narrative that  gets spun in Washington.  And I think one of the fall-outs from the Comey  stuff is a lot of this narrative that the media has been spinning about the  President has been a false narrative.</p><p>Comey was telling him privately behind the scenes you're not under  investigation, you're not under investigation.  Yet publicly Comey was  being coy about it.  He was effectively inviting a lot of irresponsible  speculation.  I think that was very damaging to the President, to our  agenda because it sucked a lot of the oxygen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I agree.</p><p>DESANTIS:  And I just think it's highly irresponsible of Comey.</p><p>But the thing is I think we are kind of beyond that now for that hearing.   I mean we know that the President is not under investigation.  We know that  there's not any evidence from the Russia stuff.  And so I think if these  committees can kind of bring this to a conclusion then I think they're be  more interest in some of the policy agenda.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly, I said that last week during the hearings  and after the hearings.  I felt like the Republican senators sitting on  that panel fed into the Comey narrative that they didn't push him hard  enough and questioned him hard enough.</p><p>I know time was of the essence, the hearing quite frankly, they needed a  lot more time to bear down on James Comey but you did not hear that -- you  wouldn't expect to hear it from the Democrats but you didn't hear it from  the Republicans.  Just pressing him on why didn't you resign, why didn't  you say something to President Trump, why didn't you report this to anybody  at the Justice Department if he felt compromised by Trump's comments about  Michael Flynn.  All of that, I blame the Republicans in part.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, it's true.  I mean you noticed he said he felt queasy when  Attorney General Lynch told him to refer to it as a matter yet, he  basically went ahead and did it and didn't do anything to raise a red flag.   He exonerated Hillary himself because he felt Lynch was conflicted but  never offer to resign.</p><p>So I think kind of one of the things that's coming through his testimony is  he tends to do what's best for him and his image.</p><p>And I think his testimony has left a lot of questions and if he comes back  to Congress and maybe the Senate or House Judiciary Committees, you know, I  think that there's going to be a lot of things he's going to have to answer  for.  And so the extent he was going to be this star witness, I'm just not  sure that that was case at all.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Even Senator Dianne Feinstein, long-time Democrat,  raising the issue of a senate panel looking into Loretta Lynch and what she  told James Comey about the Hillary Clinton investigation.</p><p>Congressman DeSantis -- it was good to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We will see you soon.  </p><p>Coming up, a shake-up at the top of General Electric, details on the new  chairman and CEO who replaces Jeff Immelt.</p><p>And parents check the pantry.  Chef Boyardee is recalling thousands of cans  of a childhood classic.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news this morning -- a change at the top of General  Electric.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has more details -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right -- Dagen.</p><p>GE CEO Jeff Immelt is retiring ending a 16-year run as the leader of the  industrial conglomerate.  He's going to be replaced by John Flannery in  August, who is currently the President and CEO of GE Health Care.  The move  was expected by some people who follow GE.  General Electric says that  Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the  year.  Flannery is going to take on the title of chairman on January 1st.</p><p>Now Immelt has taken steps to reshape GE after the financial crisis but the  company has struggled to boost profits.  GE shares are rallying though on  the premarket on the news, up 3.61 percent as you can see on your screen.   GE, a stock to watch today.</p><p>We are also watching this for you.  More than 700,000 pounds of Chef  Boyardee products are s being recalled.  The canned pasta and other  products are being recalled because of mislabeling.  The spaghetti meatball  products were determined also to contain milk but that's not listed on  label.  That's the big problem.  All these products have establishment  number, est.794 m inside the USCA inspection marks, so you have to kind of  look for it.  Chef Boyardee products are made by Conagra Brands, we should  say.</p><p>Well, Warren Buffett charity lunch selling for $2.68 million this year.   And anonymous fan of Buffett agreed to pay the amount at a five-day eBay  auction which drew 41 bids.  The winner and up to seven friends going to  dine with Buffett at the Smith and Wollensky Steakhouse in Manhattan.  The  money also, we should going to charity, the San Francisco charity Glide has  always been the benefactor of Mr. Buffett's Warren lunch.</p><p>And some lucky winner out there is holding the ticket to $447 million.  The  Powerball ticket matching all six numbers was sold in southern California  on Saturday.  Whoever owns it is going to claim the tenth largest lottery  prize in U.S. history.  The California lottery said in a statement that the  winning ticket was sold at Marietta Liquor and Deli in a very small city of  Menifee, California.  It can be redeemed starting today.  The winner has a  year and we shall see if they come forward hopefully soon.</p><p>And those are your headlines.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up the diplomatic crisis in Qatar roiling the oil markets -- we're  looking at the long term implications.</p><p>And the CEO of GolfTEC swinging by -- how the golf giant is refreshing its  brand for a new generation.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The cost of crude oil and why you care about it, because again,  that is what you put into your tank.  Oil up 1.5 percent right now -- up  about 69, 70 cents a barrel but still well below that $50 a barrel mark.   It's been a rough few weeks for the cost of crude falling nearly 10 percent  over the last three weeks.</p><p>Joining us now Schork Report founder Stephen Schork.  Stephen -- do you  expect this weakness to continue?  </p><p>STEPHEN SCHORK, SCHORK REPORT:  Well, right now, Dagen -- if we are going  to see any sort of rebound in price it has to happen now.  From a technical  standpoint we are in a critical range, that is, oil between the price of  $45 and $47 a barrel.</p><p>I do expect it to hold.  Demand has never been stronger for crude oil in  this country.  It is now the middle of June.  We are ramping up going into  the peak summer driving demand season so crude oil at its highest with  regard to demand.  The gasoline demand about to surge.</p><p>And with oil down at a level that so a critical range and so into that Wall  Street -- Wall Street went all in on higher oil prices after November's  OPEC meeting.  They were wrong.  They've reset.  They've been exorcised  (ph) out of the market so there's a lot of bullets sitting on the side of  Wall Street so between oil $45, $47, I do expect this range hold in the  here and now going into the summer.  Beyond the summer, it's another  question.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Hey, Stephen -- it's Michael Block.  You know, we can talk about  supply and demand.  We saw the inventory data which, you know, is a  windshield smacking bugs last week, frankly.  But, you know, the other  issue is yes, the Saudis are not the, you know -- they're not the lever  they used to be but, you know, there is some concern I'm getting from some  clients that the tension between the Saudis and Qatar is undermining the  viability of the OPEC agreement.  If there is some, you know, peace reached  here, so to speak, do you think that can be a catalyst to move out in this  range to the upside?  </p><p>SCHORK:  Not really, Michael.  I think the rift between Saudi and Qatar is  actually a bearish event.  Qatar accounts for less than 2 percent of OPEC's  production.  If Qatar were in the United States it would only be the fourth  largest producer in the United States alone.</p><p>So from a geopolitical standpoint, what we are seeing now with this rift is  once again never far from the surface, is a 1,400-year-old chasm or shall  we say the 50-year-old chasm between the Sunni side of OPEC and the Shia  side of OPEC.</p><p>And of course with Sunni Saudi taking it to the Iranian-backed Qatar Shia,  this is indeed a rift that's going to pull into question the cohesion of  OPEC.  And if you were bullish oil with regard to OPEC, you have to be very  concerned because the cartel failed miserably to balance the market in the  first six months this year.  And that's the problem because I said earlier,  the demand for crude oil here in the United States has never been stronger.</p><p>So what is going to happen in the months ahead regardless of any sort of  unity back within the cartel when over the next couple of months demand  begins to fall back off here especially in the United States and the U.S.  producer is still going to put on an extra 200,000-barrels a day of  production by the end of this year.</p><p>So at this point we are still looking at a market that is well-glutted.  So  you have to ask yourself, if OPEC could not balance the market when demand  has never been stronger, how are they going to balance it when that demand  begins to fall off towards the end of the summer while U.S. shale producers  are adding another 200,000 barrels to the market?  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Stephen -- Mitch Roschelle here.  Is there a price range where  they can turn the switch on and off sort of right now at 46 and a half --  but where is the price point where they stop production?  Where is the  price point when they start production?  </p><p>SCHORK:  Well, that curve is starting to fall further and further lower to  the chagrin of oil bulls.  So what we can say with confidence by looking at  things like the rig counts, whichever is in 50 in the last 54 weeks, you  look at the CFTC data, what the upstream guys are doing as far as hedging.</p><p>And we could also infer from the price handed back into the curve.  That  oil in that $55, $56, $57 range is when you bring a lot of production back  to the fore and we've indeed seen it.  So we know there's a lot of oil  hedged forward in that $55, $57 range.</p><p>And with the cost cover what we are seeing is they are places now that are  coming online that are making money now at that sub $50 level.  So we keep  on lowering the bar here.  Where we are now $45, $47 you would expect to  see some of that production curtail.  And if we do see further weakness as  you get through the peak summer demand season, clearly this would have an  impact.</p><p>But to answer your question to be clear on this we know $55, $56 oil is  like ringing the dinner bell for producers and anything between that and  $45 you start to see diminishing returns on production.</p><p>So it wouldn't be until you saw production -- excuse me, price well below  $40 that you would see any sort of significant knock-on to a pullback in  production.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great analysis as always.  Stephen -- you covered the world.   You covered it all for us in terms of oil.</p><p>Stephen Schork -- thank you so much.</p><p>SCHORK:  Great to be here.

But  what we don't know yet is whether the America people will actually hear  that testimony, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE RANKING MEMBER:   Don't know whether it's going to be public and I challenge the jurisdiction  to some extent, I'm on both committees as you know.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Judiciary and intelligence.</p><p>FEINSTEIN:  And -- yes.  And I believe that the judiciary committee has the  oversight responsibility for the Justice Department and therefore it is  very fitting for the Attorney General to appear there.  I've written two  letters to Senator Grassley suggesting that.</p><p>SEN. JAMES LANKFORD (R-OK), INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBER:  We have not  disclosed and finalized a public or private.  I assume that this will be  public but we're still in that final conversation time with Jeff Sessions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now to weigh in on that and so much more, Fox News  Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.  What do you think the  Attorney General be -- do you think he'll be testifying in public or  private?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  I don't know  which way they're going to go.  It's a little bit of inside the beltway in  the weeds whether he testifies before the Intelligence Committee or the  Judiciary.</p><p>My own view is Senator Feinstein is right, the Senate Judiciary Committee  has lawful oversight responsibility over the Justice Department, the  Intelligence Committee has lawful oversight over the Intelligence  Community, not over the Justice Department.  But it's an unusual testimony  because he's not going to be testifying as the Attorney General telling  them about a probe that he's conducting.  He's going to be testifying as a  witness about what he saw and heard and did, not about what the Justice  Department is doing that is fraught with danger for him should he ever have  to become a witness again.</p><p>So the question is, has he already spoken to the person for whom he may be  a witness, Bob Mueller who works for him.  This is a very, very unusual  situation.  Bob Mueller is beneath Jeff Sessions in the Justice Department,  Bob Mueller's conducting the investigation that Jeff Sessions is prohibited  from being involved in because he's a potential witness in the  investigation.  So if he's going to dispute some of the things that Former  FBI Director Jim Comey says and he does this in private, it's not going to  have the political effect that the president wants.  If he does it in  public, well then the democrats are going to try to embarrass him by  accusing him of perjury because he supposedly didn't tell the Judiciary  Committee about all the needs he have with the Russian Ambassador, do you  get all that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And all -- I love it you could love without it.  I love  when you laugh.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It is in the weeds, it is also untrod territory, I know of no  comparison in modern American political history to the situation that the  president, the Attorney General, the former Attorney General, and the  former FBI Director are in at this moment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the FBI Director Comey raised -- seem to raise and it's not  clear what he was alluding to but in his testimony last week, he raised the  possibility of other concerns about Jeff Sessions.  His dealings with  Russia during the campaign because he said that the FBI leadership before  his discussions recusal was (inaudible) that I can't discuss in an open  setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia related  investigation problematic.</p><p>Now we don't really know if this was -- it just raised an issue that  certainly Sessions needs to address or that the senators who want to --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well you ask very prudently in the intro to this segment, why  didn't Jim Comey tell his boss Jeff Sessions about the memos involving the  communications from the president and if Jim Comey believe that the  president had ordered him, though the president as we know according to  Comey didn't use the word order to lay off General Flynn, why didn't he go  to the Attorney General?</p><p>Answer from Jim Comey, I was aware of matters material to the Attorney  General which told me and career lowers in the Justice Department he was  going to be out of the case and we didn't want to prejudice him or it by  telling him that.  We'll see if that's a valid explanation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But -- and it wasn't just Attorney General Sessions that I was  referring to, I meant anybody up the chain of command in terms of Comey  saying to someone in Justice, even to Rod Rosenstein, I -- this was said to  me by President Trump to hope, comment, and there's a problem there or even  going to the White House --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's a bit of a timeline issue there because Rod  Rosenstein, he doesn't come in until the end of April and then early comes  --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Okay.  Well anybody at Justice, right?  That's my point.  Like  if it was problem, why didn't he speak out?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well these are their questions.  Look, I thought Comey's  testimony was credible and compelling but not without its flaws, not  without cracks that someone challenging him would have an opportunity to  address. </p><p>What was new to the public but not new to those of us who monitor these  things was the criticism of Loretta Lynch.  I mean he has accused her of  misconduct in office.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well let's go to that.  So in the wake of Jim Comey's testimony,  Attorney General Loretta Lynch instructed him to downplay the significance  of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.</p><p>Senators -- he was running as the judges pointing out the joke was the  Federal Bureau of Matters, not the Federal Bureau of Investigation.   Senators on both sides of the aisle are now calling for an investigation,  watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FEINSTEIN:  I would have a queasy feeling too though to be candid with you.   I think we need to know more about that and there's only one way to know  about it and that's to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R) SOUTH CAROLINA:  The Attorney General's office has  become a political office, that's bad for us all.  So I want to get to the  bottom of that and it should be in Judiciary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Judge, what could possibly come out of anything in the  investigation?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well she could be indicted for misconduct in office.  I mean  he has laid out a case that she made decisions that to move the levers of  power in the Justice Department based upon the political needs of Barrack  Obama and the Clinton campaign.</p><p>The only evidence he has given for that are two things, the meeting with  Bill Clinton, we all know about that in the Tarmac in Phoenix which is  still unexplained and in y view probably unexplainable in that context.   But the effort to get the FBI to see the same language that the Clinton  campaign was using to characterize the FBI investigation and Mrs. Clinton,  language which is alien to law enforcement and alien to the FBI by calling  it a matter.  We don't do matters, we do criminal investigations.  He  eventually said when he had enough of this might very well be misconduct in  office.  The use of federal law enforcement for a domestic political  purpose would conduct -- would constitute a misconduct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  He held back no punches.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  Bottom line, as a result of his testimony, there were at  least two or three more investigations which will commence.  But the newest  one, the one we're talking about to Obama people not of Trump people.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Incredible.  Judge --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Staying on top of it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it you're here.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST:  Totally.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love all the time I've gotten to spend with you in the last  week.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It was beautiful.  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Judge Andrew Napolitano covering it all for you.  Coming up, a  bumpy ride ahead for Uber, the fallout as another one of the company's top  executives reportedly faces pressure to resign.</p><p>And GOLFTEC teeing up big changes, the company CEO joining us to talk about  how new tech can improve your gold game.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uber could be facing some major changes at the top after a  highly anticipated board meeting, Tracee Carrasco has all the details, good  morning Tracee.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  Now, Uber's board  of directors met on Sunday to discuss all of its recent issues on the  table.  A possible leave of absence for embattled CEO Travis Kalanick and  the potential resignation of Chief Business Officer, Emil Michael.</p><p>A leave of absence for Kalanick comes at a time of both personal and  professional turmoil.  Now the 40-year-old mother recently died in a  boating accident at the end of May, his father was also injured in the  accident and Kalanick has been tending to him.  And just last week, race-y  memo Kalanick sent to Uber employee in 2013 was released and then in  February Kalanick was also seen in a video yelling at an Uber driver.  As  per Michael, he could resign as early as today.  Now, that's according to a  report from the Wall Street Journal.  If you remember in 2014 Michael  suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition to dig into the personal  lives of journalists who reported negatively about Uber.  </p><p>Michael's departure is said to be related to an internal investigation into  Uber's workplace culture by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.   Holder's investigation comes after 20 manager and other employees were  fired last week for claims of harassment, discrimination, and bullying,  Holder's recommendations for the company were presented at from his board  meeting which could also include a new HR process training and to address  the future of key executive including Emil Michael and Travis Kalanick.   Now, Uber has not issued any comments on these recent developments.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- and Michael, just to open up to the panel, this race is  an issue about if Kalanick has to step aside at least for a short time,  take a leave of absence.  Who's running the show over there given the  turmoil, given the management shakeup that is still ongoing?</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  What I want to  know is -- I'll start up by asking a question Tracee, how prevalent is this  sort of culture in Silicon Valley?</p><p>We always hear that everyone in Silicon Valley is so open-minded.  There  seems to be this entitlement like we're talented programmers and creators  of these businesses, therefore we can run wild frankly.  It sounds like a  very frat boy type culture.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch can answer that.  Not that you're a frat boy but -- I mean  he's worked with --  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  I was.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, that's what you do for a living, you're a consultant.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you would have a sense of how Uber's personal -- culture if  you will.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The interesting thing about Uber that people forget is the  headquarter staff is different than everybody we're dealing with every day,  right?</p><p>BLOCK:  Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I'm talking about the management team and the corporate  culture.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It could be culture problem driving and driving and driving, no  pun intended towards the goal of creating that company and it's just  created a very unusual environment that you don't see in too many other  enterprises because there's story after story after story there.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Well Kalanick after that viral video, he did come out and  apologize and said, \"I need to grow up, I need to be a little more mature.\"   And I think that's one of the things we're really seeing.  He's 40-years- old running this company and I think --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I know within Silicon Valley people who work at other  companies have been for a long time very uncomfortable with what was going  on at Uber and you can see -- and then this is even before you begin to  really see it on the outside with the reporter who was essentially tracked  with the executive who had the medical records of a rape victim in India.   With -- I mean just more and more keeps bubbling up and coming out.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, regardless.  I mean people actually -- given this culture,  I'm an Uber user, I might be too stubborn or lazy to actually change my  current app and move over to service such as Lyft.  I don't know if it's  enough to get me to move.  </p><p>I just want -- when you want a car, hello, I'm here.  Come pick me up.  I'm  not sure that I'm thinking of, \"Oh my gosh, what has the CEO -- what has he  done?\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If the service was better --  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Then I would give --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If the service was super great and people would be so quick to  move over to Lyft and there are a lot of -- I mean you talk about this,  there are a lot of other services, just the taxi -- like taxi and limousine  commission here in New York City is really trying to --  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And they have an app now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I've used it once, never again.  Tracee thank you so  much.  Tracee Carrasco all over the Uber story.</p><p>Coming up, get your game out of rot, the CEO of GOLFTEC will join us to  talk what is next for the golf instructing giant.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (inaudible) outright lead at 15 and a left edge cut for  Berger. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In case you missed it, that was Daniel Berger winning the PGA  Tour as FedEx St. Jude classic yesterday in Tennessee, Berger shot a 10  under to win the cup.</p><p>And now that summer is almost here, golfers are looking to brush up their  gold skills.  Let's bring in CEO of GOLFTEC, Joe Assell.  Joe, good to see  you.  Tell us all about what you guys are up to.</p><p>JOE ASSELL, CEO, GOLFTEC:  Good morning Dagen, thank you for having me.   Well we are on quite a roll right now.  Our business has been growing for  years in a row but we decided it was time to get even better and evolve as  a company and we rolled out quite a few new things this year with an  enhanced way to sell golf clubs and a rebrand and a refresh to our customer  experience when they come to see us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mitch Roschelle has a question being an avid golfer himself.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  And I probably need all the lessons I can get.  Joe,  there are headwinds or maybe in golf speak I should say like a two-club win  in the golf business.  We're seeing rounds going down, country clubs are  shuttering just because there's not as much demand.  Is your business sort  of immune to that or is your business the solution to it?</p><p>ASSELL:  I think a little bit of both.  So our sales have gone straight up  for years, we're up a hundred percent the last seven years.  So it hasn't  been affecting us as much and we do think we're quite a bit of a solution.  </p><p>We gave 900,000 golf lessons last year and as people take lessons, they get  better and research shows as you get better, you play and spend a lot more.   So we definitely think we're part of the solution to help golf and it  really has been stabilizing lately.  Golfers are flat, new golfers last  year were more than -- it's the highest rate in 10 years of new people  entering the game and golf is starting to turn the corner a little bit  these days.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why do you suspect that Joe?  Is it just -- and I don't mean  this as an insult but as younger people are getting older and golf just  seems like -- it seems like a much more attractive sport, all the  incredibly technical and difficult, it's not as taxing on the body, it's  saying even playing tennis.</p><p>ASSELL:  Yes, you're right.  We have the baby boomers coming our way and  research shows that their golf spending doubles the day they retire and it  isn't as taxing and they can play golf and there's a forecast for increase  round by baby boomers.</p><p>But then you have new ways to play golf, you have topgolf, you have  simulators, and you have things that are attracting both the millennial  group right now and kids.  Golf was the fastest growing sport among girls  of any sport in America last year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Topgolf is fun.  Yes, I think there's one at the MGM Grand if my  memory serves --  </p><p>ASSELL:  Yes, there is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So Joe, GOLFTEC is partnering with True Spec in creating new  golf clubs, can you tell us about GOLFTEC's place in the retail environment  and why did you start selling equipment?</p><p>ASSELL:  So you were number one in the world at golf lessons but to play  your best, you need a golf club to match that swing.  And we've always  (inaudible) but we thought it was time to really enhance how we do it.</p><p>And today, with the inner-changeability of heads and shafts, you have so  much more option variety to put two and tow tighter to make the best club  for you.  And then once you do that, you need somebody to build it for you  and True Spec is our assembly partner.  Once we dial in the exact shaft to  optimize performance for our customers, True Spec will put it together for  us.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Joe, the average GOLFTEC student drops seven strokes with their  scorecards, so is this cheating?  At what point is technology if the club  going to swing itself?  </p><p>ASSELL: I hope not, that would put us out of business.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Be good for putters like me though.</p><p>ASSELL:  You know, golf is hard -- golf is hard and it's great for business  but for us, when we combine big data with proprietary software, with PGA  pros, it works and our students really quite a bit.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes, I need all the help I can get.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe, real quick, prediction for the U.S. Open.</p><p>ASSELL:  Well it can be a very long golf course and they've never had a  major championship there so no one really knows what it will bring.</p><p>But I think a long hitter and then the other big aspect this week is  there's a lot of land and the holes are really far apart and there's a lot  of walking from one hole to the next and it's going to take some stamina,  so I lean towards a younger player, a more fit player who's a long hitter.   So it wouldn't surprise me at all if Dustin Johnson repeats this year from  last year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ah, you took the words out of my mouth.  By the way, I worked on  a golf course but I drove the beverage cart.</p><p>ASSELL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When I was -- after I got my college degree by the way.  So you  see how much my college degree was --  </p><p>ASSELL:  That's a great summer job.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it was.  Unfortunately I just gotten BA.  Joe, it was great  to see you.  Joe Assell.  And we're going to be live from the U.S. Open in  Erin Hills Thursday and Friday morning.  Yes, Maria Bartiromo at the U.S.  Open.  Thursday and Friday, the whole show 6:00am to 9:00, we'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 12th.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 12th.  Your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  Getting the agenda back on track, President  Trump expected to unveil a new jobs push in Wisconsin, tomorrow.  The move  comes as the White House moves past the controversy surrounding Jim Comey's  testimony last week.  First Daughter, Ivanka Trump, was asked on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" earlier about her father's response to that controversy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  My father felt very  vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels  incredibly optimistic but, you know, at the White House and throughout the  administration we were incredibly focused on the reason we all went to  Washington.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.</p><p>TRUMP:  And what we're fighting for.  So last week, while it didn't get the  level of headlines, it will ultimately have a much more important impact,  it was infrastructure week, focusing on the commitment to rebuild this  country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More from Ivanka Trump's interview ahead.  Outrage in Central  Park, a New York City play using a President Trump look-alike for the role  of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  The fallout as both Delta and Bank of  America pulled their sponsorships.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, Jeff Immelt out at General Electric.  The  company announcing earlier this morning that he will be replaced by John  Flannery as chairman and CEO.  Flannery, the current president and CEO of  G.E. Healthcare.  G.E. shares up three percent on the news, that stock down  this year, down in the last year, and down about 28 percent during Immelt's  tenure since 2001.</p><p>Futures are showing losses across the board, 34-point loss on the Dow  Futures, we keep a very close eye on what happens with technology stocks.   These big names, your Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Apple, and  Microsoft had been your major market leaders, pulling the rest of the  market along all year and they took a beating on Friday and many of them  lower in premarket trading.</p><p>In Europe, stocks also heading south, we have a one percent loss in France  and in Germany.  Same story in Asia overnight, you have red across your  screen with the biggest loser there being the Hang Seng, down one and a  quarter percent.</p><p>And the Penguins putting the Predators on ice.  Pittsburgh topping  Nashville to win its second straight Stanley Cup.  The highlights from that  big win ahead.  Plus, Jimmy Carter, the president - former president taking  flight, the former leader of the free world, a video of him going viral  after he took the time to great everyone on his plane.  The presidential  surprise for passengers, the surprise being Mr. Carter was flying  commercial.  There you go.  All of that -- cancer survivor, by the way, as  well, all of that and so much more coming up.</p><p>Financial analyst, Heather Zumarraga, Rhino Trading Partners Chief  Strategist, Michael Block, and PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle.  Good to see  you, one and all, this morning.  </p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's on your mind?  Immelt out.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER &amp; BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LEADER:  I'm interested  to see what happens with those big tech names because if they start to  continue to sell off, they're so heavy in the indices, that it could start  dragging the market down and start getting everybody worried that Trump  rally is a thing of the past.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Dated.  NASDAQ down 1.8 percent on Friday.  We'll see if we get  some follow through today to see if there's a sector rotation, as the  NASDAQ is pulling back, the Dow has been hitting new all-time highs.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: And the Russell 2000, the small-cap stocks (INAUDIBLE) a record  on Friday.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  That's a good story though.  </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  The Russell caught  up too.  Yes.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. </p><p>BLOCK:  Russell caught up because everyone was shorted?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL: Sector rotation. </p><p>BLOCK:  No, no.  It's squeezing.  Full state of rotation continues.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And the Fed is hiking this week.  </p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Yes.  Very important.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I mean, take that one to the bank I think what Jon  Hilsenrath would have done.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- got lost in the headlines when you never know what happens  with Sessions' testimony.  So .</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll keep it in the headlines right here on Fox Business as we  always do.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We can talk about everything.  Joining the conversation this  morning, former Texas Congressman Presidential Candidate, Ron Paul, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Mr. Stuart Varney.  We always love to see Mr.  Varney.  To our story this hour, today is the deadline for parties  challenging the president's travel ban to respond to a petition from  justice department. </p><p>The petition asks the Supreme Court to allow the president's executive  order to go into effect.  Despite opposition, Texas Attorney General Ken  Paxton says the president has the right to enact this ban.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEN PAXTON, TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL:  We think we're absolutely right on the  law, there's a federal law that clearly gives the president the authority  to do this.  This travel ban is right in line with that statute.  And so,  we're confident if the court actually follows federal law, that the  president will be just fine.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is the co-founder of Diligence LLC, former CIA  Operative Mike Baker.  I don't even know where you are but I know you  parachuted in or tunneled in.  </p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA OPERATIVE:  He can't tell you where he is.  I'm at  the - I'm at the compound right now.  It's a secret - it's a secret  location except I got a picture of it behind me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is why you have to - this is why you have to follow Mike on  Twitter because it's always like he's on a - like a gator boat, like a fan  boat coming in.</p><p>BAKER:  Get in your boat -- </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, is these bans a significant step in focusing on national  security?  </p><p>BAKER:  Well, you know, it's become this outsized thing that is chewing up  a lot of political capital and a lot of - a lot of attention and it really  didn't need to, it's important and it - and it should be done, and the  previous administration, you know, the Obama administration had identified  and outlined the same problem but because of the messaging issues, the  discipline coming out of the White House in this current administration,  it's unfortunately - it's taken on this concept that somehow the travel ban  is critical for national security.  Well, it's an element of national  security.</p><p>It is a very simple process, you've got these states, these nations that  are essentially failed states.  And the previous administration agreed and  the idea being is, well, let's take a break, let's review internally our  processes for how we -- how we do a the vetting, how we do the due  diligence, the background checking on people who want to come to this  country from these particular failed states, where there's no  infrastructure, there's no ability to reach in and in a logical and  efficient manner, check databases and talk to people to understand who are  these people that want to come in.</p><p>It's s simply that and then once you do that, fine, improve your systems  and the suspension is over.  But that's not the way it works, so it's  become this thing that like I said is just chewing up a tremendous amount  of political capital.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At the same time that you have this new developing diplomatic  crisis in the Middle East with Qatar, now hiring Former Attorney General  John Ashcroft in response to accusation that the nation supports terror  groups in the region.  Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf nations cut  diplomatic ties with Qatar last week over the terror allegations, Egyptian  billionaire businessman Naguib Sawiris backing the decision on Wall Street  Week when he talked to Maria on Friday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK MORNINGS WITH MARIA HOST:  Tell us  why you're advising your colleagues in business to take their money out of  Qatar right now?  </p><p>NAGUIB SAWIRIS, EGYPTIAN BILLIONAIRE BUSINESSMAN:  Well, I'm not just  advising them to take their money out to Qatar, I'm advising them not to  deal with Qatar, point, you know, because we are all watching every day, we  wake up hearing a lunatic that - or a savage person that went -- goes with  the car and kills innocent people or like in my own country here, they stop  the bus with children and women and shot the - shot the men in front of the  eyes of the women and every day we hear all these incidents, you know.</p><p>And nobody is doing anything against it and we need to come to the bottom  of that and the -- one country that declares openly that it is supporting  terror, you know, like Hamas or other organizations that's siding with Iran  openly that all intelligence services of the world have all materials  showing that they're supporting all the terrorists and extremist groups in  Middle East from Libya, in Syria, in Iraq and everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike, what is this rift in Qatar mean for us because again, this  comes on the heels of Obama-backed and brokered Iranian nuclear deal.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  And then - and, you know, that sound bite there, gave away  the sort of the reason why this has exploded into an issue, and it's Iran.   So this is essentially at the top line, a conflict between the Saudis and  Iran, and the Saudis, Iran obviously has their Lex Luthor and, you know,  they are locked in this battle for influence and in the region.  So the  Saudis have exerted a great deal of pressure on some of these other  countries that Egypt included to isolate Qatar.</p><p>You know, the truth of the matter is that, you know, they're all complicit  in different ways over different periods of time and either financing or  somehow supporting or looking the other way in terms of Islamic extremism.   So Qatar doesn't stand alone in that and what needs to happen and what's  going to be extremely difficult is, you know, the U.S. in particular, we're  going to need to find a way to step into that breach and bring them back  together in a fashion because we're not going to - we're not going to do  this, we're not going to beat terrorism by isolating Qatar.</p><p>You know, we've got a military base there, and different things can be true  at the same time in Middle East.  You can be working with a partner out  there who on one hand, at a one side of their mouth helps you with certain  terrorist operations or providing intelligence, to us and our liaise on  partners, at the same time there can be elements within that government  that sympathize or support terrorism or business that do same thing.  You  got, you know, you got to deal with, you know, the world is that exists and  not try to find some perfect ending.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Mike, Mitch Roschelle, with all those Sunni-Shia conflict  that's going on, doesn't Iran just need trading partners and maybe they  were looking to make a friend in Qatar because there's so many players in  the region that just will trade with them and they need trading partners?</p><p>BAKER:  Well, sure, they like as many trading partners as possible but, you  know, over the top of that is the fact that Iran is doing it for the  regime's best interest which is to drive a wedge between these countries  and to try to degree possible to pull them out of the Saudi sphere.  Again,  this is - this is a Saudi-Iranian dispute.  I wouldn't ascribe any sort of  innocent economic reasoning behind anything that the Iranian regime does.</p><p>So I think - I think your take on it, while there is an element of economic  truth there, the reality is it's more nefarious than that.  </p><p>BLOCK:  Mike, what's the - what's the endgame for Qatar here?  Because  they've been very Machiavellian I would say, they play from both sides,  they're friends with everybody that have Al-Jazeera, you know (INAUDIBLE)  they deal with Iran, they were dealing with the west - we have the big base  there, you know, it sounds like probably they're getting called on playing  both sides here.  How does this end for them?  Is there something that  taunts where that continues or is the line drawn and they have to choose a  side or have a side chosen for them?  </p><p>BAKER:  No.  I don't think it's going to be a hardline decision at the end  where they, you know, that's it, there's a final break from, you know, from  the -- sort of this traditional alliance where, you know, to some degree  they have been aligned with UAE and Egypt and the others, and Saudis.  I  think what will happen is -- I hope what will happen is that there will be  a significant diplomatic effort led by Rex Tillerson and some others.</p><p>And at the end of the day, we'll heal the rift to some degree, they'll open  the borders, there will be business but we have to be pragmatic and  understand that, you know, again, there will be this duplicity that exists,  so that's not just - again, it's not just Qatar.  I mean, look at the  Saudis in the way over the time they dealt with the devil, they've turned  the other way and in terms of allowing the extremism to build in exchange  for, you know, stability within the kingdom.</p><p>So, you know, the Middle East is one of those places where, you know, it's  on satisfactory but you have to deal with who exists there and you have to  understand it would be very, very hard line pragmatic about this to  understand that they're going to be duplicities in the way that they act  when it comes to extremism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike, when you leave, do you ignite your jet propulsion pack  since why you're sitting in the state.  Why right out? </p><p>BAKER:  Yes.  Yes.  We tend to - everything disappears, you know, it's a  little bit like Mr. Wolfe, you know, you got to clean the place up and then  you go and, you know, and you find another place where we can do another  segment.  But yes, it's - it is what it is.  Look, I'm out in Idaho, I'm  going to release that information to the public, I was going to give it to  a friend and then you're going to hand it the press but I'm in Idaho, and  anybody out there watching hasn't been to Idaho, I'm here to tell you, it's  one of the greatest states in the nation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really is.  It is stunningly beautiful but I would deeply,  deeply appreciate your Winston Wolfe reference.  </p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Baker.  Big love always.  Mike Baker joining us.</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A scare in the air for flyers aboard at flight to  Shanghai, a plane forced to turn around after a hole rips open in the  engine.  And a shake-up at the top of General Electric, Jeff Immelt out.   We look at future of this company because the road since he took over in  '01 was a lo rocky one.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news this morning.  General Electric getting a new  leader.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey Dagen,  that's right.  G.E. CEO Jeff Immelt is retiring, he's ending a 16-year run  as the leader of industrial conglomerate.  He's going to be replaced by  John Flannery in August who's currently the president and CEO of G.E.  Healthcare.  Now, the possible move first reported by our very ow3n Charlie  Gasparino.  He broke that news on the tensions between Immelt and activist  investor Nelson Peltz.</p><p>That report from Charlie - excuse me, was back in March.  General Electric  says Immelt is going to remain chairman of the board through the end of the  year.  Flannery going to take on that title, January 1st.  Immelt has taken  steps to reship - reshape G.E. after the financial crisis for the company.   They have struggled a boost profit there.  As you can see, there is the  stock in the premarket, it is rallying.  G.E. shares are rallying up a  little more than three percent.  That will actually help balance out the  Dow when we open up at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.  </p><p>Also, we're following this story for you.  A huge hole in a China Eastern  plane forced an emergency landing in Australia.  Passengers of the flight  from the city to Shanghai said the engine made a massive amount of noise  right after takeoff.  Pilots reported problems about an hour into the  journey.  The plane had to return to Sydney, it land safely.  Passengers  were evacuated from plane but luckily, there were no injuries there.</p><p>Well, a Trump t-shirt censored in a high school yearbook.  Grant Berardo  took his high school pictures in New Jersey wearing Trump campaign shirt,  this is Make America Great Again but the t-shirt was later digitally  altered to remove the campaign slogan in the actual yearbook.  The school  superintendent is investigating this, says there is no policy prohibiting  political messages in schools pictures.</p><p>And then this, passengers on a recent Delta Airlines flight got a big  surprise.  Former President Jimmy Carter was on board and before the plane  took off, he walked up and down the aisle shook hands with passengers.   They were really excited.  There you go.  This is the tweeted video shows  the 92-year-old former president smiling as he walked down the aisle.  He  greets everybody.  The passenger tweeted the video, said, everybody seemed  really excited.  And the overall sense it was just really nice to have that  kind of moment where party or politics \"Didn't matter.\"  One of the most --  I think revered ex-presidents we have living today, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) but a cancer survivor, you know, he went on one of  these Immunotherapy drugs from the Kansas spread to his brain spectacular  until -</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  And look at him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Spectacular --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- recovery.  I wish the president talked more about that  actually.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up.  The Penguins iced the  Predators to keep the cup in Pittsburg.  Highlights from the repeat NHL  title victory in nearly 20 years.</p><p>And bling with a zing, how to Patriots are using their Super Bowl reign to  remind the Falcons off their incredible comeback in February.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The hockey season coming to a close after an exciting Stanley  Cup final between the Penguins the Predators.  Jared Max is here with the  highlights.  Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 AMERICAN SPORTS REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.   I thought we were headed for sudden death overtime last night.  0-0 game  until under two minutes remaining.  Game six Stanley Cup final in  Nashville, the Predators fans continue their tradition, throwing catfish on  the ice and it looked like the Predators had reeled in the first goal of  the game.  Colton Sissons taps it in after Pittsburg goalie Matt Murray was  unable to control Filip Forsberg's shot.  1-0 Predators, right?  Wrong!</p><p>Officials had lost sight of the puck and one blew a whistle to signal the  play dead, fraction of a second before the puck went in.  0-0 to the third  and then the Penguins get this weird goal from behind the net, the former  Predator Patric Hornqvist sneaks it past Pekka Rinne, this goal counted.   Penguins 1-0, a minute later they scored through an empty net.  Celebration  was on a first time in era of salary cap.  One team wins the Stanley Cup  two straight seasons.  Penguins' parade will be this week.  No official  date yet.</p><p>Could be preparing for another championship parade and NBA one for the  Golden State Warriors soon.  Warriors up three games to one and the  Cavaliers favored to win tonight by 8.5 points, tip off scheduled for just  after 9:00 Eastern in Oakland.  We all know Air Jordans are not cheap  sneakers but what about a pair of real about Michael Jordans?  As in sneaks  worn by the basketball legend in his final game as an amateur.  Well, the  sneakers that Jordan wore in the gold medal game in the '84 Olympics at  Spain sold at auction yesterday for $190,373.  Almost 200 grand.  Yes,  highest known price paid for game-worn shoes.  I even had Jordans orthotics  and the autograph.</p><p>Back page of the New York Post today asks the question, he hit it how far?   New York Yankees star Aaron Judge, longest homerun in Major League Baseball  since ESPN began tracking distance of homeruns in 2009.  Watch this.  Now  Judge hit two homeruns in the Yankees 14-3 win over Orioles.  This was his  first.  It traveled 4696 feet.  He is first Yankees since Mickey Mantle in  1956 two hit homers in the same game, he goes four for four, first Yankees  since Roger Maris, age 25 or younger to hit 20 homeruns before the all-star  break.  Judge has 21, he's batting 344. </p><p>Football.  You know, football said to be the sport of kings, better than  diamond rings but maybe not this ring.  Check this out, past Friday night;  New England Patriots owner Robert Craft hosted a private ceremony for his  players and team members at his home.  Well, they all got their  championship rings.  Remember that 28 to 3 comeback against the Atlanta  Falcons in Super Bowl?  So, 283 rings to recognize the 28 to 3 comeback.   283 diamonds are on this ring, it totals 5.1 carats.  And all Tom Brady  showing it off along with Martellus Bennett.  So they have a 28 to 3, a  little bit of a dig at the Falcons and also a couple of quotes on the  rings, as well from Bob Craft, the team owner, unequivocally the sweetest  and also greatest comeback all-time.  How about those rings?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't wear them all at the same time.  </p><p>BLOCK:  It should have had two big diamonds on them to represent the two  times they couldn't beat the Giants in Super Bowl.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There you go.</p><p>MAX:  I like that.

And breaking news  these mornings, Jeff Immelt out at General Electric.  He will be replaced  by John Flannery as Chairman and CEO.  Flannery is the current President  and CEO of G.E. health care.

Blake Burman at the White House with more.  Good  morning, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there,  Dagen.  Good morning to you as well.  Last week at the White House was  infrastructure week at a rollout.  It got a bit muddled once Jim Comey  headed to Capitol Hill.  This week, they have got a new focus somewhat of a  round two.  They will be focusing on workforce development.  The main push  here according to top officials, at the White House, is on trying to build  out apprenticeship to that end.  The President will be headed on the road  this week, tomorrow, he will be going to Wisconsin, speaking at a trade  school in Waukesha, Wednesday to Labor Department, Thursday, here at the  White House.  </p><p>He has a roundtable with several state governors.  This whole issue of  workforce development has been a push of Ivanka Trump.  She was on \"FOX &amp;  FRIENDS\" this morning to tout rollout administration will be having  throughout the week and she admitted that there has been -- as she put it a  level of visual viciousness in Washington, that caught her off guard. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DAUGHTER:  I didn't expect it to be easy.   I think some of the distractions and some of the ferocity was -- I was a  little blindsided by on a personal level. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  So, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this workforce development roll  out, Dagen, Friday sources tell Fox that the President will end his  workweek in Miami where he will unveil his administration's policies as it  relates to Cuba.  You can expect at least somewhat of a rollback of the  Obama administration policies to that end.</p><p>By the way, later today here at the White House, the start off to the week  the President will have a full cabinet meeting.  All the members of his  cabinet.  Dagen, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for covering all that for us.  Blake Burman at  the White House.  Joining us now is former Texas Congressman and Republican  Presidential candidate, Dr. Ron Paul.  Congressman, the President is set to  hold -- Blake mentioned, first full cabinet meeting today.  Do you think  this administration will now be able to move forward on the agenda that  Americans want the reason they voted for him? </p><p>RON PAUL, FORMER TEXAS CONGRESSMAN:  It is not likely but let's hope they  move forward on right things because everything they say is not exactly  going to solve all our problems.  I don't happen to believe public works  projects is a way to get more jobs.  You might get more jobs but it won't  be same as if you got more jobs in private sector.  They make a lot of  mistakes.  I think obstacles are so great and people don't recognize the  debt.  When you have a lot of debt, it's hard to spend money.  You come up  with a trillion dollars for military and a trillion dollars for public  works and repairing highways, where is the money going to come from?  And  this has an effect at marketplaces eventually.  If you look at how much  debt is out there whether it's automobile debt, college debt, personal debt  and even housing debt right now, I mean, there is a lot of problems so that  is why I think they are stymied because the fundamentals don't change.  You  can say these jobs -- the truth is dependent on government creating jobs or  there's something wrong with the plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I am going to push back in terms of the  infrastructure plan and I will and you call it public works.  I come on  that I know that means you mean to evoke FDR's programs of the depression. </p><p>PAUL:  I do, I do. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is what you say it but trillion dollars is not going to be  -- actually a minority of it would be government money.  Under the way, the  plan is laid out now.  They would -- Trump administration would get to  trillion largely in parts from funding through private investors and the  money is indeed out there.  It was $59 billion raised last year in private  infrastructure funds.  Their goal is too easy the permitting process, easy  regulations to get that money invested in projects alongside the  government. </p><p>PAUL:  Yes.  The easing of regulations is very good and that is getting out  of the way house in order, but this whole thing is partnership that bothers  libertarians because partnerships, big businesses big banks in government  isn't exactly what a free society is all about.  That is not what a  Republic is about because only favored people get to do the dealing.  So I  don't like partnership.  I want an environment where people can be  competitive and produce things that are necessary.  But saying that we are  going to have big government financing and big business financing, there is  a lot of shortcomings with that plan. </p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, RHINO TRADING PARTNERS CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Dr. Paul, Mike  Block here.  You raised a very valid concerns about debt levels and  something people worry about except, I don't want to turn into a discussion  on bond market, the bond yields are not reflecting a lot of concern about  all this spending that you are talking about.  The capital markets have  this wrong?  Is there something else going on here? </p><p>PAUL:  Yes.  I think they do.  I am not an investor but just from an  economic viewpoint, I do.  You might have said tech stocks were good  investment and things happen in a flash and bond markets can happen that  way too, because all countries are in debt, and you know we have the  European problem where you have Greece, and Italy, and Spain having  problems but you are going to have something pop up.  It's going to be very  devastating but if you look at prices, when prices go high, when you have  inflation, it is dangerous.  So when you are saying bonds are pretty  comfortable, you are saying that there is euphoria in the bond market;  prices are very, very high; and I think it is where the bubble is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I have been talking about that since 2009 and I  will admit I have been dead wrong.  Mitch, you got a question for the  congressman?  Saying that there is euphoria in the bond market prices are  very, very high.  And I think it is.  I have been talking about that --  congressman I have been talking about that since 2009, and I will admit I  have been dead wrong.  Mitch, a question for the Congressman? </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  You are not wrong, you are not  wrong.  But you can't predict his timing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe I will be right.  I am sleeping in the dark.  Congressman,  I want Mitch to get a question for you. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  OK.  When you look at the agenda with so few days really left  in Session, where are the priorities?  Is tax reform going to sort of fall  about by way sided something we go back and reduce rates to stimulate the  economy?</p><p>PAUL:  When you say end of the session you mean for summer break? </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, correct. </p><p>PAUL:  That sort of thing? </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  No.  They are not going to get that done there's too many  special interests.  They should just be cutting, spending and cutting taxes  and if you can't cut it all one time cut something.  But no.  They want the  whole package which I understand.  But it's not enough agreement.   Everybody has their ax to grind.  It's going to be hard to get them  together besides a lot of Republicans are not dedicated to what I am  talking about.  They are dedicated to taking care of their friends.  I  mean, if -- you know, it takes medical care.  They have a lot of friends in  the insurance industry, and the drug industry.  </p><p>They are not liable to change that and cut down real spending.  They will  do their talking but, Dagen, when you start cutting back it is a problem.   I mean, it is hard to get an addict off drugs and that is what we're trying  to do.  First, I don't think they start with the basic principle.  The  government ought to be very limited and strive for that.  They say  government -- we just need better management.  I don't buy into that.  I  think we have too much mismanagement. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, real quick.  Heather.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, SUNAMERICA FUNDS VICE PRESIDENT:  Dr. Paul, the Federal  Reserve is set to hike interest rates this Wednesday.  A quarter basis  point.  You're talking about our debt levels.  What will that effect have  on interest rates to service this debt? </p><p>PAUL:  Oh it is going to being up, supposed the market has already  discounted that, but no, if they creep up, what would happen if we had a  market rate of interest which is what we need to get economy.  What if  interest rates were three percent?  This whole worldwide system would  collapse because everything depends on more and more and more now they are  tinkering a quarter point here, a quarter point there.  They are really not  doing a whole lot so I don't think this is a trend at all.  </p><p>I think this is wishful thinking.  I think that if you go up a little bit  more even if a little bit is going to be a bigger burden on the treasury.   This is where so much production has to go eventually with increase in  interest rates, and eventually interest rates will go up, then that pay all  the production.  We cannot pay it.  We cannot pay.  We have to print more  money! </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Keep printing.  Good to see you.  Congressman Ron Paul,  take care of yourself.  </p><p>Still ahead, do they protect too much?  Stuart Varney weighs in on the  outrage after New York City play used a President Trump look-alike in the  role of the assassinated Julius Caesar.  Why analysts are going sour on  Apple.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  GE shares jumping after the company announced CEO Jeff Immelt is  leaving.  Nicole Petallides covering the story at New York Stock Exchange.   Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We have this upside this  morning for General Electric looking up about three percent right now, 3.7  percent so good move for GE who's been under pressure and overall but needs  to cut costs and outperform a little bit.  It has been under pressure.   Shareholders were not too happy with Jeff Immelt particularly Trion funds  and so he will be stepping down and John Flannery who is a 30-year veteran  there will move up to the top spot of CEO and that will happen on August  1st.  And so GE gets a pop.</p><p>Watching also Microsoft which sold off of all tech stocks on Friday but  it's come out now about the new X-Box 1x.  OK, this is supposed to be their  smallest ever X-Box 499.  Everybody is waiting for this one.  It's supposed  to have the graphics and the memory and speed, bandwidth and sound as well  to really outpace the whole industry.  And that will be available in time  for the holidays.  </p><p>And last but not least, watching Apple which sold off in a big way on  Friday.  In fact, it's biggest selloff in 14 months weighed on Dow, shaved  off 41 points on Friday, it is down again cutting it this morning but still  saying it's going to be strong for the holiday season, still liking the  iPhone but this is really evaluation call because we have seen tech stocks  really run up.  And it's not even 5 percent of the 52-week high.  Back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much.  Nicole Petallides in the New York  Stock Exchange.  Another controversy surrounding creative depictions of the  President.  Two sponsors, major corporations, pulling out of the  Shakespeare In The Park here in New York City after a production of Julius  Caesar shows a Donald Trump look alike being stabbed to death on the Senate  floor.  Again, it's a play.  It's Shakespeare.  So, who do we go to?   British man.  Host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY,\" Stuart.  Of course, you're  going to talk about Shakespeare this morning, my friend.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK VARNEY AND COMPANY HOST:  You don't  know what to call me, do you?  You were just kind of lost there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to call you -- I was going to say, superstar. </p><p>VARNEY:  No let's not get crazy.  Look, I am picking up on what our viewers  are seeing on the left-hand side of the screen, Shakespeare in the Park.   It's really kind of pass, for New York but not voters in the rest of the  country.  I think they are appalled to see our President, a man looking  like our President being stabbed to death in Central Park for Shakespeare  in the Park.  The audience apparently just loved it.  That is New York, I  guess.  I think it is dangerous.  This comes on top of the severed head  from Kathy Griffin.  </p><p>I just think that we are leading the country in entirely the wrong  direction, leading it towards a violent confrontation between left and  right.  I don't think that is good for anybody.  But then, let's not forget  Democrat senator from New York over the weekend, dropping the \"f\" bomb in  public right there.  I have to believe that, that was focus group tried and  tested.  This is how you appeal to millennials, use obscene language.  I  think it is a dangerous situation, and I think it is something that voters  are going to reject.  That is where I am coming from. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I felt like when she said that, Stuart, it was the equivalent of  a 3-year-old making flatulent sounds.  They do it for attention. </p><p>VARNEY:  Juveniles.  The snickering going on in the audience and by her.   It is beneath the office of senator and it should not be taking place in  our country at this time.  </p><p>The level of public discourse is gone down at tubes and the level of  violence displayed against and the contempt displaced for our President  knows no bounds I think it's counterproductive for us all. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A British gentleman.  That's what I -- </p><p>VARNEY:  An American.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are.  You are you are the -- the represent greatest that is  America in terms of the opportunities that this nation provides and how you  seized upon it cherish it, I mean that Stuart, you talk about it all the  time. </p><p>VARNEY:  Well thank you very much indeed, Dagen, I appreciate that I do  thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, we'll see you in exactly 10 minutes, Stuart,  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.  Coming up  Uber, planning to put its troubles in the rear view mirror, a key executive  reportedly resigning amid questions about the company's workplace culture  the fallout for the ride-sharing giant. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The mastermind behind terror attacks on two landmarks in Iran  last week apparently has been killed.  Cheryl Casone has details on that. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, so Dagen according to the  New York Times, the top official in Iran says that intelligence officers  hunted down and killed the man behind attacks in Iran.  ISIS said it is  behind the assault in Iran's parliament and the Mausoleum of Ayatollah  Khomeini, the founder of Islamic Republic of course that killed 17 people  that attack while the newspaper says Iranian investigators are looking into  the attacks, increasingly focusing a on group of radicalized Iranian Kurds. </p><p>OK.  Back in here in home Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may temporarily step  aside this potential move coming on the heels of Uber's board of Directors,  adopting a series of recommendations about the company's corporate culture  from an internal investigation from former Attorney General Eric Holder.  </p><p>And a new federal audit showing that Medicare erroneously paid an estimated  $729 million to doctors and other health professionals.  The payments came  under a multibillion-dollar federal initiative to designed shift the health  care system from paper records to computers, the audit found that over  three year period Medicare improperly paid health professionals since that  they bonus payments under the initiative but in reality they either lacked  required proof or they failed to meet the criteria for the bonuses.  </p><p>And then one New Jersey couple had a surprise crasher at their wedding on  Saturday.  President Trump dropped by to congratulate Kristen Piatkowski  and Tucker Gladhill at his Bedminster golf club.  He danced with the bride,  he shook hands with the guests Trump well-known for joining wedding parties  at the resort said he runs, guess he used to run, you may recall back in  February he and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dropped in on a wedding  reception in Mar-a-Lago.  So, you know, get married at the Bedminster in  Jersey and you'll never know who is going to show up, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So far that's pretty cool. </p><p>BLOCKS:  And Donald Trump. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes exactly, and the President of the United States doesn't  drink and so you don't need to worry about him, you know, hitting the open  bar, right?  So maybe the food tables, not the bar, coming up final  thoughts from our all-star panel. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Mitch.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  A big week ahead we got rate hikes, Sessions testimony may be  in public or private and big tech names to watch. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Buckle up, that's what you're saying. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Buckle up. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Michael Block.</p><p>BLOCK:  I'm watching the text docs too, I also want to say happy  anniversary mom and dad Steve and Gloria Block. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How many years?  </p><p>BLOCK:  A lot.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bad son.  But he did wish you a happy anniversary on air.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  The federal reserve is set to raise quarter basis points again  on Wednesday, I'm more interested to see if they hint that unwinding their  balance sheet and reducing some a little the liquidity that helps prop the  markets up. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That we probably won't find out until the fall I think  Septembers the application for that.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA:  Maybe. MCDOWELL:  Thanks to Heather and Michael and Mitch, see you all.  And Maria  will be back tomorrow.  She's going to interview Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin at 7 a.m. Eastern time, and then we go to the U.S. open but right  now it's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

I am Michael Calabrese. I direct the Wireless Future Project at New America's Open Technology Institute and we have a--a great lineup for you. What we had hoped of course to see most of you in person and it is unfortunate of course for so many reasons that we cannot but we wanted to make sure that we took the opportunity to help you know educate the policy community further about this really important issue which we believe is--is coming up to a vote very soon at the FCC and we will hear about that from our--from two of the commissioners momentarily. </p><p>Over the past few years, what many have called the race to 5G has focused primarily on auctioning thousands of megahertz of licensed spectrum in the high-frequency bands, millimeter wave, and now particularly this year in the--in the mid-band range that would be you know C-band spectrum and 2.5 GHz in particular. However, making 5G wireless connectivity and applications available and affordable to all Americans every--everywhere will also depend on opening large new bands of unlicensed spectrum capable of supporting the next generation of gigabit fast Wi-Fi which is--has a new designation Wi-Fi 6 which you will be hearing a lot about. </p><p>Building out mobile carrier 5G will be costly; it will take many years and focus initially on urban and high traffic areas. In contrast, Wi-Fi 6 is--is--is ready now and can make 5G capable connectivity available in any home, business, school, library, or public space that has a--a fiber, cable, or other fast fixed broadband connection nearby. What we need is more spectrum, which is what we will talk about.  </p><p>The problem is that the spectrum bands available for Wi-Fi and unlicensed public use are becoming very congested, particularly in higher traffic areas and insufficient to power 5G-capable apps and services of the near future. The FCC is expected to vote next month on a proposal to allow Wi-Fi 6 to share 1200 MHz of underutilized spectrum across the entire 6 GHz band. This is spectrum you know used for tens of thousands of point to point microwave links and--and other services.  </p><p>The commission has also proposed to reallocate 45 MHz of unused spectrum in the adjacent auto safety band at 5.9 GHz which would create--which will create we hope the first unencumbered gigabit fast Wi-Fi channel there adding onto what has today become the workhorse band for 5G just below the auto safety band. The new unlicensed spectrum is necessary to make Wi-Fi 6 a pillar of a world-leading 5G ecosystem able to provide gigabit fast and affordable capacity needed to connect billions of devices in smart homes, classrooms, public venues and for enterprise IoT networks. </p><p>So with that we will move on to the--the program, the run of show is that we are going to begin with an overview presentation of Wi-Fi 6 and the spectrum it uses by Priscilla Delgado Argeris of Facebook who I will introduce momentarily and then commissioners O'Rielly and Rosenworcel will join me for a discussion and then we will end with a panel which will be led off by John Horrigan from Tech Policy Institute who is going to give overview of the digital divide and then we will have a discussion that also includes Paula Boyd from Microsoft, Rosa Mendoza from Allvanza and AJ Phillips from the Prince William County Public Schools.  </p><p>So with that, I would like to introduce Priscilla, Priscilla Delgado Argeris is the public policy manager for Connectivity and Access at Facebook and the former senior legal advisor to Commissioner Rosenworcel for wireless public safety and international issues. Priscilla? </p><p>DELGADO ARGERIS: Hi, there. I think I have some slides, so I am just going to wait for those to start loading up, but I think you can go to the next slide. You know, thanks everyone for joining. I think Michael asked me to come and do this a couple of weeks ago I never imagined I would be doing it from my house with my kids who are in the next room who we are trying not so successfully yet on the homeschooling and I think all of you are probably working from home, maybe trying to do the same thing.  </p><p>Maybe you are just thinking about the millions of students who don't have access to broadband at home and how they are going to fair over the next weeks and possibly months, but I think it is probably safe to say that Wi-Fi and conductivity and home broadband are all on our minds today. So I just want to talk a little bit more about the importance of Wi-Fi but also the important--the need for more spectrum for Wi-Fi and why the 6 GHz band is going to be so important in meeting that need. So if we can go to the next slide. </p><p>Okay. So I think today it's just becoming so apparent as we are trying to adjust our lives to this current crisis, but Wi-Fi is key to economic growth and to society as a whole. Citizens, businesses, and governments are increasingly relying on Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum. Mobile operators use Wi-Fi extensively to offload traffic from their networks. Wi-Fi drives GDP growth by providing low-cost, high-speed broadband access, and using Wi-Fi also and Wi-Fi to build other technologies, organizations can develop new innovative digital services and business models. And if you look at these graphics, you can see you know the value of Wi-Fi is estimated in 2018 to be $499 billion in the U.S. alone and almost double that is projected, and it tracks the same type of growth globally. </p><p>Next slide. So you know Wi-Fi is an important complement to home broadband, which we all know, but it is also critical; it's going to be a critical complement to 5G. Right now, Wi-Fi supports the offload of 54 percent of mobile data traffic, and this is set to grow to about 70 percent 5G, as you can see. Next slide. </p><p>So Michael mentioned Wi-Fi 6 which is the sort of next-generation Wi-Fi standard, which is ultra-fast, low latency, and Wi-Fi 6 and 5G we expect will work hand in hand because without the ability to offload traffic to Wi-Fi 5G networks will have to be more expensive and less sufficient. Mobile operators would need to invest more in network densification, deploying more small cells in dense urban area in order to get that gigabit throughput. </p><p>Wi-Fi 6 can support 5G use cases such as HD video streaming, Wi-Fi calling, smart home devices, hotspot access, the automation of citywide services, AR/VR application, health monitoring devices, wearables, and seamless roam--roaming. And as we have been talking about, robust Wi-Fi is really critical to bridging the digital divide. I think we are all living this with kids that are switching to distance-learning and you know as Commissioner Rosenworcel, my old boss, has said many times 70 percent of teachers are assigning homework that requires Internet access even in normal circumstances so Wi-Fi is a really important tool for anchor institutions like schools and libraries to close that homework gap for students that don't have reliable home broadband. Next slide. </p><p>So we've talked a lot about why Wi-Fi is important, and we all understand that, but what not everyone is thinking about is that we need more spectrum for Wi-Fi because the current Wi-Fi bands we use are getting congested. As U.S. operators are rolling out this gigabit broadband networks, you have to have really robust Wi-Fi in your home to be able to actually appreciate that to get it to all of your devices, to get it to multiple devices in a household that are streaming at the same time and we don't want Wi-Fi to become a bottleneck to user experience. It has also been more than 20 years since new mid-band spectrum has been made available for Wi-Fi despite this exponential growth in traffic, and unless action is taken, there is estimates that the U.S. is going to have a shortfall of 1.6 GHz by 2025. That will impact businesses and consumers. Next slide. </p><p>So this chart shows the 6 GHz band, and the spectrum that is available and how that spectrum would be divided into channels and what is so important about the 6 GHz band is that it can--if the whole band becomes available for unlicensed use that would mean 760 MHz channels and if you see below, it can show you under different Wi-Fi standards what data rates could be achieved and how fast that could be. Just by comparison, Michael mentioned the 5.9 GHz proceeding which is also super important but the Wi-Fi in that--in that band they're--they're looking to make one 160 MHz new megahertz channel available so to really add a lot of those superfast channels we really need the 6 GHz band. Next slide. </p><p>So in the 6 GHz band industry has been talking about three different device classes and so the first would be a very low--very low power portable device class with a max sort of peak 14 dBm EIRP limit and this would operate both indoors and outdoors. A low-power indoor device class and a standard power device class that would have automated frequency control. Next slide. </p><p>So starting out with VLP these are some of the possible use cases. Mobile AR/VR, UHD video streaming, high-speed tethering, and in-vehicle entertainment. These are you know 2 Gb high throughput and very low latency in close distances. Next slide. </p><p>So in terms of VLP, this is the space where you would have next-generation mobile peripherals, critical 5G use cases like immersive AR/VR connectivity and other advanced peripherals would rely on 6 GHz VLP because of the constraints on battery life, form factor, and cost. And one example would be the connection between augmented reality glasses and a smartphone that would be a VLP device and something that you know we have been talking about at Facebook is that AR/VR really isn't just--I think people think oh, that's gaming or something like that but if you think now that we are all working from home you can imagine you know you do feel that distance even with a video call. Imagine if you had devices in AR/VR that could really make you feel present at work and what that would mean if you could really work from everywhere for any company and so that is something that we are talking a lot about. Next slide. </p><p>Okay. 6 GHz also enables robust low-power indoor use cases, and those are high speeds, 1.4 GHz at a 7 meter distance even if there are obstructions. Next slide. And then standard power use cases. That is like enterprise use cases, 20 GHz per second, outdoor coverage, parks, and stadiums and also there are opportunities for rural connectivity with multi-gigahertz bit point to multipoint services. Next slide. </p><p>Next slide, yeah. Perfect. So obviously the 6 (INAUDIBLE) gigahertz band it is not greenfield spectrum; there are existing users and their important users, but we believe that this unlicensed use can be compatible with those existing incumbents. Low-power indoor and very low power devices protect incumbent operations by design. Low-power and indoor-only low power is indoor only. There would be rules that would require it to be plugged in, there would be removable antennas and couldn't be weatherproofed than that would all ensure that these devices would be used indoors.  </p><p>Very low power, has an extremely low radiant power and dynamic power control and what that means is if you have on you know AR glasses for example if you are in a situation where there was less body loss the power would automatically reduce because you need to save battery life and so you would never have a situation where you are going over the peak power, but this added benefit of dynamic power control that you would have in battery-operated devices also ensure that you are always operating at the lowest power possible. There are other elements in VLP, including body loss, antennae mismatch that would help to prevent any harmful interference to 6 GHz incumbents. </p><p>And then lastly, the standard power 6 GHz devices would protect incumbent operations with automated frequency control. The devices obtain a list of permissible operating frequencies from the AFC system operator. Next slide. </p><p>So, in summary, the U.S. really needs to act on unlicensed spectrum. Wi-Fi is the key to economic growth and societal development, key to achieving the U.S. connectivity goals. It is key to 5G, and it is a key part of bridging the digital divide. Wi-Fi's full potential can only be realized with access to more unlicensed spectrum, and the 6 GHz band is really a perfect fit. The U.S. must act now to ensure 6 GHz spectrum is available on a technology-neutral unlicensed basis as soon as possible. That's it for me. </p><p>CALABRESE: Hello? Thanks, Priscilla, in case that wasn't heard. That was--that was terrific, and if you are able to stay around at the end, in fact, I meant to mention this that we will have a chance for audience questions at the--at the end of the event although I believe the commissioners will be willing to take a couple time permitting.  </p><p>So let's move--let's move on to our discussion with commissioners Mike O'Rielly and Jessica Rosenworcel because we are all anxious to hear from--from you both. You know you don't need any extended introduction except that I would like to both make sure that everyone knows you know how much we appreciate the leadership that both of you have shown for many years in championing a vision of wireless ecosystem that is you know balanced between licensed and unlicensed that has the full powers of both and you have both really lead the way in opening more spectrum at 5.9 GHz and across 6 GHz for the next generation of Wi-Fi that we are here to discuss. So this is really very much part of a culmination of--of all of your efforts for--for years. So I just wanted to--to recognize that. </p><p>So to I guess to get us rolling, what can you tell us about when the commission is likely to adopt the 6 GHz border and also how much additional spectrum capacity can we reasonably expect? </p><p>O'RIELLY: Okay. I guess that is thrown to my direction first.  </p><p>CALABRESE: Sure. </p><p>O'RIELLY: Appreciate (INAUDIBLE) being on the call as well or on--on the video. I was very confident that we were going to see an item very shortly. Next month seemed an appropriate time. I am not sure that events haven't changed that timeline. I haven't had a chance to talk to the chairman, so I'm trying to be respectful. It had been something that was teed up and--and worked with over the last couple of pieces, and I would like to believe that we can still make that happen, but I have to also be mindful that everything else that is happening and be mindful of what type of commission meeting we may have so I--I would like to believe we can still make that momentarily and still be available next month. </p><p>In terms of your second part of your question, how much that is to be worked out. That is something we are working hard on. I have commented in the past about how much I would like to make the whole band available for the three purposes that--that Priscilla mentioned, try and work through all three scenarios that they all be operational, not one over the other. I am certainly mindful low-power indoor is certainly really important to me, but all of them are important and they all have benefits and will really help the community that so needed--needs additional spectrum. </p><p>So I am very happy where things are. I had a chance to Wi-Fi 6e a couple of weeks ago, and I am really excited where things are. There have been proposals, and I am sure we will get into them to do some license in that portion. I haven't find those proposals viable as of yet, but I will keep an open mind. </p><p>CALABRESE: Commissioner Rosenworcel? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: All right. Can you hear me? All right. I cosign and agree with everything my colleague Commissioner O'Rielly just said.  </p><p>For starters, we do need to move fast. The 5G economy is underway, and so much of the focus of our discussion has been on licensed spectrum. It is really important that we think about unlicensed at the same time and the 6 GHz band is a terrific place to do it and just like my colleague I hope we can make as much spectrum available as possible in that band so that we see truly fast speeds and we see as much innovation as we can make possible. So I am hopeful we will get to this in April but I again like my colleague recognize that these are complex times and the agency might need to make some hard decisions, but I do want to thank Commissioner O'Reilly because I know that he has been vigorous in championing that we move on this issue as fast as possible and that is a large part of why we were planning to work on this in April. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Well as a follow-up to what you just said I mentioned at the very opening that what many call the race to 5G has focused almost entirely on--on mobile carrier networks and it's not even clear that many you know I think in this policy community we understand the nuances, but you know the broader context may not be as clear to many on the Hill and in other places. Do you view the next generation of Wi-Fi technology as part of the future 5G wireless ecosystem, and is it complimentary? And I guess Commissioner Rosenworcel can start since you are up. </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: Sure. Sure, absolutely. Listen, I think Priscilla said it really well when she pointed out that 70 percent of 5G traffic is expected at some point to be offloaded onto Wi-Fi networks. So if we don't create more spectrum for Wi-Fi right now what we are going to have is these super-fast licensed networks that are like being on a highway, and then we are going to get off on a gravel road, and it will radically reduce our ability to do new and innovative things at high speeds with low latency so it's key for all of us to keep in mind that statistic that Priscilla offered which is 70 percent of 5G traffic is expected to be offloaded on the Wi-Fi. It's why we've got to think about how we can have more unlicensed spectrum, and we need to do it now. </p><p>O'RIELLY: And I would say I completely view these as complementary and join my colleague's comments and thank her for all of her hard work on these tough issues. We have worked together on a bunch of matters, but these are two particular items both 5.9 and 6 GHz that I have appreciated her--her input, her thoughts, and her hard work on the matter. </p><p>Now to--to your question I--I certainly agree the point in terms of offloading traffic. That--that is a big point, but I just see the change in the communities that the folks that I have been working with for decades on the matter a change of attitude. I certainly believe we are still going to need licensed spectrum, and I work really hard on 5G bands to make those available, but I also believe that we have to have a complementarity full portfolio of unlicensed spectrum and--and that is where you are seeing the licensed community change.  </p><p>In the past, it was a vicious fight between (INAUDIBLE) and now you are seeing an acceptance, but that doesn't mean that that particular band is not going to--you know not going to be contested, but you are seeing and understanding the value from both the licensed community and certainly the unlicensed community. So I think we are going to see you know more appreciation from the licensed community. We are still going to need licensed bands. There is no panacea going forward, and we are still going to have to work really hard, but they all complement each other. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. So and that's a perfect segue to my next question, which is that you know in real-time we're--we're all grappling with school closures in a majority of states including the nation's largest school districts. That could dramatically worsen what Commissioner Rosenworcel has for many years called the homework gap.  </p><p>Would you--would you support the use of emergency funds to pay for Wi-Fi hotspots, waivers of e-rate restrictions, or any other measures that could help families get through the shutdown? Just an opportunity to kind of address the--what is going on you know right now in front of us in terms of the connectivity crunch at home? Commissioner Rosenworcel do you have--(INAUDIBLE) start talking it will switch to you. </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: Yeah, sure. Listen, as a nation, we are heading online like never before. We have got nearly 40 million schoolchildren who have been told that their schools are shuttering, and millions of them have been told to go online for class. This is a huge experiment in remote learning that this crisis has made necessary, but it is also exposing really hard truths about the scope of the digital divide, what I call the homework gap.  </p><p>So many students need Internet access for nightly schoolwork but data from the Senate, from (INAUDIBLE), lots of folks proves time and again that so many students don't have that access and now with everyone expected to work and learn at home we have a crisis on our hands, and I think the FCC should use every emergency power it has to step up and make sure it's e-rate program can cover the cost of Wi-Fi hotspots for loan in our school libraries, so no child is left off-line. </p><p>I think we should mirror our efforts on what was done following Hurricane Katrina during the Bush administration when we made a lot of really big decisions really fast about how we could use our universal service programs to keep folks connected. Now is the time to do exactly the same thing because we can fix this homework gap, but we have got to move fast. </p><p>O'RIELLY: Well, I would say it's--I am incredibly mindful of the circumstances just before me in my own personal life but also talking to the countless people over the years the need to expand broadband accessibility it is paramount priority for me. I have worked really hard in trying to address the unserved population and make sure that the commission stays focused on that to really get broadband to everyone who doesn't have it today and we can--we can disagree over the numbers of how many people are not connected, but we know that that population is significant and whether it's one person or 50 million it doesn't matter to me I want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to--to access the broadband. </p><p>In terms of the immediate crisis that we face, I am willing to look at anything that is available. I know that we don't have the authority to waive the statute. That is something that Congress can do, and I know that they are looking at some of these things and will have the opportunity to consider those--those policy changes. So in--in--in working with my former employers I hopefully will be able to find a policy that works for everyone (INAUDIBLE) very short order. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Any thoughts about you know sort of the add-on to that telework which is becoming at least you know sort of immediately a new normal, and you know could--this could change the degree to which it is done even after this--even after we get through this crisis.  </p><p>There is a very interesting article just today in the New York Times about how there could be you know millions of homes with you know even with good cable Internet where you have two adults trying to do video conferencing for work in addition to children hopefully doing schoolwork, but maybe watching their own video. Now I know you can't wave a magic wand and you know and say that this all this additional unlicensed spectrum is available immediately but--but you know I think it's a good thought experiment that if Wi-Fi 6 and access to the 5.9 and 6 GHz bands were available now, you know with this connectivity crunch be less of a problem? </p><p>That's such a good--that's such a good point. Look, we are in the middle of a crisis right now, and I'd like everyone else wants to get to the other side, and when we do, I hope we take measurements of where our network succeeded and where they failed because it's not simple getting connectivity to everyone's household. You could have challenges with backhaul, with interconnection points, with the last mile and, of course, with our home Wi-Fi systems.  </p><p>In addition, you could have platforms we all use to communicate that might be overloaded. You could also have virtual private networks that enterprise use for telework that really were not made for the load that they are going to have in the coming weeks. So I hope when this is all done, we can look back and identify those points of failure, and I think when we do, we are going to learn that we need more Wi-Fi and the 6 GHz band as a really good place to start. </p><p>CALABRESE: (INAUDIBLE) O'Rielly any thoughts? </p><p>O'RIELLY: I would--I would certainly agree with the points my--my fellow colleague made. I--I might say I would complement it and say we are going to learn a lot of lessons learned will be both positive, and there will be some negative and at any point in the communication network there may be a breakdown because of load and demand, and that is something we will have to explore going forward, and what are those within our authority and others that are--that are outside our report so there will be lessons learned good ones and a lot of up--uplifting will be done from the magical things that the people were able to do during this time, and there will be some sad stories that we will have to deal with that will change policies going forward.  </p><p>So we are going to learn a lot, and we have a lot to do. Wi-Fi will play--is already playing an incredible important role in connecting consumers and enterprises today and in this moment that we live and so I am really appreciative of what has come before me, the work that has come before me, the things that I might have done in a different life and now I know all of the work that we have to do on 5.9 and 6 GHz and those are heavy lifting things. I--I have been there from the beginning, and I am very pleased that we're all getting close to completion. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Well, on a more uplifting note, we have talked about education. What other use cases are you know when we look ahead, what are the use cases are you most excited about as you have been supporting this big increase--increase in unlicensed spectrum capacity you know which could accommodate wide channel gigabit fast Wi-Fi 6 technology? Commissioner Rosenworcel? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: One of the things that I think is most exciting is we are going to see the growth of the intelligent edge. The processing and storing all of the data with centralized cloud or--or data centers is no longer going to be necessary as we moved to this new network infrastructure with Wi-Fi 6 and we are going to push decisions closer to the senses, sensors that are the world around us, to the video cameras, to cars, to all of the devices that are going to be connected and that is going to create a new way of thinking about machine learning, and we are just in the early days of understanding the impact of moving network intelligence to the edge, but I think it's going to be huge. </p><p>O'RIELLY: I would agree, and I appreciate all of the points that Priscilla made in her presentation. One of my old bosses said it well, the beauty of Wi-Fi is you don't know exactly how it's going to be implemented by the innovators, the entrepreneurs, where they are going to exactly take the technology. We have ideas of what may happen in very low-power situations or the low-power indoor or even at the standard power within AFC.  </p><p>We have ideas on what may happen, but we are going to be surprised by something that we weren't anticipating, and that's--that's a wonderful outcome for consumers. There's going to be some--some magical cases coming forward of things that we never thought about in the past and really the synergies that can come from this technology and all three different tracks are really going to be exciting, so I am really interested in seeing this move forward as soon as possible. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay, great. So to a new topic, our panel in a bit, we will focus on the digital divide and Wi-Fi's role in narrowing the gap. I am wondering if--if you are concerned that mobile carrier 5G may be limited initially and for some years to the--to the more you know dense, urban and high traffic areas that justify the high buildout costs you know creating potentially a--a new type 5D--5G digital divide better than closing the divide we have today. I mean, is that a--is that a concern? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: Absolutely. Listen, I mean, it's a fact of nature that our private sector actors are going to choose to deploy first in the areas that are most profitable, and when you build out a network, that is where you start. That is math, that is accounting, that is a law of nature, and we are not going to change it. And then hopefully, we build networks that we can then deploy further and further, but I think policymakers can do things to help ensure that the 5G era reaches us all.  </p><p>We need to be smart about spectrum for one, and I think we have got to make sure that we release to markets for both licensed and unlicensed use, mid-band airwaves that has a nice mix of capacity and propagation because they don't (AUDIO GAP) more unlicensed is available like we are talking about here because that is the lowest-cost way to extend service, it democratizes access, and it is a terrific thing to do not just for innovation but for the economy as a whole. </p><p>O'RIELLY: I--I would join my colleague's comments. I might have lost a little bit in there, but I'm sure she said some wonderful things and I would agree with her on them. But I--like I said I am really excited on what--where--and the places where Wi-Fi can--can fill in its role that it will play. </p><p>I agree that 5G wired--wireless services are probably going to deploy unevenly. We have already seen that with the companies announcing different deployment schedules, many of them in the urban markets to start with. That makes complete sense absolutely. There are things the commission has to do, and Chairman Pai has been very aggressive on the infrastructure side. Commissioner Carr has been working on some of those things, and there's more things that I have called for, and more aggression that we need to be toward some of the barriers in that situation, whether it be state and local or tribal there is some really hard work to do.  </p><p>It's not beloved, I admit. It doesn't make is many as many friends as people would like to say. It does require preemption, and that is hard lifting I acknowledge, but it has to be done, and then on the spectrum side, I agree with my colleague mid-band spectrum has been key. I have been working incredibly hard on C-band, working hard on a number of different bands and then 3.1 to 3.55 a lot of things that are in the pipeline and we also have to build the next pipeline because there's going to be incredible need for new wireless spectrum going forward or spectrum bands that are already allocated for--for many purposes on the government side that are going to need to be converted to the commercial side, and that is a heavy lift as well, and that is what we signed up or.  </p><p>It is what I envisioned the next couple of years will be at the commission. It is going to be hard decision-making and hard to work with our colleagues, but I think we can make some success there. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay, thank you. Let's--let's--let's turn to a debate that has flared up a bit in recent weeks, the Mobile Industry Association, CTIA, has suggested that the top half of this gigahertz band could instead be cleared and auctioned for exclusive use but that would involve moving tens of thousands of--of fixed links, point to point microwave links who are the incumbents and other incumbent users up into the 7 GHz band. Is that feasible or desirable at this--at this point? Commissioner O'Rielly? </p><p>O'RIELLY: Well, I--I alluded to this earlier, and I know we are going to get to--to the question, but I have kept an open mind on this issue and--and I am very mindful that the wireless industry needs more license spectrum, so I have tried to analyze this thoughtfully and look at the different proposals that have been put forward. Here I have said I don't believe at the current time that what the wireless industry has sought, the license community has sought is--is viable and you mentioned 7 GHz.  </p><p>Moving folks from 6 GHz to 7 GHz and I say okay, explain to me is DOD ready for that, are they willing to accept new--new licensees, new neighbors and I haven't seen anything that suggests that as of yet. I--I have also talked to a number of the current incumbents, and I have asked them you know a number of utility companies, and I said, are you interested in moving to 7 GHz? Are you--is this something that would be of--of interest to you and--and quite frankly I think they are--you know the initial story, the initial take is they are more interested in working with the unlicensed community to make Wi-Fi 6 acceptable, Wi-Fi 6e operational. </p><p>So that--that is my initial take on the situation. I will continue to hear the dialogue on this, and if something changes I--I will want to reconsider but the viability of that plan is not exactly fulsome at the current time. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Commissioner Rosenworcel, anything on this? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: Well, I--I agree with my colleague. I think he stated it very well. If speed is your primary goal here that we get more unlicensed spectrum to the market, then we've got to recognize that relocating the incumbents in the 6 GHz band is a project that could take as much as ten years according to our history whereas with unlicensed we can figure out ways to (INAUDIBLE) coordination and having low-power where we can accommodate existing uses and get this into Wi-Fi 6 fast.  </p><p>So my--my concern is that setting aside a chunk of these airways for licensed spectrum would be a slow process and in the marketplace, we wouldn't be able to use them for what could be many years. In addition, I think it would put us at odds with some of the efforts going around nation--around the world where at least the lower portion of this band being looked at in Europe (INAUDIBLE) unlicensed spectrum and we would of course benefit from harmonizing and building it because (INAUDIBLE) devices where our use cases or our use of that spectrum for unlicensed is similar. </p><p>CALABRESE: Right. I believe it was at the WRC primarily Huawei and China that was you know pushing for us even to look at potentially licensing in the upper 6 GHz. </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: Right. Yeah, no, I think it was purchased by China, for I think it is region two which involves Europe and Africa to study the use of this band for licensed airwaves at the next ITU gathering, which could be 2023. In other words, that is a long way out. I like the idea of us using these airwaves for unlicensed and finding a way to do it fast, and that is why I think moving ahead in the 6 GHz band in the next few months is so important. </p><p>O'RIELLY: I agree with my colleague and say you know I had the chance to be in Egypt for the WRC and I will tell you, you know, my experience where those countries to disrupt U.S. Wi-Fi experiences and to slow our success globally and then disrupt that process those companies you mentioned, the countries you mentioned are more disruptive than it was about strategic actually licensing and being thoughtful going forward. So I found the process very distasteful (INAUDIBLE) hold WRC and--and it has made it problematic going forward. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, that is interesting. So Priscilla described three general categories of--of Wi-Fi 6 outdoor use at standard power that would be controlled by the database or any standard power use would have to be database controlled to protect incumbents but also low-power--lower power indoor only and very low-power for you know peripherals like headsets or glasses with AR/VR, etc. Do you think the commission will be able to accommodate all of--you know all three categories of use case? </p><p>O'RIELLY: I--I will take that to start as I don't see my colleague right at the moment. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, go ahead. </p><p>O'RIELLY: So I think that all three tracks are necessary and I think that I--I appreciate the--the license community working together and not fighting amongst each other to try and make one track over another track, so I think all three are--are necessary and inevitable and will be part of our item whenever it is considered.  </p><p>I think it has to be there--there are different services that can come from them and--and the benefits from each one we--we are getting to see, but there is no one right mode. I would say the only thing on the AFC side is I am hopeful that an AFC will be a little scaled-down, not as extensive as the SaaS structure that we have at 3.5. I would like (INAUDIBLE) could do a little less comprehensive. I would like to believe that is the case. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, I think that's the general belief. Commissioner? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: I agree. I think my colleague said it well. I would also like to see low-power indoor use throughout the bands; our initial proposal was that only two bands would be eligible for that and I think we could move faster and build a bigger ecosystem for the 6 GHz band if we allow low-power indoor use across the entire 6 GHz band. </p><p>O'RIELLY: You are absolutely right. And we are you know that--that's why you get seven channels, and so I think that is something that is incredibly high priority for the chairman and myself and I think that is hopefully where we are going to land. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, well, we are, of course, pleased to hear that since our very broad-based you know consumer civil rights education etc. coalitions have made that our--our top priority for the general public. So you know building on this I will ask commissioner--well, both of you but Commissioner O'Rielly I guess to start. So on the AFC, right, at--at standard Wi-Fi power levels there seems to be a consensus that the commission should require an automated frequency coordination system to control access and ensure no harmful interference to the thousands of fixed links. So database sharing I mean in--in some ways this has been a bit of a surprise because database sharing was so controversial just a few years ago why isn't this dynamic sharing more controversial in this proceeding? </p><p>O'RIELLY: Well, my take would be that we have--we have greater experience, right? We have done you know (INAUDIBLE) has worked to address a number of problems that we had on (INAUDIBLE) white spaces. We have done extensive work on 3.5 to make the SaaS and ESCs operational and bring them up to speed. And so I think the experience has really calmed down a lot of the waters from incumbent users from DOD and other--others and so I think an AFC makes--makes incredible sense for the certain power level that we are talking about, the track that we are talking about, the one track of the three in--in 6 GHZ.  </p><p>But I think it is also mindful that we not overload that, that we not expect that doesn't necessarily have to be a full some SaaS-type structure that we can build a less requirement and not burdensome not be as expensive as--as we have had in the past. So experience has helped us a lot, experience on both sides right and making sure that it's not too cumbersome in the process. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Commissioner Rosenworcel? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: I--I agree with my colleague again. Like pause and remember it wasn't that long ago that it was perceived as totally radical to have a spectrum access system, and these things would never work, but here we are, and we have got proof of concept. We are demonstrating the possibilities in white spaces and in the 3.5 GHz band and the best news yet is I think we can do it with a simpler system in the 6 GHz band and I think what we are going to do over the long haul is use more of these systems in more spectrum bands going forward because what we can do is we can take existing use cases and expand them, and we can move what we thought of as scarcity into abundance, and that is really exciting and the fact that we have now gotten used to the idea that we might be using systems like these in more of our airways it is really important. Like you said, it is almost revolutionary switch in our thinking, and it is passing us by, but we should pause and note it is really important that it has happened. </p><p>CALABRESE: And--and I would like to add you know I think to your credit that the FCC is the again leading the world on this. You know Commissioner O'Rielly mentioned that the European Union and the United Kingdom they are both about equally far along in opening you know the 500 MHz at the bottom of 6 GHz 5925, 6425 for unlicensed sharing with fixed links but they--they are doing it initially indoor-only because they have no experience with using automated frequency coordination. And similarly they are starting to open C-band spectrum for sharing for small enterprise use and so on but again they are doing it through manual coordination which is very clunky and limiting because they have no experience with this sort of leading-edge use of dynamic database coordination that we have in the U.S. </p><p>So again I--you know I think you should take some credit for leading the world on this. It is going to be really important. I think in the--in 5--in the whole broader 5G ecosystem. </p><p>O'RIELLY: (INAUDIBLE) mindful that it is not just this commission, it is folks that were lot working on this for a long while before I got to the commission. I give credit to my colleague Commissioner Rosenworcel for working on this before I was there, and Tom (INAUDIBLE) worked on it hard when he was chair so it has been a long, long lot of work done.  </p><p>I will say that I visited the UK last summer and talked about some of these things and they do have somewhat different path than mine. I didn't exactly figure out some of the things. I didn't exactly agree with where they were going on some of the C-band things, for instance, but you know they were not exactly taking my--my ideas either. So we will just have to see who--who is right going forward. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Well, we are almost out of time, but I do want to ask the last question on my end about the 5.9 GHz band. You know comments were just filed on that last week. One argument we are seeing from the auto industry is that reallocating 45 MHz to unlicensed and Wi-Fi is just a small increment. It is not needed considering the far larger amounts that could soon be available at 6 GHz. So I am wondering how you think about that. I mean, you both made 5.9 a priority. Is it really just a marginal 40 or 45 MHz, or is it something more important? Commissioner O'Rielly? </p><p>O'RIELLY: Well, look, at 5.9 incredibly important. I disagree with some of the auto industry, and I wouldn't say it's the car manufacturers who have switched their tune over the last many years and so I think the infrastructure side is still you know committed to a DS RC model, and all 75 MHz must be preserved. I don't think it is sustainable going forward, and I think that their approach is problematic. They have been you know so much hyperbole on this subject it is incredibly not helpful to the entire dialogue. </p><p>But I think what you get from 5.9 is not something that is identical to a 6 GHz though they are really close and we can put 5.9 to work immediately. There would be more work needed to make the AFC operational and 6 GHz to deal with some of the things so notwithstanding adopting an item there will be more work to have 6--to make 6 GHz operational where we can plug in 5.9 almost immediate and so I think that is really telling and something that I think the auto industry as a whole or the transportation industry as a whole is missing on the situation. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Commissioner? </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: I think my colleague just said that very well, but I--I think there's a bigger macro issue here. Two years ago, in appropriations legislation Congress asked the FCC to find 255 MHz of spectrum, and as much of that would be 155 MHz below 8 GHz for unlicensed use.  </p><p>So, on the one hand, we have Congress tasking us with identifying airwaves that can be cleared for unlicensed use and a lot of them, and that is a great thing. They understand just as Priscilla mentioned that this is big for the economy; let's have more of it, but at the same time, we have a lot of federal entities that are incumbent users in 8 gig and below 8 GHz and they are pushing back on the agency whenever we try to reclaim those airwaves or even try to come up with waves where we can use them together, and this is not a problem that is unique to this administration. </p><p>Frankly, it is as old as time, and on a going-forward basis for us to have a robust wireless economy with both licensed and unlicensed, we are going to have to get better at this because the back and forth slows down what we can do with these airwaves and slows down innovation and I think we are going to reach the point where it slows the economy too.  </p><p>So this is a bigger picture problem than just what we see in the 5.9 GHz band. It is something that we are going to have to address at a higher level because this back and forth isn't getting us always the airwaves we need. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Thank you. Well, I had promised to wrap up with you all by--by one so I think we have to--we will have to end it here but I want to thank you again for--for joining us under these unusual circumstances, and we are still learning how to do this by in--in virtual terms, but I think it you know went very well. So thank you to all and here's a lot of virtual applause for you from our-- </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: Thank you, Michael-- </p><p>CALABRESE: --from our audience. </p><p>ROSENWORCEL: --and thank you New America, and thank you to everyone who is working hard at home right now using their home Wi-Fi or trying to manage keeping their kids quiet while we do these kind of things. I know personally, it is not easy, and just want to thank you for keeping this going and having this discussion today. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Thank you. </p><p>O'RIELLY: My thanks to everyone. Have--have a happy Saint Patty's Day. As best you can stay safe. Thanks so much. </p><p>CALABRESE: That's right. Thank you, commissioners. That is something I forgot to do at the outset is wish everyone a happy St. Patrick's Day. It is so hard to remember when you are not seeing anyone dressed in green, although I should since I am half Irish believe it or not in spite of my last name. </p><p>So we can move on to well, soon to our panel, but as a sort of a kind of an introduction or set up for our panel, I would like to introduce John Horrigan. John is a senior fellow at the--at the Technology Policy Institute where he focuses on technology adoption and digital inclusion. Dr. Horrigan is also a senior advisor to the Urban Libraries Council, so John, take it away. </p><p>HORRIGAN: Great. Thank you very much to everyone. I have a few slides that I think are going to get loaded and displayed in a minute. That is slide number one. We can go to the next slide, and what I want to do is offer a fairly high-level portrait of where we stand when it comes to the digital divide. What my focus is going to be is on internet adoption at home so my presentation will not get into the deployment issue, meaning I won't get into whether people's home broadband speed meet the 25 megabits per second threshold or not I'm just going to focus on what we know about how people or whether people are subscribing to broadband at home. </p><p>So in addition to this being St. Patrick's Day it also marks the 10th anniversary of the delivery of the National Broadband Plan to Congress and one of the things that is an outgrowth of a lot of the policy activity of that era is that the American community survey started in 2013 asking questions and it surveys about people's technology use at home. So that has become an incredibly rich data source on what is going on with respect to the digital divide in so far as we can now understand who is subscribing to broadband at home, who is not and even get down to the regional and city level to look at broadband adoption in those contexts. </p><p>I am going to keep it at the 30,000-foot level and just focus in this first slide on figures from the American community survey that focus on broadband of any type and the percentage of people with broadband of any type at home, and you can see over the 2013 to 2018 timeframe we have had a steady increase in the share of people with broadband of any type at home. We have gone from about 73 percent in 2013 to 85.1 percent in 2018. Let's go to the next slide, please. </p><p>On this next slide, we focus on American community survey data of--that takes a different slice at who has broadband at home. In 2016 the ACS started asking a question about whether people have broadband at home such as cable modem, digital subscriber line service, or fiber-optic service. That is a question that essentially captures the percent of people with a wireline broadband subscription at home, and you can see that the numbers are very different than when you focus on overall broadband adoption rates. </p><p>If you look at the 2018 number on the right, we see that 69--69.6 percent of households have a wireline broadband subscription at home. If you can remember back one slide prior, you will recall that in 2018 85.1 percent of Americans had broadband of any type, so you have that roughly 15 percentage point gap between people having broadband of any type versus a wireline broadband subscription at home. For the most part, that 15 percentage point gap is the smartphone, people who have a cellular data plan but do not have a broadband Internet subscription at home. </p><p>Now that gap is important because it is a measure of digital inequality. There's been a number of research undertakings, one of the most important most recently is from the Michigan State University, who show that having smartphone only internet access is insufficient for completing a number of different tasks online. The Michigan State research, in particular, households who are smartphone only have students in them who are struggling to complete homework, have lower levels of digital skills are less likely to take the SAT relative to those households with a wireline Internet subscription at home.  </p><p>So the focus on the wire line subscription I think is an important metric for policymakers to focus on and we in turn translate that 69.6 percent figure into households. That means that as of 2018 in the United States, we had nearly 37 million households without a wireline broadband Internet subscription at home. And as I think many of us can appreciate, that wireline subscription is the pipe off of which so much of our Internet experience depends and it's where wireline ends and for my most households Wi-Fi begins.  </p><p>Next slide, please. And Commissioner Rosenworcel set up a nice analogy that I'm going to play off of for this slide. As she pointed out how some households have super-fast Highway running to their homes and then with Wi-Fi that may not perform so well, they get off onto a gravel road. Well, this first data point from Deloitte survey shows that the average household has 11 wireless connected devices.  </p><p>So there's a lot of cars on that gravel road relying on Wi-Fi for their Internet access experience and as the tool by which they use the various applications on these wireless devices. The Deloitte reports didn't break out how many low income households have connected devices relative to well off ones, but when you have an average of 11 wireless connected devices, it means that even low income households have a number of wireless connected devices sharing that Wi-Fi Internet connection at home.  </p><p>And in fact, according to a survey I did and in 2018 of low income households, and this was a sample of Comcast Internet essentials customers who had come within the prior three months, gotten a home broadband subscription, we asked them what kind of devices they had, what kind of things they do with their home broadband subscription. We found that 82 percent had smart phones, 59 percent streamed TV or video to their devices, 57 percent had a desktop or laptop, 53 percent have a tablet. So low income households have lots of wireless devices.  </p><p>I should point out also that the 59 percent number for streaming TV and video, obviously that does include entertainment, but we also found in that survey which did have an oversample of low income households with children. That survey did find that there was a lot of streaming going on for educational purposes in those households. </p><p>Let's turn for a second to Wi-Fi in community anchor institutions and, in particular, libraries. What I did at the Pew Research Center a couple of years back focused on how consumers will help patrons experienced various technology experiences at the local public library and we found that 29 percent of public libraries patrons use the library or Wi-Fi resources at the local public library. That was most prevalent among young people and low-income people and there was a high rate of people using Wi-Fi or other competing devices at libraries for schoolwork, research, and for healthcare applications. </p><p>I want also mentioned some work I've done looking at public libraries in California in the State of California several years ago, public libraries were able to access the Phoenix Research Network in the state, which is very high-speed Internet connection that runs to public libraries. This increased the access speeds available at public libraries from something like 76 megabits per second to 2 gigabits per second or more. So libraries were going from been with scarcity to been with abundance overnight in some cases and libraries had eight to consider what to do with this new wealth of bandwidth.  </p><p>Lots of libraries started interesting programs on gaming in there--to bring people to libraries in their community to do gaming. They used their bandwidth for programs to import cultural content from some of the state's excellent cultural institutions like the Exploratorium or the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. So libraries started to close what we identified as a sort of this bandwidth imagination gap by using bandwidth for some of the services I just described but also relying on Wi-Fi within their libraries to really deliver those services.  </p><p>So libraries in California at least, and I'm sure this is going on in other places around the country, are seeing sometimes very significant upgrades in connection speeds. They also need the next step, which is to have the Wi-Fi within their institutions to really get the most bang for the bandwidth buck that they're getting.  </p><p>Next slide, please. And this will just be by way of wrapping up to talk about some of the implications of this. For a lot of people, the last few feet is as important as the last mile to their households. This is true in particular for all income categories. Wi-Fi 6 is part of another tech transition but we have to make sure that the capacity exists to serve all segments of society. </p><p>So there's an imperative and we're seeing it obviously very vividly in these recent days with people having to stay-at-home due to the pandemic to work on the problem of home wireline broadband connectivity to lots of low income Americans in particular, but then also plan for the future with a Wi-Fi experience that will make--enable people to get the most out of the bandwidth that we have at home. So with that, I will wrap up, Michael, and to turn it over to you. </p><p>CALABRESE: Thanks, John. That's--yeah, that was terrific background and I think, you know, for me at least particularly reinforced--I wasn't aware that scenic (SP), the California libraries in scenic example, but it really dramatizes that, you know, you can have--you can bring multi-gigabit, you know, fiber to a community anchor institution library, school, but if you can't distributed to all the devices, to all the people and, you know, you're really not making the most of it. And with 5G applications, we'll only get bandwidth intense, obviously AR, VR, the things that Priscilla outlined for us earlier.  </p><p>So let's move--move on then to include the rest of our--our panel and I'll just introduce each one in turn for, you know, just kind of a few minutes of, you know, their perspective on, you know, why are they in their organization so engaged on this--on this issue, why is it important. So first we have Paula Boyd, who is the--who is the senior director for government and regulatory affairs at Microsoft.  </p><p>And Paula, I want to, you know, I think ask you about--about Microsoft's interest in this because Microsoft has been such a leading advocate for license for more than a decade and has been advocating for more unlicensed in low, mid, and high band spectrum, all of it. Why is this such a priority for the company and how it is Wi-Fi 6 fit into your vision? </p><p>BOYD: Sure. Michael, thank you so much for the opportunity to participate on the panel. You know, as you mentioned, we have been--Microsoft has been involved in broadband discussions for a really long time. You know, when I think about sort of the journey that Microsoft and other companies have had from a technology perspective, unlike some of the other big tech companies, we were kind of born off-line.  </p><p>You know, we, you know, I remember the days when, you know, I got my software on a floppy disk and you had to download it to the computer. But over the years, you know, everything has shifted to being online. You know, so your email is in the cloud, your productivity tools today are in the cloud, you know, we are leveraging the cloud to--to enable this, you know, this--this discussion.  </p><p>And with that, you know, in addition to the--our services that actually leverage the cloud, like Office 365, you know, Outlook.com, and other services, were also a cloud service provider, which means that we host services from other third parties in our cloud and allow their users, customers, employees to access their content and services online. And so for us, broadband is critical for--to that. Without broadband, there is no access to the cloud, there's no access to all of the services.  </p><p>And so from our perspective, you know, we have always--we have been very involved in the broadband discussion for--for some time. As we, you know, in addition to sort of the policy efforts around broadband, we've also taken the opportunity a couple years back to stand up our Airband initiative, in which we pledged to connect, I believe it's two million users unserved--sorry. We pledged to partner with broadband providers to connect consumer--to provide coverage, broadband coverage for consumers who don't have it today, at least consumers in rural areas.  </p><p>And you know, we been working--our project, our team, Airband team has been working really hard on those issues and those project deployments and, you know, today, you know, they have commercial projects in about 26 states, including Puerto Rico. And--and so they're will underway--on their way to delivering on that pledge. So we--we care about it from a policy perspective, we care about it from just getting, you know, our hands, you know, into kind of the project aside and working with partners to deliver on it.  </p><p>I think that 6--the 5G opportunity is really interesting and I think it intersects really nicely with, you know, highlighting the importance of ensuring that unlicensed spectrum is allocated across the 6 gigahertz band. You know, 5G, you know, will mean greater band, you know, applications with--with greater bandwidth or--or with greater bandwidth needs. It will mean low latency.  </p><p>And today, you know, we are--it's been amazing at least from my perspective what we have seen Wi-Fi do in other bands, be it 2.4, be it in 5 gigahertz. But we know those channel sizes are--are a little smaller at least in 2.4 gigahertz and we just know that those--those bands are becoming increasingly crowded.  </p><p>So if--if we want to keep up with being able to leverage Wi-Fi just in our daily life, I mean, you know, sitting here and connecting via Wi-Fi today. In order to keep up with that and to have new experiences as those experiences unfold with 5G and other technologies, it's going to be critical to ensure that unlicensed spectrum is allocated across those 6 gigahertz band. </p><p>CALABRESE: Great. Thanks, Paula. We were also joined by AJ Phillips who is the director of information technology services for the Prince William County Public Schools. And so I'd like to ask AJ just to, you know, talk bit about why is Wi-Fi important to teaching and learning in your school district and, you know, is that a changing thing? </p><p>PHILLIPS: Hi, Michael. Thank you very much. I appreciate you having me here today. So you know, Prince William County Schools is a large school district. We are the second largest in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and we have 91,000 students. So every day, I'm thinking about instructionally how we support their students with Wi-Fi, with, you know, our network, ensuring that its functioning, and I think our greatest struggle is that while 5G and Wi-Fi 6 are all awesome things that are coming, school districts struggle with getting their equipment up-to-date to pay for these types of things, right?  </p><p>And so what I'm always focusing on is, you know, students coming with more than one device to school. I mean, right now, I'm sitting here with my iPad up, my phone going, and my laptop, right? Kids are coming with those same types of things, and so being able to support that kind of instruction on a daily basis for 100 different locations and 91,000 students is a challenge. And so not only that, we have voice over IP, you know, we have security cameras running on the network. Robotics, online learning. You know, obviously the school closure is a huge part of it too. We have students trying to get onto, you know, VPN into the network and staff working.  </p><p>So you know, this change to go to Wi-Fi 6 and the 5G would be immensely important for the school divisions across the United States. I mean, you got to think about other things just outside of the instructional piece. Our schools are trying to show--have Wi-Fi at the stadium so parents who are may be deployed overseas can see their kids playing sports. And so we need that Wi-Fi access at the stadiums.  </p><p>Also, when parents come to pay, they go to the concession stand. They wanted to be able to swipe the card. Well, we need Wi-Fi for that. So this is huge, a huge game changer for Prince William County schools, for schools across the division. I think one of our greatest challenges there will be once--if and when we get to Wi-Fi 6 and 5G, the challenge would be us as a division being able to fund those, up to upgrade our equipment to be able to max that speed--match that speed. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. Thanks, AJ. And our final panelist is Rosa Mendoza who is the founder, president, and CEO of Allvanza. So Rosa, can--can you tell us about Allvanza's mission and how Wi-Fi and affordable access impacts the communities that you advocate for? </p><p>MENDOZA: Good afternoon, everyone. And first of all, thank you, Michael, and the Open Tech Institute for inviting me to take part on this important dialogue in the future Wi-Fi. Look, Allvanza's mission is to advocate to ensure everyone, especially those from underserved immunities has a chance to succeed in our innovation and technology-based society.  </p><p>I created Allvanza for many reasons, but one of the reasons is because Latinos continue to be on the wrong side of the digital divide. And although research has shown that Latinos use smartphones more than other groups of Americans, as John Horrigan had mentioned during his presentation, we need to remember that there's only so much you can do on a smart phone. So we need broadband access on effectual devices, we need them where one lives, where one works in order to fully benefit from the many crucial resources available online.  </p><p>And one of the many reasons why we at Allvanza care about Wi-Fi is because it represents at major mechanism to help close the digital divide. And because for too many people in the Latino community, Wi-Fi represents their only way to access the Internet. And you know, research has also shown that minorities use Wi-Fi more often than their white counterparts. And they do it for many reasons. I mean, education purpose--purposes, job searches, entertainment, and so on.  </p><p>And another important fact that research has also shown is that the number of devices that connect to Wi-Fi continues to increase, and that's not going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, I just wrote a blog on this issue in one of the statistics that I referenced in that blog is that some estimates suggest that by 2022, there will be more than 13 Internet enabled devices per person in the U.S. And of course, many of which will be able to connect--or will connect to their Wi-Fi. Excuse me. </p><p>And speaking of devices, you know, that connect to Wi-Fi, my son who, by the way, is only two and a half years old, already has an iPad. And of course, that wife iPad connects via Wi-Fi, right? I guess we just have 12 more to go. Twelve more devices to go given the statistics, right? So look, we all very much rely on this very valuable resource and thus why it's very, very important that additional mid-band spectrum is allocated for (INAUDIBLE) use in order to facilitate increased Wi-Fi availability.  </p><p>Without access to reliable, affordable, you know, Internet broadband on effectual devices, like I said, where one lives, where one works, Latinos and other underserved communities are going to continue finding themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. So affordable, reliable broadband access is truly the cornerstone for underserved communities achievement and success in our modern society that we all know has become very much dependent on innovation and technology. And as I mentioned, Allvanza advocates for this essential and what we believe should be a fundamental right for all people living in the U.S. </p><p>CALABRESE: All right. Thanks, Rosa. I wanted to pick up on, you know, this question of a potential 5G digital divide. As a--as mobile carriers, build out 5G, the promised gigabit speeds and low latency are expected to--to generate valuable new apps and services as much as 4G made Uber, Lyft, and live video streaming possible.  </p><p>Should we be concerned, you know, that for many years, 5G may be limited to the more profitable, urban, and high-traffic areas, as Commissioner Rosenworcel was saying, creating potentially a new 5G digital divide rather than closing the divide we have today? So this is really for any of you. Is that a, you know, is that something we should be concerned about? </p><p>MENDOZA: This is Rosa. I think that in order to ensure that 5G does not make the digital divide worse, it is obviously really important that 5G is deployed in every community in the U.S. to ensure that everyone can benefit from emerging technology that obviously in enriches our lives in countless ways. But another thing that we need to think about is that, and this is something that we don't discuss often, 5G infrastructure will create a lot of job opportunities.  </p><p>But unfortunately, a lot of people in underserved communities do not know about these opportunities and they have no clue what to do, what certifications to get in order for them to be able to get these jobs. So it's very important that the companies that are deploying and will be deploying 5G create some sort of roadmap that can educate people about how to get jobs and deploy an 5G infrastructure because people in our community need to know what type of skills they need, what, you know, if they need some sort of specialized training and certifications, et cetera.  </p><p>And not only do they need to hear about these services, but the need to take advantage of these opportunities. And like I said, in order to ensure that everyone benefits from these emerging technologies, 5G does need to be deployed in every community in as many communities as possible, of course. </p><p>PHILLIPS: I have to say, I think it will be a challenge and it could create a little bit of divide because we currently still do have areas, you know, even where I live next to Prince William County. I live in Fauquier County where my daughter, you know, goes to school and there--and my--and my--I don't even live in a neighborhood. I live on the gravel road that John had mentioned, right, that you pull off of. We don't have Internet. I don't have cable coming out here. I'm using literally a hotspot right now from home.  </p><p>And so what I am afraid is that that 5G is not going to work out 4G or anything else to work out here. So that's always a concern for me and for my students who live--I border right on Prince William County. I have students in my school district the live out here and they don't have Internet access. So that is a concern from a tech director's point of view and an educator that could cause more of the divide. </p><p>BOYD: So this is Paula. I'll--I'll also go ahead and jump in as well. I thought Commissioner Rosenworcel said it really well. You know, if--if the past is instructive, these networks are challenging to build out and buildout often happens in areas that are non-rural first. We're at the sort of high density areas.  </p><p>But, you know, we know that and so my hope is that we can be intentional about anticipating the challenges for building out elsewhere and--and putting in place, you know, private public sector opportunities to ensure that connectivity is--is extended to everyone. It's important, you know, that 5G is filled out. I think it's just a matter of making sure that we are intentional about the gaps that might arise as that buildout occurs. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. </p><p>HORRIGAN: And if I might add quickly, Michael, I think the other point I mentioned about the 37 million household gap in wireline broadband adoption at home I think is worth keeping in mind in the context of 5G, which is to say there are two interrelated problems to solve deploying 5G, but also tackling that home wireline broadband adoption gap that is particularly concentrated not just in rural area, although there are problems obviously there, but it's located in low income, urban areas and in communities of color in particular. So there are multiple problems we have to address as we move along this path toward 5G. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah. Thanks, John. Yeah, and that's--that's certainly bright because you--when you mentioned that, I think it's a very sobering statistic to is not only that overall gap in, you know, in fixed connections, but the idea that even, you know, that 15 percent that is mobile only, you know, they're not getting the full functionality of, you know, of fast broadband. And--and if they try to rely on--on mobile--on their smartphones, no matter how fast does get, it's not going to really give them the full opportunity of Internet access.  </p><p>So kind of turning to education in particular, so even before the current school closures, an estimated one third of K-12 students had inadequate home broadband. You know, so what, you know, Commissioner Rosenworcel calls the homework gap could now be, you know, a much bigger learning gap for as long as this goes on. What role can Wi-Fi play perhaps coupled with other policies to help students without good Internet connectivity at home? So maybe start with AJ and--and others can chime in. </p><p>PHILLIPS: Sure. Yeah, I mean the homework and gap was definitely concerned before we are in the current situation wherein with COVID-19. You know, definitely in Prince William County, we--we have mountains on one side and, you know, we are--were next to DC on the other side and we have those urban areas in those rural areas where kids do not have Wi-Fi access. And it's a challenge and so right now, we are really struggling with trying to ensure that instruction continues in these unprecedented times and we're struggling with it.  </p><p>We really do not have the capacity to provide the Internet that they need. You know, and some families just can't afford it, right? They can't--Comcast, you know, even in a variety of other different providers, you know, lower the costs but they, you know, parents will say all the time, well, we have a cell phone.  </p><p>And like you said, Michael, we can't continue to rely on the cell phone for our instruction and education. There--they need more to--to their education and--and so that is a great challenge. And a lot of our school district, they just don't have access, and so we are concerned. We--we been contacting numerous vendors saying hey, can we get some hotspots and see if they'll work in the various areas?  </p><p>And at this point, with the coronavirus going on, hotspots from the carriers are hard to find. You know, they're saying well, we had might have some next week. We're okay. Well, that's good, but you know, and then it's trying to get them out there and make sure they work and show the families how to use them. So at this time, it's becoming wider for us in Prince William County schools, the homework gap. </p><p>BOYD: Yeah, and I'll go ahead and jump in as well, Michael. You know, it's--it's certainly, you know, it's certainly a challenge, but you know, I think Wi-Fi has an opportunity to provide some help. I mean, we talked about--AJ talked about hotspots. You know, one of the things that we kind of learned when we did our--and Airband pilot in Southern Virginia is in the pilot, we leveraged the Wi-Fi. We leveraged the connectivity at the school to push out connectivity to homes--students in their homes. </p><p>And, you know, when we partner with our partners, they use a lot of different kinds of spectrum to enable connectivity and a lot of that is unlicensed spectrum, like 2.4 or 5 gigahertz. And we--we think there--there are opportunities there. You know, there's--there's stuff that's done around the E-rate to make connectivity in the schools available and our hope is that, you know, one of the things that we've asked the FCC to do in the past is to enable schools to--to make it clear that schools can use their E-rate funded broadband connectivity to connect students in the home. Some of that can be done with unlicensed spectrum, including Wi-Fi.  </p><p>So we think there's--there's--it's a tremendous tool simply because there are no barriers to being able to leverage it unlicensed spectrum and Wi-Fi, so our hope is, you know, it's a really difficult time for a lot of schools right now. Our hope is that, you know, a lot of these ideas will bear fruit and folks will see value in enabling these solutions at time--you know, when we're not in the crisis mode that will last beyond this crisis and will be prepared if there's ever, you know, happens again. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah. Yeah, well hopefully, that will--they will loosen some of the restrictions for--on E-rate funding, for example. You know, I'm--because I think about, you know, not only your pilot, but also in the library space, that gigabit library's network has a pilot that was--has different federal funding, which uses unlicensed spectrum in the TV bands, the TV white space to extend connectivity from the library out, you know, further into the community because, you know, you may have a fast pipe to the library, but at best, you know, you know, given the hours at a library sitting in the parking lot may be the only way to use it otherwise and it can be extended further and schools could be doing some of that as well. </p><p>BOYD: Yeah. </p><p>CALABRESE: Let me ask I think AJ in particular, you mentioned that, you know, so let's assume, okay, let's--were going to be talking about the home, our back at school, you mentioned that schools will need more and more bandwidth for Wi-Fi. Does this reflect changes in how Internet access is used in teaching and learning? So for example, are you expecting more use of very high bandwidth applications such as virtual reality? </p><p>PHILLIPS: Yeah. So being a former educator and now a tech director, you know, I look at things and go, okay, we need to prepare our students for their future and not ours. And so there's going to be two jobs in the future. One--one is going to be working with computers and the other one is going to be fixing computers.  </p><p>And so we have to enable our students to be able to have those devices and those learning opportunities to be prepared for those jobs. And the only way we can do that is by increasing the bandwidth and ensuring that we have enough bandwidth and Wi-Fi to be able to support them.  </p><p>I do see we are already are--our teachers, our principals are already asking me hey, we need more--we need more bandwidth. We want to do, you know, virtual reality. We're going on these virtual field trips. We want to, you know, check with, you know, an author and things like that. And so, you know, with the bandwidth, with the division as large as ours, our bandwidth gets eaten up quickly with everybody streaming and different variety of things and creating their YouTube videos and doing morning announcements.  </p><p>And so I always equate it to the Field of Dreams. If I build it, they will come. And so over the past couple of years, with gaunt--we've increased our network and the more I'm adding, the more that I see that they are utilizing it. And no, were not at our backs, but we're getting there to the point where next year and thinking, okay, I already need to start adding on more bandwidth to--to enable our students and our teachers to be able to get the instruction across that they need to prepare them for their future jobs. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, that's right. And if--if 5G networks make augmented reality and virtual reality something, you know, more commonplace and more affordable, I mean, that will--I'm sure that will become a tool in the schools as well. </p><p>PHILLIPS: It will be a game changer. Yeah, absolutely. </p><p>CALABRESE: Any other thoughts on that in schools, libraries, education? Because I'd like to go on and circle back to Rosa. Rosa, you mentioned that Wi-Fi impacts everyone in so many important aspects of life in your community. Can you give us, you know, some other example, some specific examples of where Wi-Fi is going to be very important? </p><p>MENDOZA: Absolutely. I have several samples that I'm going to share with you. But I want to start with a question, and this question is, I guess, who for whoever can unmute themselves and say I do. So the question is does your current laptop has an ethernet port? I'm sure nobody is going to respond because mine doesn't. I can't remember the last time my device had an ethernet port.  </p><p>And look, the point is that access to Wi-Fi is really the only way many people access the Internet and that's why having increased Wi-Fi options through opening up unlicensed spectrum is very important to those who already have limited access and those who struggle with adopting any resources. And obviously referring to people from underserved communities, right?  </p><p>And look, to answer your question, Michael, here are some specific examples of why Wi-Fi is very important to the Latino community. First of all, Wi-Fi is critical to the Latino student in the small town of Sunnyside, Washington who doesn't have access to the Internet at home and has to go to the local coffee shop, which is the story of many, many students from underserved communities to use Wi-Fi to be able to complete her homework. Schools and libraries also offer students access to broadband so they can complete their homework assignments online via Wi-Fi.  </p><p>In all communities, Wi-Fi is helping to bridge the homework gap and protect more people than ever to the Internet. Wi-Fi is critical to Oscar, who is physically impaired, and uses smart home devices to help him execute critical personal and professional tasks. Wi-Fi helps the small business owners, the family in Wenatchee Washington who operate a topless truck in and Wi-Fi helps their business run more efficiently when they can easily and conveniently order their authentic Mexican food ingredients online from the Mexican bodega in California. And it also helps them attract more clients to their cargo truck who need access to Wi-Fi on their laptop.  </p><p>You know, we all know that many businesses advertise that they provide free Wi-Fi as a way to attract customers, and I have been one of those customers. I've been to many places when they offer Wi-Fi because I, you know, I needed to use my laptop. Wi-Fi is also crucial to the Latino farmworker in Salinas, California who needs to communicate with his family members via social media about the financial support he's sending via Western Union online to help his family in Mexico who needs financial support.  </p><p>Wi-Fi is important to most hospitals in the U.S. where many life-saving devices in hospitals across the country operate on Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi is also critical to Telehealth. And for the 65-year-old Latino man who lives in Brown--Brownsville, Texas who needs to can indicate with his doctor regarding his diabetes. And by the way, Brownsville, Texas is one of the least connected areas in the U.S. and there's a lot of Latinos in that area who are, obviously, not connected.  </p><p>And finally, Wi-Fi was also helpful to me. You know, when I traveled to Europe, I was able to connect to Wi-Fi to let my family know that I had arrived safely. Look, I think these examples make it very clear that we all benefit from Wi-Fi and, thus, why I keep saying that it's very important that the FTC allocate enough big band on license spectrum for Wi-Fi operations, especially in the 6 and 5.9--5.9, excuse me gigahertz bands, which will help close the digital divide by connecting people who otherwise would not have access to the valuable, you know, online resources.  </p><p>And as the number of Internet enabled devices continues to increase, and like I said, that's not going to slow down at any point, and it's having happening across all communities, the importance of Wi-Fi and obviously in turn the importance of unlicensed spectrum will also increase. And today, we simply do not have enough unlicensed spectrum available to me. Not only existing demands, but also the future demands of Wi-Fi networks with next-generation capabilities. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, thanks. John, you mentioned your research, you know, with library connectivity. Are there other community anchor institutions or civic applications that could leverage, you know, higher--higher bandwidth from next generation Wi-Fi? You know, any kind of general thoughts on--on, you know, on public services and public access? </p><p>HORRIGAN: Yeah. I mean, libraries are obviously hubs of access for people who do not have access to Wireline at home or any access at all, but there are a number of other kinds of community anchor institutions, neighborhoods, nonprofits often funded by local foundations that provide access services. And they're doing things that AJ mentioned kind of matter-of-factly, but I think often goes unnoticed by some policymakers. </p><p>AJ mentioned about the need to get hotspots to households right now and she said first you have to get them, but then you have to go out there to make sure they work and show people how to use them. That's part of AJ's job on a daily basis, but that is the function that a lot of these community technology initiatives serve not for students, but for older Americans or people who just can't afford broadband at home.  </p><p>So those institutions need a fast pipe coming into the facilities that they operate with Wi-Fi in order for them to deliver those digital skills services that they deliver to people. That not just gives them access for the sake of going online to check email, but gives them a pathway to apply for a job, build a resume, get that certification that they need to get that's often only available online to show that, for instance, they are certified to handle food safely so they could have food service jobs, for instance. So it's not just schools and libraries, but other kinds of community anchor institutions that are part of this equation as well. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay, thanks. Any other thoughts on that or--okay. So another topic, and I should mention, by the way, if, you know, those of you watching, if you have questions for the panelists, you know, please, you know, put them on the chat--on the checkbox and--and we'll go to those in a few minutes. </p><p>But I want to go back first to, you know, Priscilla described how, you know, there's different flavors of unlicensed use across--potentially across the 6 gigahertz band and as the two commissioners said, you know, their highest priority, although it's the most contentious issue right now is whether there can be lower power indoor only access, you know, or usage without the burden of database control. In other words, without having to worry about whether, you know, you have--you can tell, you know, you have the GPS to know exactly where you are without subscribing to a database control service to protect incumbents.  </p><p>Because of the way Wi-Fi works today, it truly is, you know, plug and play. You go to Best Buy for a router or you are drop shipped a router from your cable company, you plug it in, it works. If we want to add these bands to routers like that in the typical home or small business, you know, it can't be burden. So I think I'll ask Paula first and anyone else, when you consider that apps and use--when you consider the apps and use cases are going to demand increasing amounts of bandwidth and low latency, how important is it for the FCC to authorize, you know, LPI, this lower power indoor only in a way that the average, you know, household or small business can install it as cheaply and easily as upgrading a router? </p><p>BOYD: So I think it's really, really critical. You know, we talked about 5--5G offload, but you can imagine sort of a lot of the other examples that the various panelists have given over time could be enhanced and leveraged in terms of the kinds of applications, the evolution in terms of applications, the high bandwidth that will be necessary. You can imagine that once, you know, higher bandwidth application start moving over the 5G network, it's--they're not only going to stay on the 5G network, they're going to be on the wireline network, they're going to need to--to traverse over unlicensed spectrum. </p><p>And today, there's--there's not--there's no real spectrum block there to handle that kind of traffic. So from our perspective, it's just really critical to enable, you know, enable unlicensed allocation in the 6 gigahertz band. You--when you--when we think about as a company when we think about connectivity as well, we often think about our devices and our services being on devices that are--our mobile, I would say nomadic or portable. And so you're walking around the house with a tablet or a PC, you know, or you're doing that in the office as well, and--and the only--primarily, those devices connect via unlicensed spectrum. </p><p>And so if you're talking about moving really significant applications with interesting experiences that require low latency and high bandwidth, the 6 gigahertz band is just simply critical. You know, I think of unlicensed spectrum as kind of an innovation band. You know, as permission-less innovation. Anyone can leverage it and build services and devices that--that they can make available to consumers. That innovation not happening if that band isn't there. I also worry about just the connectivity that consumers have come to enjoy not occurring if that band isn't allocated for unlicensed use. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, and that's right. Thanks.--It is much as I think many people know that I've been a big supporter of being able to share underutilized bands using databases, that's what, you know, how it was mentioned earlier and that's how TV white space--we are able to use the vacant TV channels by coordinating through a database and knowing where you are located in relation to TV stations. And the same in the new citizens band, radio is not--broadband service at 3.5 gigahertz that is shared with the Navy, but if we can possibly avoid the need to have, you know, constant communication with database and that database ordination, which has a cost associated with it as well, as well as complexity, you know, that--that, you know, it would make the band so much more useful in sort of every environment, even though it would be lower power. </p><p>So any other thoughts on, you know, on this question as, you know, kind of indoor--indoor outdoor or, you know, the any constraints on use? Yeah, I know AJ said earlier, you know, obviously the schools have to move around all this data and the big schools can--can probably install and manage an enterprise grade network, but you know, for the smaller schools, you know, it will also be important.  </p><p>Paula, while I have you appear, I also wanted to touch on, you know, rural, tribal, remote areas. I think we've all been talking so much about offload that it suggests, you know, heavily urban, suburban use. Microsoft's Airband initiative has focused on leveraging unlicensed low band spectrum, the TV white spaces, to help connect rural and remote areas, including for agriculture. And what--you know, there's something like 1500 WISPs, Wireless Internet Service Providers use predominantly unlicensed spectrum as well to connect homes and mesh and businesses and less populated areas. Do you see a role for white channel Wi-Fi 6 in helping to connect rural and underserved areas? </p><p>BOYD: I--I do. You know, when you look at the--when you look at our partners in the project the deploy, they tend to leverage a variety of spectrum bands to enable connectivity. Earlier, you mentioned that when you look at the 6 gigahertz band there will be, I think it was Priscilla who mentioned this, there will be a number of different uses. So there's that very low power, there's the indoor low power, and then there's the standard power outdoor.  </p><p>And so when you--when you look at--if you think of broadband connectivity, particularly--particularly in the hard to serve areas as a challenge that will probably require a number of different solutions, we see 6 gigahertz, the standard outdoor power option as something that--that could be an opportunity for our partners as they deploy in rural areas. With that said as well, you know, what's also important as well is that, you know, as new applications come on, you want those applications to be available to everyone.  </p><p>You know, it limits your market size, it limits your customer base, it limits consumer opportunities and, frankly, it has been--you know, and adverse impact on your ability to participate as a citizen if you do not have access to those kinds of opportunities and--and applications. So, you know, so our hope is that, you know, it will come online and our partners will be able to--to deploy it where they see that it works best as they--they deploy their networks. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay, thanks. Any other--anyone else wanted to jump in on whether we need--whether we can use unlicensed spectrum out in, you know, in these other areas? I think it is important to realize some--it's kind of the flip side of the low-power indoor because outdoors in these less densely populated areas, you need higher power. And so the commission has proposed that you can use, you know, full power--the full Wi-Fi power, which is still fairly low in those areas as long as your controlled by the database to make sure you don't interfere with fixed links. </p><p>And the WISPs have proposed even higher power where there's more distance away from the incumbents, which is typically the case in, you know, once you get outside of, you know, the very--very populated areas. Okay, we are getting close to time.  </p><p>One--one question that came in, I don't know if--if anyone wants--wants to do it, this may have been intended for the commissioners initially, but--but if anyone happens to be game, the--the question is saying that the 5.9 gigahertz band is--is not well-suited for automobile safety to begin with. It doesn't go well around corners or over hills, and now that it's sandwiched between the--the spectrum that is the future for Wi-Fi, why not give them a slice of lower band spectrum instead? It may be something, you know, you know, with much better propagation and perhaps even more spectrum. So I don't know if anyone wants to venture a--an opinion on that. </p><p>BOYD: Yeah, I'll--I'll go ahead and jump in, Michael. </p><p>CALABRESE: Okay. </p><p>BOYD: You know, we--we do support a portion of the 5.9 gigahertz band being allocated for unlicensed use. You know, I think we are anticipating that it would support, you know, multiple 20-megahertz channels or 40 megahertz channels. And when you aggregate that with that spectrum that's--that is, you know, in the other U-NII4--in the U-NII4 band, and some that span the U-NII3 band, but the right rules, it would allow you to kind of leverage that additional spectrum and provide for additional broadband connectivity.  </p><p>So we--we definitely see that as a--as a good opportunity and, given sort of that scarcity of spectrum today and given the reality that increasingly we got to find ways to ensure spectrum just because spectrum is increasingly limited, we think that it's--it's a good opportunity for unlicensed, particularly as you're going to be able to leverage sort of the technologies that are being deployed in nearby bands and built all of that technology so we can get to market quickly and at a, you know, at a more decent price point then completely Greenfield spectrum. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, I can add that, you know, our consumer coalition has taken the position, and we filed comments on this last week saying that it could be a bigger win-win for consumers if the, you know, auto safety--if auto safety communication could be moved, for example, there's an almost empty public safety band at 4.9 gigahertz, which is 50 megahertz. The commission in the 5.9 gigahertz MPRN (SP) that we commented on, they're proposing to detain just 30 megahertz for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure safety signaling.  </p><p>They could potentially have even more there with better propagation because, essentially, both things are important, both safety and connectivity and to the extent that commission can, you know, have it both ways for all of us so much the better. So one last question on my end, which is, and then we'll still monitor if we can get it a quick question in from--another quick question in from the audience is, and this is probably for I guess I'll probably look to Paula and anyone else who wants to jump in is today, most Wi-Fi is operating just fine on 20 megahertz channels.  </p><p>So, you know, coming back again, because I'm not sure how explicit this was is what is the practical importance of that much wider 80 and 160 megahertz channels that could be available, you know, a single 160 at 5.9 multiple contiguous 160 megahertz channels at across the 6 gigahertz band. I mean, what--what is kind of the practical importance of--of having that kind of capacity? </p><p>BOYD: Yeah, so I'll go ahead and jump in. You know, I think folks across sort of all the three different sort of use cases, you know, very low power, indoor low-power, and the sort of full power standard power outdoor, you know, you'll have scenarios like being able to--leverage the spectrum to do things like virtual reality, you know, being able to leverage really high bandwidth applications that you--you really can't do that today at least over any real distances. So--so it essentially, without it, there's just simply a in gap in being able to do that at -east being able to do it in a seamless way in terms of leveraging broadband today.  </p><p>You might be able to do it on your mobile network, but want to leave that network, over time, you know, as 5G is deployed, you'll be able to do it in your mobile network, but once you leave that network, it becomes more challenging to do. And we live today in a very portable and mobile manner, so we're no longer sort of tied to that wire that you would--he would need if you were going to use kind of that--the high bandwidth.  </p><p>You know, I know that folks have talked about sort of wearable type scenarios as well and so--which requires--some of those--some of those experiences require higher bandwidth and, you know, at least in rural areas, you--you hear folks talk about things like precision agriculture, some of which can be done and, frankly, IOT generally, some of which can be done with very, you know with small bandwidth, but sometimes, some scenarios will need a higher bandwidth, and so those are the kinds of opportunities that I think 6 gigahertz will probably be able to afford it it's--if it's adopted. </p><p>CALABRESE: Yeah, not to mention as I think one of the commissioners said earlier, the innovation that we can't imagine today because when Wi-Fi started 20 years ago, it was in a junk band and nobody appreciated what it could turn into. Any final thoughts from anyone else on the panel? AJ, John, or Rosa? Anything you haven't said?  </p><p>Okay, well yeah, we're right out of time, so--and there's no burning questions, so we can wrap it up. I want to thank, again, think John, Paula, Rosa and AJ for staying with us this whole time and participating and being flexible as we move to a virtual event. And to all of you out there, please stay safe, say stay, basically stay home, I think, for a while and we'll hopefully get through this quickly. So the best to all of you and we'll see you again probably online and then in person soon. </p><p>MENDOZA: Thank you, Michael, and thank you to Information Technology to have this important conversation. </p><p>BOYD: Yes, thank you so much. </p><p>PHILLIPS: Thank you. Goodbye. </p><p>CALABRESE: Bye now.

They also lead to data breaches and loss of individuals' control over personal information. Existing enforcement mechanisms fail to hold data processors accountable and provide little-to-no relief for privacy violations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The privacy principles outline four concepts that any meaningful data protection legislation should incorporate at a minimum:</p><p>* Privacy protections must be strong, meaningful, and comprehensive.</p><p>* Data practices must protect civil rights, prevent unlawful discrimination, and advance equal opportunity.</p><p>* Governments at all levels should play a role in protecting and enforcing privacy rights.</p><p>* Legislation should provide redress for privacy violations.</p><p>These public interest privacy principles include a framework providing guidelines for policymakers considering how to protect the privacy of all Americans effectively while also offering meaningful redress. They follow three days of Federal Trade Commission hearings about big data, competition, and privacy as well as the comment deadline on \"Developing the Administration's Approach to Privacy,\" a request for comment from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration as the agency works to develop privacy policy recommendations for the Trump Administration, and ongoing work at the National Institute for Standards and Technology to develop a privacy risk framework.</p><p>The groups urge members of Congress to pass privacy legislation that ensures fairness, prevents discrimination, advances equal opportunity, protects free expression, and facilitates trust between the public and companies that collect their personal data.</p><p>New America's Open Technology Institute, Public Knowledge, Access Humboldt, Access Now, Berkeley Media Studies Group, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology, Center for Digital Democracy, Center for Media Justice, Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology at Georgetown Law, Color of Change, Common Cause, Common Sense Kids Action, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Customer Commons, Demand Progress, Free Press Action Fund, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Media Alliance, Media Mobilizing Project, National Association of Consumer Advocates, National Consumer Law Center, National Consumers League, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, National Hispanic Media Coalition, Oakland Privacy, Open MIC (Open Media and Information Companies Initiative), Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, and United Church of Christ, OC Inc. signed the principles. Additional local and national privacy advocates are encouraged to sign on.</p><p>The following can be attributed to Eric Null, Senior Policy Counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute:</p><p>\"For decades, privacy regulation has favored the company over the user--companies set their own rules and users are left to fend for themselves. Worse, companies have even discriminated based on protected classes through algorithmic decision-making. Comprehensive privacy legislation must disrupt this status quo. Legislation that follows the public interest privacy principles will better protect users and give users more control over their data.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Allie Bohm, Policy Counsel at Public Knowledge:</p><p>\"It is imperative that any comprehensive privacy legislation reflect the concerns, interests, and priorities of actual human beings. Today, consumer protection, privacy, and civil rights groups come together to articulate those interests, priorities, and concerns. Importantly, these principles address the many harms people can experience from privacy violations and misuse of personal data, including enabling unfair price discrimination; limiting awareness of opportunities; and contributing to employment, housing, health care, and other forms of discrimination.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Amie Stepanovich, U.S. Policy Manager at Access Now:</p><p>\"From Europe to India to Brazil, data privacy legislation is becoming the norm around the world, and people in the United States are getting left behind. It is long past time that our legislators acted to protect people across the country from opaque data practices that can result in its misuse and abuse, and any acceptable package must start with these principles.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Josh Golin, Executive Director at Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood:</p><p>\"What big tech offers for \"free\" actually comes at a high cost--our privacy. Worst of all is how vulnerable kids are tracked online and then targeted with manipulative marketing. This has to stop. We need laws that will empower parents to protect their children's privacy.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Joseph Jerome, Policy Counsel at Center for Democracy &amp;#38; Technology:</p><p>\"Debates about national privacy laws focus on how companies should implement Fair Information Practices. The operative word is 'fair.' When it comes to how companies collect, use, and share our data, too many business practices are simply unfair. Federal law must go beyond giving consumers more notices and choices about their privacy, and we think it is time for legislators in Congress to flip the privacy presumption and declare some data practices unfair.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katharina Kopp, Director of Policy at Center for Digital Democracy:</p><p>\"To this day, U.S. citizens have had to live without effective privacy safeguards. Commercial data practices have grown ever more intrusive, ubiquitous and harmful. It is high time to provide Americans with effective safeguards against commercial surveillance. Any legislation must not only effectively protect individual privacy, it must advance equitable, just and fair data uses, and must protect the most vulnerable among us, including children. In other words, they must bring about real changes in corporate practices. We have waited long enough; the time is now.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Laura Moy, Executive Director at Center on Privacy &amp;#38; Technology at Georgetown Law:</p><p>\"Americans want their data to be respected, protected, and used in ways that are consistent with their expectations. Any new legislation governing commercial data practices must advance these goals, and also protect us from data-driven activities that are harmful to society. We need privacy to protect us from uses of data that exclude communities from important opportunities, enable faceless brokers to secretly build ever-more-detailed profiles of us, and amplify political polarization and hate speech.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Yosef Getachew, Director of Media and Democracy Program at Common Cause:</p><p>\"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe they have lost control over how their personal information is collected and used across the internet ecosystem. Numerous data breaches and abuses in data sharing practices, which have jeopardized the personal information of millions of Americans, have validated these fears. Our current privacy framework no longer works, and the lack of meaningful privacy protections poses a serious threat to our democracy. Companies can easily manipulate data to politically influence voters or engage in discriminatory practices. These principles should serve as a baseline for any comprehensive privacy legislation that guarantees all Americans control over their data.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to James P. Steyer, CEO and Founder, at Common Sense:</p><p>\"Any federal legislation should provide for strong baseline protections, particularly for the most surveilled and vulnerable generation ever -- our kids. These principles reflect that as privacy, consumer, and civil rights advocates, we only want federal legislation that will move the ball forward in terms of protecting kids, families, and all of us.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Linda Sherry, director of national priorities at Consumer Action:</p><p>\"Our country has floundered far too long without strong federal regulations governing data collection, retention, use and sharing. These privacy principles, developed by a coalition of leading consumer, civil rights and privacy organizations, are offered as a framework to guide Congress in protecting consumers from the many harms that can befall them when they are given little or no choice in safeguarding their data, and companies have few, if any, restrictions on how they use that information.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Susan Grant, Director of Consumer Protection and Privacy at Consumer Federation of America:</p><p>\"We need to move forward on data protection in the United States, from a default that allows companies to do what they want with Americans' personal information as long as they don't lie about it, to one in which their business practices are aligned with respect for privacy rights and the responsibility to keep people's data secure.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Katie McInnis, Policy Counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports:</p><p>\"As new data breaches are announced at an alarming rate, now is the time to protect consumers with strong privacy laws. We need laws that do more than just address broad transparency and access rights. Consumers deserve practical controls and robust enforcement to ensure all of their personal information is sufficiently protected.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Gaurav Laroia, Policy Counsel at Free Press Action Fund:</p><p>\"The public has lost faith in technology companies' interest and ability to police their own privacy and data usage practices. It's past time for Congress to pass a strong law that empowers people to make meaningful choices about their data, protects them from discrimination and undue manipulation, and holds companies accountable for those practices.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to David Brody, Counsel &amp;#38; Senior Fellow for Privacy and Technology at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law:</p><p>\"Protecting the right to privacy is essential to protecting civil rights and advancing racial equity in a modern, Internet-focused society. Privacy rights are civil rights. Invasive profiling of online activity enables discrimination in employment, housing, credit, and education; helps bad actors target voter suppression and misinformation; assists biased law enforcement surveillance; chills the free association of advocates; and creates connections between hateful extremists exacerbating racial tensions.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Tracy Rosenberg, Executive Director at Media Alliance:</p><p>\"After a flood of data breaches and privacy violations, Americans overwhelmingly support meaningful protections for their personal information that are not written by, for and in the interests of the data collection industry. These principles start to define what that looks like.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Francella Ochillo, Vice President of Policy &amp;#38; General Counsel at National Hispanic Media Coalition:</p><p>\"For years, tech platforms have been allowed to monetize personal data without oversight or consequence, losing sight of the fact that personal data belongs to the user. Meanwhile, Latinos and other marginalized communities continue to be exposed to the greatest risk of harm and have the fewest opportunities for redress. The National Hispanic Media Coalition joins the chorus of advocates calling for a comprehensive regulatory framework that protects a user's right to privacy and access as well as the right to be forgotten.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to JP Massar, Organizer at Oakland Privacy:</p><p>\"We must not only watch the watchers, and regulate the sellers of our information. We must begin to unravel the information panopticon that has already formed. This is a start.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Robert Weissman, President at Public Citizen:</p><p>\"Internet privacy means control. Either we get to control our own lives as lived through the Internet, or the Big Tech companies do. That's what is at stake in whether the U.S. adopts real privacy protections.\"</p><p>The following can be attributed to Ed Mierzwinski, Senior Director for Consumer Programs at U.S. PIRG:</p><p>\"The big banks and the big tech companies all say that they want a federal privacy law, but the law that their phalanx of lobbyists seeks isn't designed to protect consumers. Instead, it's designed to protect their business models that treat consumers as commodities for sale; it fails to guarantee that their secret sauce big data algorithms don't discriminate; it eliminates stronger and innovative state laws forever and it denies consumers any real, enforceable rights when harmed. We can't allow that.\"</p><p>You may view the privacy principles for more information.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6522964 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6522964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TS9-3CF1-DYG2-R42F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2222\"/><timeReceived>7:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 13, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The announcement follows similar inquiries under way in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust oversight responsibilities with the Justice Department.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Justice Department did not name specific companies in a news release announcing its review, but noted that it would look into concerns about search, social media and some retail services - presumably putting Google, Facebook and Amazon on notice.</p><p>The pressure on tech giants has ended decades of deferential treatment toward the industry. In Congress, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is holding hearings and conducting its own investigation of the market power and behavior of the big tech companies.</p><p>At a hearing last week, with witnesses from Mountain View's Google, Menlo Park's Facebook, Amazon and Cupertino's Apple, Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the subcommittee, said that the government stance for too long was to celebrate the new tech economy rather than scrutinize its corporate leaders.</p><p>\"Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\" Cicilline, D-R.I., said in his opening statement. \"As a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Cicilline sent letters to three of the companies at last week's hearing - Google, Facebook and Apple. He is seeking answers to questions posed at the hearing, but not directly addressed by the witnesses. Cicilline characterized those earlier replies as \"evasive, incomplete or misleading.\"</p><p>In announcing the review, the Justice Department said it would look into whether the internet companies are \"harming consumers.\" For most of the past four decades, U.S. courts and regulators have interpreted the consumer harm standard of antitrust to mean that company behavior led to higher prices, but it's challenging to make that argument when services like Google and Facebook are free and Amazon is celebrated for low prices and convenient delivery.</p><p>This latest review comes on the heels of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission splitting up potential antitrust investigations into Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. It's not clear how this review will differ from the investigations into the individual companies.</p><p>Google and Facebook declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Apple referred to comments made by its CEO, Tim Cook, in a recent television interview on CBS News.</p><p>\"I think we should be scrutinized,\" Cook said. \"But if you look at any kind of measure about 'is Apple a monopoly or not,' I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly.\"</p><p>While the major American technology companies have largely avoided antitrust scrutiny at home, they have been investigated more aggressively around the world, especially in Europe.</p><p>In March, European authorities fined Google about $1.7 billion for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. The regulators said Google had violated antitrust rules by imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe. The fine was the third against Google by the European Union since 2017.</p><p>The United States, by contrast, has been seen as a lesser force in antitrust enforcement recently, with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission moving more cautiously.</p><p>\"If the United States does not step up, competition policy will be set elsewhere,\" said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>\"American technology companies have been investigated more aggressively around the world, especially in Europe.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SFCHRN-B612606144Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMY-8WT1-JC8F-52KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 San Francisco Chronicle All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Francisco Chronicle (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But these paint only part of the picture, according to Greenspun.</p><p>The bottom line is health plan executives will wonder how to get a return on investment (ROI) out of any technological device that consumers demand the industry incorporate into the healthcare picture. In order for health plans to entertain the possibility of embracing (and reimbursing for) technology such as the Apple Watch, Greenspun predicts they'll need four pieces of evidence:</p><p>Rationale: Just as consumers need motivatation, health plan execs need a reason to endorse the new technology.

There will be significant penalties for noncompliance.\" </p><p>Mr Fletcher said the bargaining arrangements would not be available to the nation's public broadcasters ABC and SBS because they were funded by the government and not through advertising revenue. </p><p>\"The ABC and SBS are not in scope to benefit from remuneration aspects of the draft code,\" he said. \"The ABC and SBS are not the policy focus when it comes to remuneration aspects of the proposed mandatory code.\" </p><p>Mr Fletcher said the code outlines requirements covering bargaining arrangements between the parties, minimum standards relating to the presentation of news, and a penalty regime.</p><p>Responding the announcement of the code, an ABC spokesman referred The Australian to the broadcaster's June submission to the ACCC, which argued it should be part of any framework facilitating access to revenue arrangements.</p><p>\"If the ACCC forms the view that there is value to third-party digital platforms in having news media content (including from the ABC) and establishes a mechanism for platforms to better share this value with news media organisations then the ABC should be part of this framework,\" the ABC submission said.</p><p>\"Any additional revenue accruing to the ABC as a result of the Code would be applied to the delivery of ABC Charter objectives. In this case, the ABC's disposition would be to direct funds to further investment in public interest journalism at the local and regional level.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-a66e231f7a957efdf6835000ac47d65c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GH-FSK1-JBR4-F15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><timeReceived>2:50 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You've collected so many stories from people in their own words from that day. It's sort of a 360-degree walk through, minute by minute, of September 11th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is it important to have that perspective?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GARRETT GRAFF, AUTHOR, \"THE ONLY PLANE IN THE SKY: AN ORAL HISTORY OF 9/11\": I think the importance of hearing that day in people's own voices is that we're 18 years removed from this. And what we now remember are sort of the facts of the day. And we remember it as this very clean, neat story in some ways. You know, the attacks began at 8:46 in the morning with the first crash, ended at 10:29 with the second collapse of the second tower.</p><p>That's not how any of us experienced it that day. It was a day of confusion and fear and trauma. We didn't know when the attacks had begun. We didn't know when they were over. There were fears well into the afternoon of more hijacked planes, of second wave attacks, sleeper cells in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p>And to really understand all that has unfolded after 9/11, up to and including this week with the collapse of the Taliban peace talks, you have to understand, I think, the way that America experienced and lived that day.</p><p>BERMAN: From the very top, to the very bottom. I mean from the White House and the inner sanctum there, I think, to the people who were walking on the streets of Manhattan.</p><p>And let's just go to one clip here that's been getting a lot of press. This has to do with Commander Anthony Barnes, the deputy director of the president contingency programs. He was the one who wanted the order for the OK to shoot down the hijacked planes, if they needed to.</p><p>Let me read a clip here.</p><p>The Pentagon thought there was another hijacked plane, and they were asking for permission to shoot down an identified hijacked commercial aircraft. I asked the vice president that question and he answered it in the affirmative. I asked again to be sure. Sir, I am confirming that you have given permission? For me being a military member and an aviator, understanding the absolute depth of that question was and what the answer was, I wanted to make sure that there was no mistake whatsoever about what was being asked. Without hesitation, in the affirmative, he said, any confirmed hijacked airplane may be engaged and shot down.</p><p>You were the first person to get this interview with him. That's an incredible moment.</p><p>GRAFF: Yes, and the way that he understood, in that moment, the immense power of what he was asking. I mean this was the request to shoot down a civilian, domestic airliner over American air space, and he went right back to Cheney and asked again to confirm. And Cheney actually was quite annoyed to be asked a second time. Cheney had made his decision. He knew it was the right thing to do, and he wanted to move on.</p><p>BERMAN: You also have stories from pilots who were flying with planes that didn't have weapons on them but discussed, if it came to it, they would ram one of the hijacked planes.</p><p>GRAFF: We were totally unprepared for this attack on 9/11. And many of the first fighter jets launched into the air that day were launched, scrambled without weapons aboard. And the pilots, as they were taking off, knew that if they had to confront a hijacked plane, they might actually have to ram it themselves in a kamikaze mission. That this was the only tool that was available to them was their own fighter.</p><p>BERMAN: You talk about the confusion. There was a big part of the day, everything felt big. It was probably no more than 45 minutes or an hour where they actually thought the plane that crashed in Shanksville was much closer to Camp David. And that influenced decisions for a long time.</p><p>GRAFF: That was one of the main reasons actually why the president did not come immediately back to Washington. You know, the president was at Emma Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, rushed aboard Air Force One, and the plane eventually sort of spent the day flying around the southeastern United States, first to Louisiana, then to Nebraska, finally back to Washington.</p><p>And throughout it -- and this, again, goes to the confusion and the trauma of that day. You know, this was 2001. No e-mail. No cable TV. The president is picking up rabbit ear antennas, local TV coverage as he's flying around the country. And so for most of the day the president of the United States, on 9/11, less informed than the average American sitting at home watching CNN.</p><p>BERMAN: And I remember how hard it was to get anyone on cell phone that day or anyone because all the signals were jammed.</p><p>Garrett, you make the point in the forward here, when we talk about 9/11, those of us who were alive that day, those of us who experienced in different ways, whenever we begin the conversations, most people gravitate toward wanting to tell you about where I was and what I was doing, how I experienced that.</p><p>Why is that important?</p><p>GRAFF: Well, this was in some ways the first global catastrophe that the world had ever experienced before or since. I mean we all watched this unfold actually on many of the morning shows that day. We watched that first crash and then the second crash live on TV.</p><p>[08:35:02]</p><p>And so the attacks rippled across the country in a way that we have never really experienced. And so, you know, when part of the power, I think, of this book, in telling this story, coast to coast, morning to night, is this realization of just how many lives were touched and affected by 9/11.</p><p>BERMAN: I have to say, I think historians will owe you a debt of gratitude for this book. This will, I think, impact generations in the way they study September 11th.</p><p>Garrett Graff, thanks so much for coming on and congratulations.</p><p>GRAFF: Thanks for having me for this discussion.</p><p>BERMAN: Bianna.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA, CNN ANCHOR: John and Garrett, it really is something that 18 years later we continue to learn more details about that day that really changed the country and the world. Fascinating.</p><p>Well, coming up, Apple's big event is just hours away. What we know about new iPhone and more. It's coming up next.</p><p>[08:40:16]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Today, a special election in North Carolina's Ninth District could give us our first real window in President Trump's re- election strategy.</p><p>John Avlon explains in our \"Reality Check.\"</p><p>John.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Hey, guys.</p><p>So while you've been paying attention to 2020, it might surprise you to know that 2018 isn't over yet. And that all ends today with a high drama special election in North Carolina's Ninth. And this story's got everything, back room deals, son turning against fathers, even a shady political operative who almost took his secrets to the grave.</p><p>And the stakes couldn't be higher. Just ask President Trump, who parachuted into the district last night to throw reinforcements behind Republican Dan Bishop, while accusing Democrats of being, quote, not big believers in religion.</p><p>Bishop's opponent is Democrat Dan McCready. He's a Marine and small business own. And yet he's being painted as a radical socialist. And that tells you a lot about the campaign Republicans are planning to run in 2020.</p><p>But, first, a little back story.</p><p>So Trump won the Ninth by almost 20 points. It's a safe Republican seat by design. A classic example of the rigged system of redistricting which politicians choose their voters instead of the other way around.</p><p>But apparently it wasn't quite rigged hard enough because when this guy, Republican Mark Harris, (INAUDIBLE), he got a tiny victory over McCready in 2018. The state elections board refused to certify it.</p><p>Now, remember Trump's closing argument about fearmongering and voter fraud? Well, it turns out that the only significant incident was engineered by North Carolina Republican operatives accused to -- of offering to collect and then lose absentee ballots, mostly from voters who looked like this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: When the names were picked, do you want this guy or that guy, this gal or that guy, was that you picking them?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Uh-uh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: It was so bad that not only was a new election called, but they ran it all the way back to the primary.</p><p>Now, Harris dropped out citing his health, but he might as well have been citing embarrassment after his own son testified that he knew about potential fraud. So Republicans elevated this guy, State Senator Dan Bishop. A climate change denier who sponsored North Carolina's infamous bathroom bill that led to a boycott of the state.</p><p>But Bishop's been calling McCready the radical, even saying that he really admires socialism, something \"Politifact\" called \"pants on fire.\"</p><p>Now, polls show this race is too close to call, but Republicans should have an edge because they drew the map that way. And if you doubt redistricting is dirty, folks, take a look through the files of a recently deceased Republican operative who specialized in this stuff. \"The New Yorker\" published some of his internal maps used to rig elections in North Carolina. And this guy went so far as to split up a historically black college in North Carolina right down to the dorms just to dilute the black vote. His files indicate that voter ID was designed to depress the Democratic vote, particularly among young people and minorities.</p><p>So, yes, today's special election matters in North Carolina. It's a test of the Trump re-election playbook, tarring all Democrats as radical socialists. It's also a test of whether Democratic enthusiasm can overcome gerrymandering in a crucial swing state. Make no mistake, Republicans should have the edge, but if Democrats carry McCready over the line, it could be a bad sign for Trump in 2020.</p><p>And that's your \"Reality Check.\"</p><p>BERMAN: And, again, look at the results, but also look at the margins here. If the Republican wins by 12 points, maybe this strategy for the president and Republicans will work going forward. It's one or two points, a different story.</p><p>AVLON: Exactly.</p><p>BERMAN: Thanks so much, John.</p><p>All right, time for \"CNN Business Now.\"</p><p>Apple's big event is now just hours away. CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans joins us with what to expect.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, you guys.</p><p>Yes, this happens at 1:00 Eastern Time. You know, don't hold your breath, though, for an iPhone that's foldable, 5G capable or even radically different from last year's models. Here's what Apple we think is likely to announce instead. Three new high-end phones, the iPhone 11, 11 pro and 11 pro max. New features like a faster processor, improved face ID and a new camera. The Apple Watch is also expected to get a refresh with built-in sleep tracking, something I need. Some of its competitors are launching innovative and riskier concepts like, you know, Samsung's foldable smartphone and its two 5G devices. But Apple is expected to stay the course here.</p><p>But that may be risky. The iPhone business, you know, is still Apple's single biggest moneymaker. It's been lackluster lately. Customers are waiting longer to upgrade their phones and the trade war is denting demand in China, which was once one of Apple's most promising markets. Apple could also announce updates to other hardware products, including the iPad and MacBook's.</p><p>What not to expect from today's event? A 5G iPhone. Guys, that won't likely come until sometime in 2020.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: But you're right, all the focus is on those iPhone sales. Three straight quarters of declines. A lot riding on them.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Thanks so much, Christine.</p><p>Well, almost every state in the nation is now investigating Google for possible anti-trust violations. We'll talk to one of the attorneys general who just launched the probe coming up next.</p><p>BERMAN: First, a survivor who has dedicated his second chance at life to suicide prevention. This week's \"Turning Points.\"</p><p>[08:45:03]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For Kevin Hines (ph), the sight of the Golden Gate Bridge is an emotional one. On September 25, 2000, then 19-year-old Hines struggled with mental illness and jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>KEVIN HINES: I hit the water and the impact reverberated through my legs and it just shattered my T12, L1 and L2. The very millisecond my hands left the rail, and my legs cleared it, instant regret.</p><p>GUPTA (on camera): This is the place where you jumped?</p><p>HINES: Yes. This is the place where I lived.</p><p>GUPTA (voice over): Over the last two decades, the suicide rate in the United States has gone up 33 percent, making it the number two cause of death in this country for people aged 10 to 34. Hines has spent the last 16 years as an activist for suicide prevention. His goal, to get a net attached to the Golden Gate Bridge, a barrier to stop someone from dying. And his fight meant something. The net is finally going up.</p><p>GUPTA (on camera): There it is.</p><p>HINES: That's the net. It's going up on the Golden Gate as of 2021. This is one of the most special days of my life.</p><p>GUPTA (voice over): Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN, reporting.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[08:51:11]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Google and FaceBook are both now the targets of major anti- trust investigations. Fifty attorneys general are examining whether Google harmed competition and consumers through its search and advertising businesses. Eight states and the District of Columbia are also investigating whether FaceBook stifled competition.</p><p>Joining me now is Ohio's attorney general, Dave Yost, who is involved in both investigations.</p><p>You're a very busy man, Mr. Attorney General. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DAVE YOST, OHIO ATTORNEY GENERAL: Thank you. GOLODRYGA: Given that these investigations have bipartisan support, can you talk about what it is exactly that you are concerned about with regards to these companies' practices?</p><p>YOST: Well, the question is, are their practices stifling competition? Are they hurting innovation? And we're just at the very beginning of fact collecting about that, looking at the evidence. But there's plenty of reason to be concerned, I think.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: And these were investigations and lawsuits that we've seen Google, for instance, involved in, in Europe.</p><p>What, if anything, have you taken away from how European governments, in the EU in particular, has approached this particular dilemma?</p><p>YOST: Well, obviously, it's a different environment over there, different legal environment, different legal questions. But the record in the proceedings in Europe are going to be very valuable to us in our investigation in guiding our questions and our work.</p><p>You know, ultimately, anti-trust is really about power and constraining power. Money, and after the industrial revolution, was the means by which monopolists tried to control society and to limit freedom. But it was fundamentally about power.</p><p>Today, data is the new money. And that's what is going on in big tech.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Let me ask you about FaceBook in particular. They've got over 2 billion users worldwide. Obviously, they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well.</p><p>Are you specifically concerned with this company having too much of a hold on social media in general?</p><p>YOST: As the attorney general in Ohio, I'm very concerned about that. Look, FaceBook has got 70 percent of the social media market by one estimate. And they control a huge quantity of information. Both the information that flows outward into our society, but also information about us integrated between the different things that they -- that they -- the different apps that they have.</p><p>And there's some real concern that they are able to use that to gain competitive -- competition stifling advantages. Those are good questions that we need to be having a debate about here in 2019.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: But couldn't you argue that it's ultimately up to the users? Nobody's forcing people to log on to FaceBook. Nobody's forcing people to search on Google. Couldn't, in terms of talking about a free market system, couldn't it be left up to users as opposed to attorney generals inquiring about certain practices?</p><p>YOST: So free markets require competition. Without them, they're not free markets. We might as well just as well ask -- nobody -- or say nobody's forcing anyone to use Cornelius Vanderbilt's railroads. The idea is when one group, one company, one individual is able to control an entire market segment, or so much of it, that it stifles competition, we no longer have free markets. And attorneys general are here to make sure that the rules of the road, if you will, allow everybody an opportunity to compete.</p><p>[08:55:04]</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Will you -- will you be pushing to hear from heads of these organizations, in particular Mark Zuckerberg at FaceBook?</p><p>YOST: Well, we are at the very beginning stages of this investigation, and there are a lot of questions that need to be answered, a lot of information that needs to be gathered. So, you know, predicting the course and comparing precedence, we'll have to wait for the future to get there.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Well, and in addition to the state's investigations, we know there's a federal investigation as well into some of these practices. So, obviously, this is a story that has nationwide attention and implications.</p><p>We want to appreciate -- thank you and we appreciate your time for joining us. Thank you.</p><p>YOST: Thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: And it's so interesting. This is something that does have some bipartisan support there.</p><p>GOLODRYGA: Of course. It's rare.</p><p>BERMAN: Democrats in the House who are pushing for these investigations and regulations, as is the administration.</p><p>CNN is getting some brand-new reporting. This is Jim Sciutto's reporting on the CIA spy asset the U.S. pulled out of Russia. Well, Jim's got some new reporting this morning. This time about President Trump's views on foreign intelligence and the use of spies in general. That's next.</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: A very good morning to you. I'm Jim Sciutto.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Poppy Harlow.</p><p>We do begin this morning again with new reporting on the president and the U.S. intelligence community.</p><p>[09:00:05]</p><p>After your remarkable exclusive reporting yesterday, there have been a lot of developments.

The so-called 'New Brandeis' approach seeks to shift the focus of antitrust law from consumer welfare alone to include the competitive structure of markets. Recent attention to these arguments is often traced to the publication of Lina Khan's Yale Law Journal article \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox.\"[1] (Khan, who previously served as an advisor to FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra, was just hired as counsel for the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law.)[1] Indeed, as we discussed last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings focusing on potential changes to the consumer welfare standard currently used by federal courts in evaluating antitrust claims. The primary critique made by the New Brandeisians is that modern antitrust law is singularly focused on promoting consumer welfare in the form of low prices, but this approach ignores both legislative history (which shows that statutory drafters were concerned with dominant market power regardless of its effects) and the potential deleterious impacts of monopoly other than supracompetitive pricing (such as the diversity and quality of goods available in a market). According to New Brandeisian critiques, these problems can be corrected by shifting the focus of the law back to the structure of markets, thereby ensuring they remain open and competitive. </p><p>New Brandeisians argue that the failure to make these corrections leave current antitrust jurisprudence ill-suited to protect against the anticompetitive issues posed by the internet, the technology sector, and related industries. In these industries, they argue, companies use tactics to grow their market power that the law currently regards as unobjectionable, but nonetheless have long-term anticompetitive effects on the markets in which they operate. For example, many antitrust economists and other practitioners argue that predatory pricing (pricing goods below cost in an attempt to drive rivals out of business) is of minimal concern on the grounds that a monopolist will almost never be able to recoup their losses by raising their prices after competitors exit the market and the likelihood of complete existing is small. New Brandeisians, however, argue that tech companies that operate platforms such as Amazon or Facebook may be able to successfully engage in this practice (without recouping foregone profits) because network effects spur a winner-takes-all race where an increase in market share increases the durability of that share. The two-sided nature of platforms and the diversity of their offerings may make it harder to detect recoupments (to the extent they occur) if they are extracted from producers (rather than consumers) or on a product different from the one that was predatorily priced. The potential for invisible recoupment is exacerbated by the ability of e-commerce companies to offer individual prices to individual customers, which makes it difficult to even measure prices in the aggregate. Antitrust law today is similarly reluctant to challenge vertical integration by firms for fear of the loss of efficiency such integration may bring and the difficulty in demonstrating actual adverse competitive effects. But as a potential counterexample, in her article Khan explains that through vertical integration, Amazon has begun competing with firms that depend on it. For example, Amazon is able to extract large discounts from shippers because of its size, but shippers then try to make up for these discounts by extracting higher prices from independent sellers. This 'waterbed effect' helped grow Amazon's Fulfillment-by-Amazon ('FBA') service through which it stores, packs, and ships the goods of independent sellers. '[B]ecause Amazon had secured discounts unavailable to other sellers, it was cheaper for those sellers to go through Amazon than to use UPS and FedEx directly. Amazon had used its dominance in the retail sector to create and boost a new venture in the delivery sector, inserting itself into the business of its competitors.' A seller that uses the FBA service is likely to be listed higher on Amazon search results, so the growth of its logistics arm reinforces its hold on the e-commerce market. Amazon can also use the data it gathers from sellers and customers to evaluate what product markets to enter as a manufacturer under its AmazonBasics brand. And once it starts manufacturing a product, it can boost its visibility and adjust its pricing to help it outsell its rivals. Khan proposes two solutions to the issues she flags: direct regulation of certain platforms as public utilities or common carriers or structural remedies, like prohibiting companies from getting into certain lines of business and requiring divestment of some business units. As we noted previously[2], Khan's article (and the New Brandeis approach) is both the subject of criticism and support. But at least one declared presidential candidate\u2014United States Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2014has aligned herself with the New Brandeis arguments. In early March, Warren called for '[r]estoring competition in the tech sector' through 'break[ing] up Big Tech.' In a blog post[3], she claims that 'big tech companies have achieved their level of dominance in part based on two strategies: using mergers to limit competition [and] using proprietary marketplaces to limit competition.' She then explains that, going back to the Progressive Era, America has recognized that 'ownership of a network and participating on the network caused a conflict of interest,' and instead of nationalizing such industries, America has 'required structural separation between the network and other businesses, and . . . demand[ing] that the network offer fair and non-discriminatory service.' Senator Warren advocates addressing perceived problems posed by tech platforms in two ways. First, Congress would pass legislation 'that requires large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform.' Larger companies that meet the definition of a 'platform utility' would be 'prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform'; 'required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users'; and 'not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.' Smaller platforms would not have the same structural impediments but would also need to abide by the same standard of fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Under this law, Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange, and Google Search would 'platform utilities.' 'Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.' Second, her administration 'would appoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.' Some mergers Senator Warren would unwind include Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos; Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram; and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick. It is far too early to tell whether any of these ideas will gain further traction during the upcoming election (or further in the future), but their increasing prominence in debates about antitrust law make them worth monitoring. We'll continue to post future updates about future developments. [1] Representative David Cicilline, the chairman of this subcommittee, published an opinion article in the New York Times on March 19, 2019[4] calling for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook for potential antitrust violations, particularly in relation to how it exploits the data it has amassed. He warned that if the FTC found that Facebook had violated a consent decree governing its use of user data, 'a fine in the low billions of dollars' would be an insufficient punishment that would merely 'amount to a slap on the wrist' for the company.
