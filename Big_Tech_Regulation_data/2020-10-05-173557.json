In a statement, it promised \"a top-to-bottom review of the market power held by giant tech platforms,\" which would be the first such Congress has ever undertaken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Shares of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple dropped significantly Monday after published reports suggested that federal authorities are preparing for investigations into anticompetitive behavior by several of these technology giants.</p><p>Facebook's stock dropped 7.5%. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell 6.1%. Amazon declined 4.6%. Apple, which has only been mentioned tangentially in these reports, fell 1%.</p><p> Some of the underlying developments appear to represent a divvying up of turf between the Department of Justice's antitrust cops and the Federal Trade Commission, which also holds antitrust authority. The Justice Department would reportedly hold authority over Google and Apple, while the FTC would take point on investigations of Facebook and Amazon.</p><p> Over the weekend, multiple reports said the Justice Department was preparing a competition investigation into Google. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources to report that the FTC has secured the rights to bring a possible investigation into Facebook .</p><p> Investors may have reacted immediately to the uncertainty, but investigations - if any materialize - would take years.</p><p> \"I think (the speculation) is becoming more real, but antitrust is not a 24-hour event,\" said Blair Levin, a fellow with the Brookings Institution who formerly served as chief of staff to a Federal Communications Commission chairman.</p><p> It's clear that the government is paying increasing attention to the actions of big tech companies, he said, but outcomes could take many different forms. Most likely, he said, could be regulation of the companies' various practices, including privacy policies.</p><p> Pressure has been mounting on government to scrutinize the companies for some time, as backlash against tech companies' reach and power grow in among consumers and politicians.</p><p> The splitting up of jurisdictions between the FTC and DOJ could be simply a response to the pressure, said Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director for Open Markets Institute, which advocates against monopolies.</p><p> \"There's still a long way to go before there is even an investigation,\" he said. \"And an investigation could be an extended process.\"</p><p> European authorities have covered ground U.S. regulators have barely considered - resulting in billions of dollars in fines for Google, and lesser fines for other companies.</p><p> That's one model the U.S. could follow, Levin said. But political motivations and laws differ in the U.S., and regulations haven't nearly caught up with the fast-moving world of the tech industry.</p><p> Vaheesan would like to see the government take aim at what Open Markets sees as market dominating practices by the big companies - partially by undoing large acquisitions that tech giants have made, including Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's of YouTube.</p><p> But others think it's unlikely the government would take such broad action.</p><p> \"The problem with all this antitrust talk: the consumer isn't being gouged,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.</p><p> Stocks are sinking because investors don't like uncertainty, he said. But in this case, \"the reaction vastly exceeds the potential harm to the company from a fine,\" he said.</p><p> The FTC is already investigating Facebook for possible privacy violations. Facebook has set aside $3 billion for a possible fine for that investigation and said it could be as high as $5 billion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes the keynote speech at F8 on April 30, the Facebook's developer conference, in San Jose, Calif.

We need more detailed work on specific areas - not broad-brush criticism of the entire industry.</p><p>activity. But the high commissions charged to third-party developers on Apple's App Store is an entirely different issue to the market dominance of Amazon Web Services, its highly profitable cloud computing arm, or the stranglehold over digital advertising enjoyed by Google and Facebook - or the issues around data mining and privacy linked to the growing popularity of home voice assistants like Alexa.

Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) last week signed on to be a co-sponsor to a bill that would allow newspapers to collectively negotiate with tech giants like Google and Facebook.Why it matters: The move represents a truly bipartisan effort to get something done in Washington, for a change. With the Senate majority leader's support, it's much more likely that the bill will pass in both chambers and be signed into law by the president.Details: The bill, which is formally called the Journalism Competition ...eservation Act, would provide a temporary safe harbor[1] for news publishers to collectively negotiate with Facebook and Google for better distribution deals. </p><p>It was first introduced[2] in the House in 2018 by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the top Democrat on the House Antitrust Subcommittee, in response to pressure[3] from one of the biggest trade groups representing thousands of newspapers, the News Media Alliance, asking Congress in 2017 to consider passing such legislation. It was re-introduced in April 2019 after Democrats took back the House and has since garnered further support, especially in the Senate. Sens. John Kennedy (R-La.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced a companion bill in the Senate during the summer of 2019. Members from both sides, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) have since co-sponsored the bill. The big picture: McConnell's support can be seen as an example of how members need to balance local needs with national politics. Many members, feeling the pressure from their local constituencies, are being urged to do something about the crisis at home with local news. But nationally, they are happy to call out major newspapers when they are critical of their policies or their party. What they're saying: \"Members of Congress are realizing the urgency and importance of this issue, especially for local news publishers,\" said David Chavern, president and CEO of News Media Alliance, in a statement on McConnell's support. The big picture: Google and Facebook control up to 60% of the digital advertising economy in the U.S., a market that used to be controlled by media companies. This bill aims to give news companies, including many local papers, the power to collectively demand that big online giants pay them more for their work, or give them more data, brand visibility and control of their product on their platforms. Yes, but: While the regulatory power pendulum[4] is slowly swinging back to those that do actually own and create content, many local media companies have faced so many challenges in the digital era that now seem beyond repair. Our thought bubble: It's unlikely that collective bargaining power will do much to help thousands of struggling news outlets get paid adequately for their work on the internet, as tech companies have a long history of fighting these kinds of negotiating efforts. Google News, for example, pulled out of Spain several years ago after regulators signed a copyright bill into law that would require them to pay news publishers. It's threatened[5] to do the same thing in Europe in the next few years if regulators pass new copyright provisions there. Be smart: The move is part of a larger trend within a Republican-controlled Washington to de-regulate[6] legacy industries so that they can better compete with technology companies, instead of adding regulations to technology companies. Regulators have already begun to roll back decades-old rules that limited the reach of broadcasters and newspapers. The efforts come as bipartisan frustration with tech companies has taken over Washington. Bottom line: What the passage of this bill would really do is send a message to internet giants that policymakers are looking for ways to level the playing field between tech giants and news companies.

Members of both parties demanded to know why a company with massive market power and a track record of scandals should be trusted with such a far-reaching project, given the potential for fraud, abuse and criminal activity. </p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\" </p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said, \"The core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said. \"Arizonans will be more likely to be scammed\" using the currency, she said. </p><p>The litany of criticism came as Congress began two days of hearings on the currency planned by Facebook, to be called Libra. Meanwhile, a House Judiciary subcommittee extended its bipartisan investigation of the market power of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. </p><p>On the defensive from aggressive questioning, Marcus said the currency plan is a work in progress. \"We will take the time\" to ensure the network won't be open to use by criminals and illicit activity like money laundering and financial fraud. \"We hope that we'll avoid conflicts of interest. We have a lot of work to do,\" Marcus said. </p><p>He said the new venture would be headquartered in Switzerland, not to avoid oversight but because the country is a recognized international financial center. </p><p>The grilling followed a series of negative comments and warnings about the Libra plan in recent days from President Donald Trump, his treasury secretary and the head of the Federal Reserve. </p><p>But some senators emphasized the potential positive benefits of Facebook's plan, meant to bring money transacting at low cost to millions around the globe who don't have bank accounts. Facebook had its strong defenders of the project, too, on the panel. </p><p>\"To strangle this baby in the crib is wildly premature,\" said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.</p><p>In that vein, Marcus said Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.\" </p><p>The planned digital currency is to be a blend of multiple currencies, so that its value will fluctuate in any given local currency. Because Libra will be backed by a reserve, and because the group of companies managing it will encourage a competitive system of exchanges, the project leaders say, \"anyone with Libra has a high degree of assurance they can sell it for local (sovereign) currency based on an exchange rate.\" </p><p>Promising low fees, the new currency system could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud. </p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard, to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet\" subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from it, the company says. </p><p>Senators demanded to know exactly what that separation will entail. </p><p>\"Facebook isn't a company; it's a country,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. Kennedy and other conservative senators took the occasion to air long-standing grievances against Facebook, Twitter and Google for a perceived bias against conservative views. </p><p>Facebook's currency proposal has also faced heavy skepticism from the Trump administration. </p><p>Trump tweeted last week that the new currency, Libra, \"will have little standing or dependability.\" Both Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell have expressed serious concerns recently that Libra could be used for illicit activity. </p><p>The Treasury Department has \"very serious concerns that Libra could be misused by money launderers and terrorist financers,\" Mnuchin told reporters at the White House on Monday. \"This is indeed a national security issue.\" </p><p>Also Tuesday, across the Capitol in the House, the chairman of a Judiciary Committee panel investigating the market power of big tech companies said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed them to regulate themselves. That enabled companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said at the start of a hearing. </p><p>\"The internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship,\" he said. </p><p>As concerns have mounted over data privacy and market dominance of Big Tech, an increasing number of lawmakers from both parties are calling for tighter regulation of customarily free-wheeling companies or even breaking them up. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of the four major companies. </p><p>Executives of the companies, testifying at the Judiciary hearing, pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly yet vigorously against rivals in the marketplace. </p><p>And Google executive Karan Bhatia, at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on online bias, insisted that the company's search engine does not filter on the basis of political views. \"We surface the results that are most responsive,\" he said. \"We don't use political (markers) to blacklist or whitelist.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRBREV-1421263</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRBREV2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-K3V1-JBXT-N19M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279169</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Tribune Review Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tribune-Review (Greensburg, PA)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

You can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">sign up here</url> to receive it weekdays.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I\u2019ll make an easy prediction about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Wednesday\u2019s congressional hearing</url> into the power of big tech companies: Members of Congress will say dumb things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But please don\u2019t believe that these people are too old or too clueless to exercise effective oversight of tech superpowers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This idea, which is prevalent inside of tech companies, lets the tech giants off the hook for what they do. It shows a smug superiority that is not a good look. And it ignores that tech companies are built around software that is designed not to be understood by outsiders.</p><p>(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">Follow The Times\u2019s live coverage of the hearing.</url>)</p><p>After Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">first turns in the congressional hot seat</url> two years ago, people inside of Facebook thought that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">their boss had completely dominated those old fogies</url>. I\u2019ve heard this from Facebook executives. Their conclusions have worried me.</p><p>Members of Congress were fairly blamed for not understanding Facebook, but Zuckerberg didn\u2019t get enough blame for failing to make Facebook understood. He <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">dodged</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">occasionally misled</url> and essentially <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">tried to say as little as possible</url> about how Facebook works. At points, he didn\u2019t seem to know how Facebook worked, either.</p><p>Executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">a hearing last year</url> likewise seemed to intentionally deflect or dismiss what were generally excellent questions from lawmakers. (Seriously, I could have stared at C-SPAN for many more hours.) No one inside the big tech companies should have felt like they \u201cwon.\u201d</p><p>To be fair, that is part of the theatrics of all congressional hearings. Members of Congress grandstand and witnesses generally try to be inoffensive or run out the clock.</p><p>Yet it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to complete this set of hearings <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">and effectively address these central questions:</url> Are these big technology companies cheating to get a leg up over competitors? If so, does that hurt all of us and what \u2014 if anything \u2014 should the government do about it?</p><p>If members of Congress are confused about how to ask and answer these questions, that\u2019s partly because big tech companies are confusing.</p><p>Few people on the outside can truly understand how Amazon influences the prices of products we buy on its site or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">at other retailers</url>; assess fears that Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">funnels people to its own websites</url> or that Apple<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">steers people to its own apps</url>; or peer into Facebook\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">strategy to squash rivals in their cribs</url>. All of this is, by design, shrouded in secrecy and mystery.</p><p>Even many of the big tech companies now say that there needs to be more federal oversight and rules regarding areas like protecting elections and what constitutes appropriate speech online.</p><p>That means everyone \u2014 the tech companies, lawmakers and you and me \u2014 have a vested interest in getting under the hood of these big companies and seeing how they work.</p><p>This is a worthy goal \u2014 just as it was to assess the big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. Those banks also thought Congress was too clueless to question them effectively. Maybe so, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">regulation came anyway</url>.</p><p>What questions do you have about the hearing and the power of big tech? Send them to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ontech@nytimes.com\">ontech@nytimes.com</email>, and Shira will answer a selection in an upcoming newsletter. Please include your full name and location.</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for these distractions at the hearing</p><p>Me again, taking another moment to talk about Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 Sorry! Not sorry! \u2014 to explain what it is NOT about.</p><p>How big the tech companies are compared with the planet Jupiter: In his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">prepared testimony</url> for Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos cited competition from the grocery delivery service Instacart and mentioned the fast sales growth of Walmart\u2019s online shopping operation.</p><p>Sure, but online sales at those companies are a minuscule fraction of Amazon\u2019s. There will be a lot of slicing and dicing of data for misdirection like this. Please ignore.</p><p>The assessment of tech company power is not solely about their size or that of rivals. It is also about their behavior: Do big tech companies tilt the game to their advantage in a way that creates less competition?</p><p>Whether these sites show political bias: We\u2019ll hear a lot about this today, because some conservatives and Republican politicians argue that big tech companies habitually <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">squash information</url> reflecting conservative perspectives.</p><p>There\u2019s little credible reporting to support this, but a root cause of the concern is what I mentioned above: Outsiders can\u2019t see or assess the software that determines what information we see online. Black boxes naturally create suspicion.</p><p>How tech companies influence what information we\u2019re exposed to, and how they fairly police what people say online, are complicated topics worthy of debate. However, I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s a direct connection between those topics and the central question at Wednesday\u2019s hearing: Do big tech companies cheat to win?</p><p>How many American jobs they create: In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">a letter to Congress</url>, Google\u2019s chief executive touted a (delicious sounding) brownie shop in New York that drums up business from buying ads on Google. Bezos <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">talked up</url>Amazon training programs to pay for warehouse workers to move into higher-paying careers.</p><p>This is great! We want American companies to create jobs and contribute to economic growth. But companies that create jobs and support small businesses can still break the law by unfairly exercising their power and influence.</p><p>If you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/signup/OT\">please sign up here</url>.</p><p>Before we go \u2026</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>How to support alternatives to Big Tech: My colleague Brian X.

Meanwhile, Congress has quietly introduced a bill that could at least address the privacy concerns surrounding social networking giants like the aforementioned Facebook, as well asTwitter(NYSE:TWTR[6]). The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act of 2019, orACCESS Act, aims to mandate a way for individuals to transport their personal information from one social media account to another.Investors inthese tech companiesshould be worried. Although the proposal has only recently been unveiled and may or may not become a law, it's another glimpse into the mindset of regulators and lawmakers. If notthisbipartisan bill, one like it could eventually be squeezed through. </p><p>A seemingly small tweak could open the door to competition the world's top social media platforms and tech names have thus far been able to keep at bay.The ACCESS Act sets the stage for disruptionSenators Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) are the authors of the bill Warner says will make it \"easier for social media users to easily move their [personal] data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms.\" Perhaps more important in this case, \"start-ups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies.\"Social media users already have this option in a certain sense, but the proposed law will require web companies like Facebook and Google to develop a clear, uniform method -- with instructions -- for a newcomer to the social media landscape to retrieve and procure the user data about themselves that has been compiled and stored by those companies.The wording of the bill calls for a \"third-party custodial service\" to facilitate the data exchange. It also permits charging a fee for performing such a service, though it's conceivable that a new social networking platform would be willing to pay such a fee in exchange for gaining new users. Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee -- he said he is prepared to scale back plans to launch the digital coin Libra if necessary Photo: AFP / Nicholas Kamm Fertile ground for such a ruleIt hasn't taken the world's dominant internet companies long to realize they can leverage their size and complexity to prevent rivals from mounting a major affront. There were no laws to prevent the application of such leverage, as the internet itself is still a relatively young (even if overwhelmingly important) means of transacting business and sharing information. Consumers have also been mostly unaware of how much digital data is being gathered about them and then used on them by advertisers and others willing to pay for access to the detailed information.Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal arguably brought both long-brewing problems to a head.But unlike most such scandal-prodded movements, this one hasn't faded. It's continued to swell in popularity. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now found himself answering questions about user privacy as part of a congressional hearing more than once, including this week. Alphabet, Twitter, and Amazon executives have also sat in the same hot seat.In that same vein, consumers are largely on board with the regulatory scrutiny of so-called big tech. A survey performed by Trust Radius earlier this year found thatonly 29% of the respondents trusted Google. That's far better than Facebook's rating of a mere 5%. Apple and Amazon earned the trust of 27% and 25%, respectively. For perspective, the average level of consumer trust in companies observed by the study was a notably better 56%. More eye-opening is that more than 40% of respondents indicated they didn't trustanyof the big four tech names.The reason for the distrust? A separate study done by Dentsu found that roughly two-thirds of distrust in tech companies stemmed from misuse of personal data.Sooner than later, competition is comingAgain, it's only a proposed bill at this time and far from becoming law. Similar privacy-minded and portability measures have been put on the table before and ultimately been rejected, most before they were ever put into bill form.Those efforts weren't made in an environment like the current one though. TheFTCandthe DOJandconsumersandlawmakers appear to have had enough, even without knowing exactly what they've had enough of. Such legal and regulatory efforts don't appear to be going away.Regardless of when it may finally take shape, it was Charlotte Slaiman -- policy counsel for digital-rights advocacy group Public Knowledge -- that arguably lays out the full extent of the threat to the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and others. She explains \"It's really hard in today's environment for a company that would rely on this thing that doesn't exist yet to survive without it for a while. So I think that if we are able to have interoperability required, then innovators will know if you come up with a new start-up that is based on this system, you will have the opportunity for success.\"It's that potential success of a newcomer prompting the present giants of social media to slow-walk and stall the ACCESS Act and other akin proposals.

Meanwhile, Congress has quietly introduced a bill that could at least address the privacy concerns surrounding social networking giants like the aforementioned Facebook, as well as\u00a0Twitter\u00a0(NYSE:(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/?p=TWTR\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/?p=TWTR</url>) TWTR ). The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act of 2019, or\u00a0ACCESS Act, aims to mandate a way for individuals to transport their personal information from one social media account to another.</p><p>Investors in\u00a0these tech companies\u00a0should be worried. Although the proposal has only recently been unveiled and may or may not become a law, it's another glimpse into the mindset of regulators and lawmakers. If not\u00a0this\u00a0bipartisan bill, one like it could eventually be squeezed through. A seemingly small tweak could open the door to competition the world's top social media platforms and tech names have thus far been able to keep at bay.</p><p>The ACCESS Act sets the stage for disruption</p><p>Senators Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) are the authors of the bill Warner says will make it \"easier for social media users to easily move their [personal] data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms.\" Perhaps more important in this case, \"start-ups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies.\"</p><p>Social media users already have this option in a certain sense, but the proposed law will require web companies like Facebook and Google to develop a clear, uniform method -- with instructions -- for a newcomer to the social media landscape to retrieve and procure the user data about themselves that has been compiled and stored by those companies.</p><p>The wording of the bill calls for a \"third-party custodial service\" to facilitate the data exchange. It also permits charging a fee for performing such a service, though it's conceivable that a new social networking platform would be willing to pay such a fee in exchange for gaining new users.</p><p>Fertile ground for such a rule</p><p>It hasn't taken the world's dominant internet companies long to realize they can leverage their size and complexity to prevent rivals from mounting a major affront. There were no laws to prevent the application of such leverage, as the internet itself is still a relatively young (even if overwhelmingly important) means of transacting business and sharing information. Consumers have also been mostly unaware of how much digital data is being gathered about them and then used on them by advertisers and others willing to pay for access to the detailed information.\u00a0Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal arguably brought both long-brewing problems to a head.</p><p>But unlike most such scandal-prodded movements, this one hasn't faded. It's continued to swell in popularity. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now found himself answering questions about user privacy as part of a congressional hearing more than once, including this week. Alphabet, Twitter, and Amazon executives have also sat in the same hot seat.</p><p>In that same vein, consumers are largely on board with the regulatory scrutiny of so-called big tech. A survey performed by Trust Radius earlier this year found that\u00a0only 29% of the respondents trusted Google. That's far better than Facebook's rating of a mere 5%. Apple and Amazon earned the trust of 27% and 25%, respectively. For perspective, the average level of consumer trust in companies observed by the study was a notably better 56%. More eye-opening is that more than 40% of respondents indicated they didn't trust\u00a0any\u00a0of the big four tech names.</p><p>The reason for the distrust? A separate study done by Dentsu found that roughly two-thirds of distrust in tech companies stemmed from misuse of personal data.</p><p>Sooner than later, competition is coming</p><p>Again, it's only a proposed bill at this time and far from becoming law. Similar privacy-minded and portability measures have been put on the table before and ultimately been rejected, most before they were ever put into bill form.</p><p>Those efforts weren't made in an environment like the current one though. The\u00a0FTC\u00a0and\u00a0the DOJ\u00a0and\u00a0consumers\u00a0and\u00a0lawmakers appear to have had enough, even without knowing exactly what they've had enough of. Such legal and regulatory efforts don't appear to be going away.</p><p>Regardless of when it may finally take shape, it was Charlotte Slaiman -- policy counsel for digital-rights advocacy group Public Knowledge -- that arguably lays out the full extent of the threat to the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and others. She explains \"It's really hard in today's environment for a company that would rely on this thing that doesn't exist yet to survive without it for a while. So I think that if we are able to have interoperability required, then innovators will know if you come up with a new start-up that is based on this system, you will have the opportunity for success.\"</p><p>It's that potential success of a newcomer prompting the present giants of social media to slow-walk and stall the ACCESS Act and other akin proposals. It's apt to come at their expense.</p><p>John Mackey, CEO of Whole FoodsMarket, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Meanwhile, Congress has quietly introduced a bill that could at least address the privacy concerns surrounding social networking giants like the aforementioned Facebook, as well as\u00a0Twitter\u00a0(NYSE:(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/?p=TWTR\">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/?p=TWTR</url>) TWTR ). The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act of 2019, or\u00a0ACCESS Act, aims to mandate a way for individuals to transport their personal information from one social media account to another.</p><p>Investors in\u00a0these tech companies\u00a0should be worried. Although the proposal has only recently been unveiled and may or may not become a law, it's another glimpse into the mindset of regulators and lawmakers. If not\u00a0this\u00a0bipartisan bill, one like it could eventually be squeezed through. A seemingly small tweak could open the door to competition the world's top social media platforms and tech names have thus far been able to keep at bay.</p><p>The ACCESS Act sets the stage for disruption</p><p>Senators Mark Warner (D-Virginia), Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut), and Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) are the authors of the bill Warner says will make it \"easier for social media users to easily move their [personal] data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms.\" Perhaps more important in this case, \"start-ups will be able to compete on equal terms with the biggest social media companies.\"</p><p>Social media users already have this option in a certain sense, but the proposed law will require web companies like Facebook and Google to develop a clear, uniform method -- with instructions -- for a newcomer to the social media landscape to retrieve and procure the user data about themselves that has been compiled and stored by those companies.</p><p>The wording of the bill calls for a \"third-party custodial service\" to facilitate the data exchange. It also permits charging a fee for performing such a service, though it's conceivable that a new social networking platform would be willing to pay such a fee in exchange for gaining new users.</p><p>Fertile ground for such a rule</p><p>It hasn't taken the world's dominant internet companies long to realize they can leverage their size and complexity to prevent rivals from mounting a major affront. There were no laws to prevent the application of such leverage, as the internet itself is still a relatively young (even if overwhelmingly important) means of transacting business and sharing information. Consumers have also been mostly unaware of how much digital data is being gathered about them and then used on them by advertisers and others willing to pay for access to the detailed information.\u00a0Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal arguably brought both long-brewing problems to a head.</p><p>But unlike most such scandal-prodded movements, this one hasn't faded. It's continued to swell in popularity. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has now found himself answering questions about user privacy as part of a congressional hearing more than once, including this week. Alphabet, Twitter, and Amazon executives have also sat in the same hot seat.</p><p>In that same vein, consumers are largely on board with the regulatory scrutiny of so-called big tech. A survey performed by Trust Radius earlier this year found that\u00a0only 29% of the respondents trusted Google. That's far better than Facebook's rating of a mere 5%. Apple and Amazon earned the trust of 27% and 25%, respectively. For perspective, the average level of consumer trust in companies observed by the study was a notably better 56%. More eye-opening is that more than 40% of respondents indicated they didn't trust\u00a0any\u00a0of the big four tech names.</p><p>The reason for the distrust? A separate study done by Dentsu found that roughly two-thirds of distrust in tech companies stemmed from misuse of personal data.</p><p>Sooner than later, competition is coming</p><p>Again, it's only a proposed bill at this time and far from becoming law. Similar privacy-minded and portability measures have been put on the table before and ultimately been rejected, most before they were ever put into bill form.</p><p>Those efforts weren't made in an environment like the current one though. The\u00a0FTC\u00a0and\u00a0the DOJ\u00a0and\u00a0consumers\u00a0and\u00a0lawmakers appear to have had enough, even without knowing exactly what they've had enough of. Such legal and regulatory efforts don't appear to be going away.</p><p>Regardless of when it may finally take shape, it was Charlotte Slaiman -- policy counsel for digital-rights advocacy group Public Knowledge -- that arguably lays out the full extent of the threat to the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and others. She explains \"It's really hard in today's environment for a company that would rely on this thing that doesn't exist yet to survive without it for a while. So I think that if we are able to have interoperability required, then innovators will know if you come up with a new start-up that is based on this system, you will have the opportunity for success.\"</p><p>It's that potential success of a newcomer prompting the present giants of social media to slow-walk and stall the ACCESS Act and other akin proposals. It's apt to come at their expense.</p><p>John Mackey, CEO of Whole FoodsMarket, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

When a \"conversation\" does occur, it tends to be superficial at best, and consumers pretty consistently aren't invited to the table. </p><p>Case in point: on September 26, the Senate Commerce Committee will be holding a hearing[2] entitled \"Examining Safeguards for Consumer Data Privacy.\" One of the motivating reasons for this hearing, at least according to Senator John Thune, was because \"consumers deserve clear answers\" on privacy:\"Consumers deserve clear answers and standards on data privacy protection,' said Thune. 'This hearing will provide leading technology companies and internet service providers an opportunity to explain their approaches to privacy, how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation.\"It's odd then, that not a single consumer or consumer advocacy group was invited to appear at said hearing, according to the EFF[3]:\"...the Committee is seeking only the testimony of big tech and Internet access corporations: Amazon, Apple, AT...Charter Communications, Google, and Twitter. Some of these companies have spent heavily to oppose consumer privacy legislation and have never supported consumer privacy laws. They know policymakers are considering new privacy protections, and are likely to view this hearing as a chance to encourage Congress to adopt the weakest privacy protections possible\u2014and eviscerate stronger state protections at the same time.\"Regardless of whether you think new privacy rules are necessary, it goes without saying that consumers should have some voice in the process. Instead, Congress pretty clearly prefers a round table where companies that have spent the better part of the last decade trying to avoid meaningful privacy protections get to dictate the course and cadence of the conversation. AT...hinks it's a good idea to charge consumers more to protect their own privacy[4]. Google and Facebook, meanwhile, have been working in concert with the telecom sector[5] to scuttle state-level efforts on privacy, no matter what they look like. Like net neutrality, the Trump era attack on federal consumer protections (like the GOP's dismantling of modest FCC broadband privacy rules[6] last year) has opened the door to numerous states rushing to fill the oversight vacuum. The end result, as we've seen in California[7], tends to be rushed bills that over-reach (as opposed to the FCC's broadband privacy rules, which took years to craft). All the while, the tech press adores tap dancing around the fact that this current administration and Congressional majority couldn't care less about meaningful consumer protections. Yes, some of these state efforts are terrible[8]. And yes, it would be easy for federal rules to be equally bad. Especially when the crafting process is largely being driven by cross-industry gamesmanship (the telecom industry, for example, has covertly undermined its alliance with Silicon Valley and is pushing for rules that screw over their video ad competitors like Google[9], but leave giant ISPs free to do as they wish). That said, it shouldn't be assumed that meaningful privacy protections are impossible, especially given the Congressional status quo shake up that may be just over the horizon. Another truth the tech press enjoys tap dancing around is the fact that none of the companies invited to this round table want serious privacy rules impacting them, even if they're well-crafted. Informed, educated, empowered consumers are more likely to opt-out of data collection and monetization, and you'd be hard pressed to find any major company that's eager to lose billions as these consumers dodge being tracked and sold to. Without consumer groups at the table, these are the kind of facts that tend to get lost in the shuffle, and the entire conversation tends to shift to why privacy rules kill innovation and aren't necessary, and not what real privacy consumer protections might look like. Again, because as it stands now, none of the folks at this hearing are actually interested in real rules that protect consumers. They're interested in either no rules at all, or flimsy federal rules that pre-empt more meaningful state-level protections. And many of the politicians at this hearing aren't interested in privacy at all, they're simply eager to hammer Silicon Valley over perceived, frequently hallucinated, partisan censhorship claims[10] that have nothing to do with privacy. Sure, maybe meaningful privacy protections are impossible, either due to government's failure to adapt to quickly changing markets, or outright corruption. But by omitting consumer groups from the conversation, it's being made abundantly clear that this isn't a serious effort one way or another, with the end result being more of an echo chamber than any meaningful policy discussion.Permalink[11] | Comments[12] | Email This Story[13] [ 1]: <url

And the answers they gave weren't pretty. The word both Republicans and Democrats used to describe their corporations was dominance, and as members unspooled the evidence they had collected in an investigation over the past year, it's easy to see why.</p><p>Almost any moment of the four-hour hearing offered a stunning illustration of the extent of the bad behaviour by these corporations. Take Amazon, whose CEO, Bezos, often seemed off-balance and unaware of his corporation's own practices.

We watched every second of the more than five and a half hours of Congress' grilling of some of the richest men in the world so you wouldn't have to.  Let's start with the ending. House Antitrust Committee Chairman David Cicilline closed today's hearing with the following statement: This hearing has made one fact clear to me: these companies as they exist today have monopoly power. </p><p>Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable. We need to ensure the antitrust laws first written more than a century ago work in the digital age. Now that we've got that bit of cogent observation out of the way, let's get onto the good, the bad, and the GOP. The hearing opened with a statement from Chairman Cicilline as well. It was at this point we noticed he was wearing an Apple watch.His main point: 'It is possible these companies will emerge from this crisis even more consolidated than before.' Cicilline stated that big tech's business methodology was built to discourage entrepreneurship and hurt jobs, he continued 'simply put, they have too much power.' The hearing was organized so that committee members would each have five minutes to speak and then panel members would take turns asking questions. Due to the pandemic, Congresspersons were required to wear masks unless they had the floor. This would become a point of annoyance forRepresentative Jim Jordan of the GOP throughout the proceedings. Republican Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner spoke up next. Did you know he owns some $98,000 in stocks of the four companies[1] represented by their CEOs at the hearing? As the first GOP member to speak in the antitrust hearing he immediately turned the session into a referendum on right wing conspiracy theories concerning the alleged censorship of Conservative voices on social media. Sensenbrenner did at least try to tie his blatant derailing of an antitrust hearing to consumer concerns, adding 'conservatives are consumers too, and they need the protection of the antitrust laws.' Next up was Rep. Jerry Nadler, a democrat who was attending the hearing remotely, as were all four big tech CEOs. He weighed in with the entire premise of Congress' concerns over big tech's antitrust activities: It is effectively impossible to use the internet in one way or the other without using the services of these four companies. Nadler went on to make the comparison between big tech founders and robber barons of the rail industry. And then Jim Jordan got his five minutes. Apparently nobody told Mr. Jordan that this was an antitrust hearing because he wasn't wasting a moment of his time discussing the bipartisan concerns surrounding the potential monopoly status of the four companies represented. Instead, he decided the proceedings should revolve around conspiracy theories. He began with: I'll just cut to the chase, big tech's out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch, that's a fact. He cites the downranking of Breitbart (just caught peddling COVID-19 misinformation[2] in a press conference and The Federalist (an outlet that published an article saying people should have 'chicken pox parties[3]' for COVID-19) as examples of this bias and says 'if it doesn't end, there has to be consequences.' Jordan then refused to cede the floor as Chairman Cicilline demandedorder - someone actually yelled 'put your mask on' several times before Jordan finally went quiet. And then there was the eerie moment when four of the richest men on the planet raise there hands to swear in remotely via conference call to an official Congressional hearing.The four tech CEOs, Google's Sundar Pichai, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Apple's Tim Cook, all took a few moments to honor the late Congressman John Lewis and to wax nostalgic about all the good their companies do. And then it was time for questions. Here we'll list the most interesting exchanges and moments throughout the entirety of the event. Representative Cicilline kicked off the question portion with a doozy: Cicilline: 'Why does Google steal content from honest businesses?' Pichai: 'With respect, I disagree with that characterization we see many businesses thrive -' Cicilline: 'Isn't there a fundamental conflict of interest [between Google's ad services and its website rankings]? Pichai: 'We've always focused on providing users with the most relevant content. We show ads for only a small subset of queries.' Cicilline, referring to Google getting caught stealing reviews from Yelp[4]: 'The choice Google gave Yelp was let us steal your content or disappear from the web.' Pichai: 'I don't believe that happens' Cicilline: 'Did Google ever use its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats?' Pichai: 'We're really focused on improving our products.' Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner took the helm next and, like his GOP counterpart Jim Jordan, immediately abandoned the notion that this was an antitrust hearing, and expounded on the conspiracy theory that big tech willfully silences Conservatives. Speaking to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, he asked: After hearing Mr Jordan give a long line of censorship of conservative view points Exactly what are your standards in, quote, 'filtering out political speech that maybe some people out there don't agree with?' Zuckerberg: 'Our goal is to offer a platform for all ideas.' Sensenbrenner: 'It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up, the efficacy of hydroxycholoroquine, now I wouldn't take it myself, but there's still a debate' Zuckerberg: First, to be clear I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter we do prohibit content that will lead to harm and stating that there's a proven cure for COVID when there is in fact none might encourage someone to go take something that might have adverse effects, so we take that down. We do not take down discussions around trials of drugs or people who say they think something will work. Sensenbrenner: 'Wouldn't that be up to someone else to say here's what the facts are?' Zuckerberg: 'We do not want to become the arbiters of truth on specific claims, if someone is going to go out and say that hydroxycholoriquine is proven to cure COVID when in fact it has not been proven to cure COVID we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk of harm.' Nadler then got his five minutes, which went like this: Nadler: 'You bought Instagram' Zuckerberg: 'Yep.' Nadler: 'What did you mean when you [previous to purchasing it] described Instagram as a threat?' Zuckerberg: 'At the time, there was a small but growing field in the space of mobile photos and camera apps they were a competitor, I've been clear about that.' Nadler: 'Merger and acquisitions that buy off potential competitors to neutralize competitors is against antitrust laws. In your own words you purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitive threat, if this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction, why shouldn't Instagram now be broken off into a separate company?' Zuckerberg: 'Well, congressman I think the FTC had all these documents and reviewed this and unanimously voted at the time not to challenge the acquisition. I think with hindsight it probably looks obvious that Instagram would have reached the scale that it has today, but at the time it wasn't obvious it was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed.' At the end of Nadler's time, Cicilline took a moment to remind everyone that 'the failures of the FTC in 2012 of course do not alleviate the antitrust challenges that the chairman described.' Then it was time for Congressman Ken Buck who began with a message on how capitalism makes America great. He went on to echo other Republicans by saying, 'I do not believe big is necessarily bad.' Buck then painted Google as a company in bed with the Chinese military and suggested that, after getting caught red handed stealing from music company Genius[5], that the company finds itself beyond reproach. Buck: 'Do you think that Google could get away with following China's corporate espionage playbook [by stealing from Genius] if you didn't have a monopolistic advantage in the market?' Pichai: 'Congressman, I want to be able to address the important concerns you raised. First of all we are proud to support the US government we have a very limited presence in China. And with respect to music, we license content there. In fact we license content from other companies. So this is a dispute between Genius and other companies.' Hank Johnson, a democrat from Georgia, took his five minutes to discuss Apple's App Store, alleging it was a non-competitive walled-garden. Johnson: 'Apple is the sole decision maker as to whether an app is made available to Apple users.' Cook: 'Yes.' Johnson: 'We've heard concerns that rules governing the app store development process are not made available to app developers .. they're made up as you go along.' Cook: 'We treat every developer the same, we have open and transparent rules.' Johnson: 'Some developers are favored over others, isn't that correct?' Cook: 'That is not correct.' Cook also responded to the allegation that the app market wasn't a competitive on for Apple: 'It's so competitive, I'd describe it as a street fight in the mobile phone business.' Then came Matt Gaetz, the Republican from Florida. As you can guess, his concerns were on everything but antitrust concerns. Gaetz: 'Project Maven[6] Did you weigh the input from your employees when making the decision to abandon that project with the US military?' Pichai: 'We are deeply committed to supporting the military and the US government. We do take our employees' input into account.' Gaetz: 'Will you take the pledge that google will not adopt the bigoted anti-police policy that is requested in the most recent [employee] letter?' Pichai: 'We have a long track record of working with law enforcement when it is supported by due process and the law.' Gaetz: 'I understand the history, I'm asking about the future.' Pichai: 'We are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement in a way that's consistent with due process and the law in the US.' Gaetz: 'Then why are you working with the Chinese military?' Pichai: 'We are not working with the Chinese military, it's absolutely false.' Congressman Jamie Raskin took the floor next. Despite being a Democrat, Raskin apparently lost the thread too and began riffing on the presidential elections instead of discussing antitrust concerns. Raskin: 'The proliferation of fake Facebook accounts was a key tool in the strategy of Russian interference in the election of 2016, American law enforcement, the Senate, and the House have all found that Vladmir Putin engaged in a sweeping and systematic campaign to undermine American democracy in 2016 and to work for a victory for Donald Trump is there nothing that can be done about the use of Facebook to engender racial division?' Zuckerberg: 'Since 2016 there have been a lot of steps we've taken to protect the integrity of elections. We've hired more than 30,000 people to work on safety and security. We've built up the AI systems to find harmful content including more than 50 different networks of coordinated inauthentic behavior, basically nation-states trying to interfere in elections.' When Raskin was done asking about things not related to antitrust regulations, it was time for Congressman Kelly Armstrong to bring things back on track. Instead he grilled Pichai about privacy concerns related to the police use of location data. To be fair there were some concerns about GDPR, but those were a bit misplaced in the forum as well. Just when all hope that Congress would hold themselves to the task of discussing antitrust issues seemed lost, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal got her five minutes and saved the stream. Jayapal: 'Does Amazon ever access and use third-party seller data when making business decisions?' Bezos: 'I can't answer that question yes or no. What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business. But I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated.' Jayapal: 'Do category managers have access to non-public data about 3rd party businesses?' Bezos: 'Here's what I can tell you: we do have certain safeguards in place, we train people on the policy and we expect people to follow that policy the fact that we have a policy is voluntary if we found that someone violated it we would take action.' The respite from non-related issues was brief however, as GOP Congressman Steube, another Florida Republican, decided to veer off the rails again. Stuebe, after telling a story about how he couldn't find positive coverage of himself on Google: I Googled [far-right website] 'Gateway Pundit,' it didn't show up on the first page and it didn't show up on the second page. Stuebe: 'Was there anything done at Google between a couple months ago and you appearing today that's changed your approach to silencing conservative websites?' Pichai: 'We approach our work with a deep sense of responsibility in a non-partisan way I believe on our platforms, including YouTube, there are more conservative voices than ever before and we believe in freedom of expression.' Stuebe: 'What assurances can you give me that any bias among your employees isn't influencing your spam folder algorithms?' Pichai: 'There's nothing in the algorithm that has anything to do with political ideology.' And, a couple of questioners later, Jim Jordan made his triumphant return to not discussing antitrust issues at the hearing: Jordan: 'Mr. Pichai is Google going to tailor its features to help Joe Biden in the 2020 election?' Pichai: 'We approach our work, you know we support both campaigns today we think political ads is an important part of free speech in democratic societies, you know we engage with campaigns according to law and we approach our work in a nonpartisan way.' Jordan: 'It was a yes or no question, can you assure Americans today you won't help Joe Biden in the upcoming election?' Pichai: 'You know, we support work that campaigns do. We won't do any work to tilt things one way or another, it's against our core values. We'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way.' Congresswoman Mary Scanlon had the mic next after Jordan and she sent a zinger his way: I'll direct our attention back to antitrust laws rather than fringe conspiracy theories This caused a bit of a hissy fit from Jordan. He once again had to be yelled at to put his mask back on and cede the floor. Tsk tsk. Scanlon brought the hearing back around immediately by questioning Amazon about Diapers.com:In 2009, your team viewed Diapers.com as Amazon's largest and fastest growing competitor for diapers. One of Amazon's top executives said that Diapers.com keeps the pressure on pricing on us, and strong competition from Diapers.com meant that amazon was having to work harder and harder so that customers didn't pick Diapers.com over Amazon. And the customers we're talking about were hard-working families, single parents with babies and young children. Now because Diapers.com was so successful Amazon saw it as a threat. in 2010 amazon hatched a plot to go after Diapers.com and take it out in one month Amazon was willing to bleed over 200 million dollars in diaper profit losses. How much money was Amazon willing to lose in this campaign against Diapers.com?'Bezos: 'I don't know the direct answer to your question.. what I can tell you is that the idea of using diapers and products like that to attract new customers with new families is a very traditional idea.' Scanlon: 'Your own docs make clear that the campaign against Diapers.com worked and within a few months it was struggling and that's when Amazon bought it. After Amazon cut promotions and the steep discounts it used to lure customers away from Diapers.com and then increased the prices of diapers for new moms and dads. Mr. Bezos, did you personally sign off on the plan to raise prices after Amazon eliminated its competition?' Bezos: 'I don't remember that at all. What I remember is that we match competitor prices. I believe we followed Diapers.com. I can also tell you after we -' Scanlon, cutting Bezos off: 'How would customers, especially single moms and families, how would they benefit by the prices being driven up now you've eliminated your competitor?' Bezos: 'Well, I don't agree, with great respect, I don't agree with the premise. At the same time you have to recognize in context, diapers is a very large product category sold in many, many places.' Scanlon: 'Right, but this is the online diaper market. the evidence we've collected suggests that the predatory practices weren't unique here.' At this point in the hearing, things got a little dull. A few more congresspersons asked some softball questions, but things didn't pick back up again until Congresswoman Jayapal got the mic back in round two of questioning. Jayapal, to Zuckerberg: 'Do you copy your competitors?' Zuckerberg: 'We've certainly adapted features that others had a lead in, as have others copied and adapted features that we lead in.' Jayapal: 'Has Facebook ever threatened to clone the products of another company while also attempting to acquire that company?' Zuckerberg: 'No.' Jayapal: 'Facebook was developing a product similar to Instagram prior to its acquisition is that correct?' Zuckerberg: 'Yes.' Jayapal: 'Did you ever use this very similar 'Facebook Camera' product to threaten Instagram's founder, Kevin Systrom?' Zuckerberg: 'I'm not sure what you would mean by 'threaten.' I think it was public that we were building a camera app at the time. That was a well-documented thing.' Jayapal: 'In a chat, you told Mr. Systrom that Facebook was quote 'developing our own photo strategy so how we engage now will also determine how much we're partners versus competitors down the line.' And Instagram's founder seemed to think that was a threat, he confided in an investor at the time that he feared you would go into quote 'destroy mode' if he didn't sell Instagram to you. Were there any other companies that you used this same tactic with?' Zuckerberg: 'I want to respectfully disagree with your interpretation. It was clear that this was a space that we were going to compete in one way or another, I don't view those conversations as a threat in any way.' Jayapal: 'Did you warn Evan Spiegel, the founder of Snapchat, that Facebook was in the process of cloning the features of his company while also attempting to buy Snapchat?' Zuckerberg: I don't remember those specific conversations, but that was also an area where it was very clear we were going to be building something. People want to be able to communicate privately, they want to be able to communicate with all their friends at once.' Jayapal then used the rest of her time for what was clearly the hearing's mic drop moment:When the dominant platform threatens its potential rivals, that should not be a normal business practice. Facebook is a case study, in my opinion, in monopoly power because your company harvests and monetizes our data and then your company uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy and acquire and kill rivals. You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors, and to ensure that you always get your way. These tactics reinforce Facebook's dominance, which you then use in increasingly destructive ways so Facebook's very model makes it impossible for new companies to flourish separately, and that harms our democracy, it harms mom and pop stores, and it harms consumers.Mr. Buck came back after that with the yet another on-topic argument, the GOP's third by this point more than mid-way through the hearing: PopSockets CEO and inventor David Barnett detailed how Amazon allowed counterfeit products to appear on Amazon's marketplace ahead of PopSocket's products. Mr. Barnett told CNBC that PopSockets found at least 1,000 counterfeit products for sale on Amazon's marketplace which Amazon allegedly failed to remedy until PopSockets agreed to a nearly 2 million dollar marketing deal with Amazon. Bezos would answer that concern later in the hearing because, unfortunately, Buck then decided to veer away from antitrust concerns and solicit promises from all four CEOs they'd 'certify here today that your company does not use and will never use slave labor.' All four did so without hesitation. Congressman Raskin put things back in order with a quick, razor-sharp question: Does Amazon price the Echo device below cost? Bezos: 'Not its list price, but it's often on promotion and sometimes when it's on promotion it's below cost, yes.' Raskin went on to point out that Amazon's pricing of the Echo effectively made it impossible for competitors to profit. Bezos responded by pointing out that he wants to get other smart assistants on Echo devices. And then Gaetz was back to express his incredulity that fine Conservative news outlets were being downranked or censored by big tech. Here's the outlets he mentioned specifically:And speaking of fake news, Congressman Stuebe's second round of questioning was even less-related to antitrust issues than his first. Stuebe: 'How can doctors giving their opinion on COVID-19.. violate YouTube's guidelines?' Pichai: 'We believe in freedom of expression and there is a lot of debate on YouTube for effective ways to deal with COVID; during a pandemic we look to local health authorities \u2014 in this case it would be the CDC\u2014 to look for guidelines around misinformation; in this case it could cause harm in the real world. For example, if there are aspects of a video, and if it explicitly states something could be a proven cure and that doesn't meet CDC guidelines, we would remove it.' Next up, a pair of congressional inquisitors managed to stay on topic to ask Jeff Bezos some questions about counterfeits - 'why isn't Amazon responsible for stopping counterfeits on its platform?' - and whether Amazon engages in making knock-offs itself. Bezos gave a non-answer that simply agreed counterfeiting was a problem and said Amazon was dedicating resources to fixing it. Normalcy wouldn't last, because Jim Jordan returned and immediately gave his time to Congressman Gaetz. Gaetz is all in on the alleged video evidence showing Facebook's bias against Conservatives. The evidence comes from Project Veritas[7] - a club of far-right conservative internet users who try to convince people who work for big tech to say bad things about Conservatives on camera. Check it out for yourself here on Project Veritas' own website[8]. Gaetz to Zuckerberg: 'The culture you lead within Facebook is one that disadvantages Conservatives and leads to content manipulation.' Zuckerberg: 'I'm somewhat familiar with the concerns that they've raised we aim to be a platform for all ideas I certainly do not want our platforms to be run in a way that has any ideological bias when people raise concerns like that we do look into them if the behavior that they cited was true then that would be unacceptable in our operation.' Then Gaetz basically breaks Palmer Luckey's NDA[9] with Facebook by asking Zuckerberg why he fired Luckey. Zuckerberg didn't answer, saying it wasn't appropriate to discuss in public. Then Gaetz revealed that, due to the NDA, Luckey can only talk to government representatives about why he was fired, adding 'and I'm a government representative.' This was a weird moment where it appeared Gaetz was trying to pull off a 'gotcha.' At this point, apparently, the Congresspersons were just going to talk about whatever came to mind, antitrust hearing be damned. Chairman Cicille decided it was time to talk about public safety and harmful content. Cicille: 'Do you agree that there are limits to harmful speech.. that are particularly important when it comes to the health and safety of the public?' Zuckerberg: 'I certainly do. And I actually think that our policies go further than just limiting those types of those things. ' Cicille: 'You agree you have a responsibility to remove harmful lies from your platform, correct?' Zuckerberg: 'I think we have a responsibility to limit the spread of content that may be harmful.' Cicille: 'Doesn't that suggest that with all of your policies in place, that your platform is so big that you can't contain deadly content?' Zuckerberg: 'I don't think so. I think we have, on COVID information in particular, a relatively good track record.' Then, ugh, it was Gaetz again. Distancing himself even further from the antitrust aspects of the hearing, he ranted about the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), An organization that researches hate and extremism in the US. Gaetz says the SPLC traffics in hate because it declares some Catholic, Jewish, and Christian organizations 'extremist' over their anti-LGBTQPIA+ views. Any organization dedicated to promoting the bigoted view that a government should not give a marriage license to non-heterosexual couples is usually considered an extremist hate group by the SPLC. That's also why Dr. Ben Carson, a member of Congress, is on the list as well - this will be relevant soon. Mr Stuebe makes another appearance to ask all four CEOs if they think China steals from US companies. Zuckerberg's response, in context, made me laugh. Stuebe: 'Do you believe that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies?' Cook (I'd forgotten Tim Cook was there by this point): 'I don't know of specific cases where we have been stolen from.' Pichai: 'I have no first-hand knowledge of any information stolen from Google.' Zuckerberg: 'I think it's well-documented that the Chinese government steals technology from American companies.' Bezos: 'I have heard many reports of it.' And then, I kid you not, Stuebe yielded the floor to Gaetz again. Gaetz, to Zuckerberg: 'What is a digital land grab?' Yes, you read that right. Gaetz asked a question related to antitrust. Zuckerberg gave a non-answer, but let the record show that it happened. It wouldn't last long. Two speakers later and Gaetz gets yet another turn. Gaetz, to Jeff Bezos: 'You don't believe Dr. Ben Carson is an extremist do you?' Bezos: 'No Sir, I don't.' Pichai responds the same way. The next interesting portion of the hearing wouldn't come until Jim Jordan spoke again a few congresspersons later. He went on a long, wayward rant about cancel culture and the First Amendment that hilariously had nothing to do with people being canceled of the First Amendment. He cited Drew Brees and James Harden, two athletes who'd been criticized by fans over recent statements they'd made. These men were not canceled, they remain millionaire athletes with legions of adoring fans. They also did not have their First Amendment infringed upon because they weren't arrested, fined, censored, or prohibited from making their statements. The final point of interest, and perhaps the best question of the whole 5  hour long crapfest was Congresswoman Lucy McBath getting Jeff Bezos to admit that Amazon probably sells stolen goods. McBath: 'Are stolen goods sold on Amazon?' Bezos: 'Not to the best of my knowledge. There's over a million sellers on Amazon so I'm sure that it has happened.' After that and the aforementioned closing comments, the hearing was thankfully over.

So let s take the regulation off the table. </p><p>While both <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\"> Joe Biden </url></emphasis> and<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266387743996870656\"> Trump </url> have called for Section 230 to be revoked, the witnesses agreed that it should be changed rather than repealed right away.</p><p> We really do need 230,  said George Washington University professor <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spencer Overton</emphasis>.  We want Black Lives Matter, we want the tea party, we want a variety of grassroots organizations to be able to participate and post their material without fear that the platforms feel like they re going to be sued. </p><p>1275630187162501120 12756004810968064001275789809496326146</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-707787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606V-PRP1-JBNW-33PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>An afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed \"de facto immunity\" thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts - including from one another - and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to \"directly compete\" with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. \"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,\" he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without \"reducing the focus on consumer welfare.\" She warned against \"drastic\" steps such as breakups that carry \"serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier in the day, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown\u00a0of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8520315/congress-grills-big-tech-companies-competition-money-power?utm_source=GALE&amp;utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=Congress+Grills+Big+Tech+Companies+Over+Competition%2C+Money+and+Power\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BILLBD-8520315</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BILLBD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKK-YD11-JC8J-40FN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">5545</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"961\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Prometheus Global Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Billboard</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30084\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>ONLINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>A Tuesday afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed \"de facto immunity\" thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts -- including from one another -- and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest -- Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp -- and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to \"directly compete\" with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. \"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,\" he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without \"reducing the focus on consumer welfare.\" She warned against \"drastic\" steps such as breakups that carry \"serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p>Marcus returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to face grilling from House lawmakers.</p><p>------</p><p>AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this article from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKK-Y5K1-JBP6-R2HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"988\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.An afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. </p><p>Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed 'de facto immunity' thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a 'startup kill zone' that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.AdvertisingA panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts \u2014 including from one another \u2014 and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest \u2014 Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.'We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,' Neguse said.The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was 'not familiar' with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was 'not familiar' with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.AdvertisingSutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to 'directly compete' with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. 'Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,' he said.Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising. Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without 'reducing the focus on consumer welfare.' She warned against 'drastic' steps such as breakups that carry 'serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.'Earlier in the day, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. 'Facebook is dangerous,' asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, 'Facebook has burned down the house over and over,' he told Marcus. 'Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?'Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said 'the core issue here is trust.' Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.___AP business writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this article from Washington, D.C.

That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts - including from one another - and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to \"directly compete\" with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. \"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,\" he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without \"reducing the focus on consumer welfare.\" She warned against \"drastic\" steps such as breakups that carry \"serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p>Marcus returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to face grilling from House lawmakers.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this article from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APINTL-dad8880720c8403ab5418dfd8fbf42c5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APINTL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-K301-JC65-53R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138211</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"986\"/><timeReceived>3:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press International</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>A Tuesday afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed \"de facto immunity\" thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts - including from one another - and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning.

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>An afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed 'de facto immunity' thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a 'startup kill zone' that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts - including from one another - and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>'We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,' Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was 'not familiar' with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was 'not familiar' with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to 'directly compete' with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. 'Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,' he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without 'reducing the focus on consumer welfare.' She warned against 'drastic' steps such as breakups that carry 'serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.'</p><p>Earlier in the day, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>'Facebook is dangerous,' asserted Sen.

With AP Photos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech faced tough questions this week as federal lawmakers focused on issues of potentially anticompetitive behavior by technology giants and expressed bipartisan skepticism over Facebook's plan for a new digital currency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon have long enjoyed nearly unbridled growth and a mythic stature as once-scrappy startups -- born in garages and a dorm room and a road trip across the United States -- that grew up to dominate their rivals. But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>A Tuesday afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed \"de facto immunity\" thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts -- including from one another -- and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest -- Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp -- and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to \"directly compete\" with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. \"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,\" he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without \"reducing the focus on consumer welfare.\" She warned against \"drastic\" steps such as breakups that carry \"serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p>Marcus returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to face grilling from House lawmakers.</p><p>------</p><p>AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this article from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHATNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHATNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKK-Y5K1-JBP6-R2HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155832</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chattanooga Publishing Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chattanooga Times Free Press (Tennessee)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>A Tuesday afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed \"de facto immunity\" thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behavior with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts - including from one another - and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to \"directly compete\" with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. \"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,\" he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favor of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behavior without \"reducing the focus on consumer welfare.\" She warned against \"drastic\" steps such as breakups that carry \"serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p>Marcus returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to face grilling from House lawmakers.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this article from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APE-dad8880720c8403ab5418dfd8fbf42c5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-K4H1-JC65-54K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"986\"/><timeReceived>3:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But as they've grown more powerful, critics have also grown louder, questioning whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, and if their influence poses a danger to society.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both Democrats and Republicans had grievances to air, even if there wasn't much consensus on what to do about them.</p><p>A Tuesday afternoon panel of the House Judiciary Committee focused on whether it's time for Congress to rein in these companies, which are among the largest on Earth by several measures. Central to that case is whether their business practices run afoul of century-old laws originally designed to combat railroad and oil monopolies.</p><p>For some legislators, mostly Democrats, those laws are in need of updates or at least more stringent enforcement. Ultimately such action could lead to breaking up big online platforms, blocking future acquisitions or imposing other limits on their actions.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, charged that technology giants had enjoyed \"de facto immunity\" thanks to current antitrust doctrine, which typically equates anticompetitive behaviour with higher prices for consumers. That allowed them to expand without restraint and to gobble up potential competitors, he argued, creating a \"startup kill zone\" that prevents smaller companies from challenging incumbents with innovative services and technology.</p><p>A panel of four mid-level executives from the companies countered that their firms continue to innovate, that they face vigorous competition on all fronts - including from one another - and, perhaps most of all, that they were not monopolists in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Facebook, for instance, has argued that it is not a monopoly because it has many competitors in businesses as diverse as private messaging, photo sharing and online advertising.</p><p>So Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse of Colorado asked Facebook's head of global policy development, Matt Perault, to name the world's largest social network by active users. (It is Facebook.) When Perault said he couldn't, Neguse ticked off four of the six largest - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - and had Perault verify that all are owned by Facebook.</p><p>\"We have a word for that and that word is monopoly, or at least monopoly power,\" Neguse said.</p><p>The company representatives didn't help their case by pleading ignorance on multiple occasions. Google's director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, said he was \"not familiar\" with how much Google pays Apple for the right to supply the default search engine for Safari on iPhones. (Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said It was $9 billion in 2018 and $12 billion in 2019.) Cohen also said he was \"not familiar\" with allegations of widespread fraudulent listings on Google Maps.</p><p>Amazon also faced some pointed questioning. Cicilline asked Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at the online retailer, whether it uses the data it collects about popular products to direct consumers to Amazon's own in-house products.</p><p>Sutton said the company doesn't use third-party sellers' data to \"directly compete\" with them. Cicilline, affecting disbelief, twice reminded Sutton that he was under oath. \"Amazon is a trillion-dollar company that runs an online platform with real-time data,\" he said.</p><p>Expert witnesses suggested it might be time to reassess antitrust policy. Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who has advocated for more expansive antitrust enforcement, noted concerns about a fall in the number of startups being formed, and wondered aloud whether the U.S. will remain a place where startups thrive and launch new industries.</p><p>Fiona Scott Morton, a Yale economics professor, argued that stifled competition has hampered innovation and hurt both smaller businesses and consumers, who have no choice but to surrender their privacy and watch more advertising.</p><p>Others, mostly Republicans, rejected what they described as a big-is-bad approach in favour of keeping antitrust enforcers narrowly focused on protecting consumers when there's clear evidence of harm such as price gouging.</p><p>Attorney Maureen Ohlhausen, a former Republican commissioner and acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the government can still protect against anticompetitive behaviour without \"reducing the focus on consumer welfare.\" She warned against \"drastic\" steps such as breakups that carry \"serious risk of doing more harm than good for competition and consumers.\"</p><p>Earlier Tuesday, a Facebook executive appeared before a Senate panel to defend the company's ambitious plan to create a digital currency and pledged to work with regulators to achieve a system that protects the privacy of users' data. David Marcus, who leads the Libra project, faced sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Facebook is dangerous,\" asserted Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee's senior Democrat. Like a toddler playing with matches, \"Facebook has burned down the house over and over,\" he told Marcus. \"Do you really think people should trust you with their bank accounts and their money?\"</p><p>Republican Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona said \"the core issue here is trust.\" Users won't be able to opt out of providing their personal data when joining the new digital wallet for Libra, McSally said.</p><p>Marcus returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to face grilling from House lawmakers.</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Marcy Gordon contributed to this article from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-dad8880720c8403ab5418dfd8fbf42c5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-1KK1-JBVR-344G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"987\"/><timeReceived>11:42 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It comes as the country struggles with a pandemic that's killed 150,000 Americans and thrown millions more into economic chaos. While investors appeared unconcerned, today's hearing is probably the beginning of a long slog for all four companies.  As the U.S. passed 150,000  deaths from the coronavirus pandemic and with millions of Americans facing eviction from their homes and an imminent drop in their unemployment benefits , Congress on Wednesday turned its attention to a very different subject: Whether big tech companies are too powerful.   For more than six hours, members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee grilled the CEOs of Alphabet , Amazon , Apple and Facebook -- four of the country's five most valuable companies, with only Microsoft missing -- on a wide range of matters. The CEOs dialed in through videoconference, while most of the committee members were present in Congress, where Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., repeatedly reminded them to wear masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.   For a full recap, check out CNBC's live blog of the event here.   While the topic was ostensibly antitrust and anti-competitive behavior, several Republican members of the committee attacked Facebook for allegedly suppressing conservative voices, despite the fact that -- as Rep   Jamie Raskin, D.-Md.,   pointed out -- the most popular posts on the site consistently come from right-leaning outfits such as Ben Shapiro, Franklin Graham, and Breitbart.    Other members of the subcommittee seemed unprepared with details. One notable exception was Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who pressed Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg on whether he'd ever threatened to clone a company  he was trying to acquire, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos on how the company uses data from third-party sellers to inform its own product creation. For the most part, the committee members used their time to make speeches and accusations, and frequently interrupted the witnesses before they had a chance to finish answering their questions.   Overall, Zuckerberg and Alphabet's Sundar Pichai received the most questions, while Apple's  received the least. Here's a rundown by company:  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai  Pichai, who testified in front of a textured white wall and dark wooden cabinet decorated with knick-knacks, faced persistent questioning about the company's core search business, including whether it stole content from other web sites -- an accusation leveled by local-business listings site Yelp , among others, in the past -- and why it increasingly is guiding users to its own results rather than third-party web sites.     Rep Ken Buck, R.-Colo., also pressed Pichai on the company's decision to drop out of bidding for a $10 billion Defense Department cloud computing project while pursuing other opportunities in China. Pichai answered by describing how it partners with U.S. agencies and was adamant about not serving customers in China in the present day with the exception of a small number of projects.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  Zuckerberg, appearing in front of a white wood-paneled wall, faced a barrage of questions about the company's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which some members of Congress said were anti-competitive and should be revisited, or forcibly spun out.   In particular, Rep. Jaypal cited documents that showed Instagram founder Kevin Systrom was afraid Facebook would go into \"destroy mode\" and build a clone of Instagram if the start-up didn't agree to an acquisition. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D.-N.Y., accused the company of buying Instagram because it saw it \"as a powerful threat that could siphon business away from Facebook\" and said, \"this is exactly the type of anti-competitive acquisition that antitrust laws were designed to prevent.\" Zuckerberg acknowledged it viewed Instagram as a competitor when it bought the company in 2012, but said that it was far from a given that the picture-sharing app would reach the kind of scale it did with Facebook's help.   Chairman Cicilline, in another line of questioning, accused Facebook of being too slow to remove misinformation about Covid-19, and said that the company's size makes it difficult to police content.   Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  Bezos, who delivered his testimony in front of a bookshelf filled with items including a gold sculpture of three overlapping circles, seemed to be the best-prepared among the four CEOs, and strove to complete his answers even as the congressmembers interrupted him.   Their lines of questioning mostly revolved around how Amazon uses data from customer behavior to compete against third-party sellers who market their products through the Amazon Marketplace.   \"You can set the rules of the game for your competitors but not actually follow those same rules for yourself,\" Rep. Jayapal said. \"Do you think that's fair to the third-party businesses that sell on your platform?\"   Bezos said the company is investigating a Wall Street Journal report that called attention to the practice, and that the company would \"take action\" against employees who violated internal policies around using customer data.   Bezos also appeared surprised at an audio recording from an Amazon Marketplace vendor who said the company removed her from its platform without explanation, and said he did not believe there was a systemic problem with how the company treats its marketplace vendors.   Apple CEO Tim Cook  Cook, who spoke from in front of what appeared to be a blank office partition, faced questioning about Apple's policies toward app developers who sell apps through the App Store. Third-party developers have accused the company of being inconsistent in how it treats them, and Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., dug in on the issue, asking if Apple cut a special deal with Amazon to take lower fees, and whether it offered a Chinese search engine extra help navigating the rules. Cook said that the lower rates are available to any developer meeting the conditions, but demurred on the Baidu question.   Cook also defended Apple's policy of taking a 30% cut of transactions conducted through apps downloaded via the App Store, saying that the commissions were similar or lower than other digital platforms, and that customers who think they're getting a raw deal can always turn to Android phones.    \"If you're a customer, and you don't like the setup, the curated experience of the App Store, you can buy a Samsung,\" he said.  The takeaway: Long slog ahead  Investors seemed completely unconcerned over today's hearings, sending all four companies' stocks up slightly during trading hours.    Indeed, today's hearing was unfocused and rambling, which was somewhat expected given the very different nature of the four companies and the claims against them. Sure, they're all big, but they compete in different markets with different business models. For example, Apple has far from dominant share in the smartphone market, and the main argument is that it exercises too much control over the third-party apps it allows to run on the iPhone, which could lead to higher prices and lower selection. In contrast, Google unquestionably has dominant market share in search, but it's hard to prove consumer harm given that its product is free.    Nonetheless, investors and the companies themselves should be aware that today's hearings likely represent the beginning, rather than the culmination, of a wide range of legal actions against them. Future hearings are likely to be more focused, and government agencies like the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission can subpoena documents and force executives to testify under oath again and again.    As Microsoft learned in the 1990s and 2000s, antitrust regulation can be a drag on innovation and earnings for years. One day of bright lights in front of a congressional subcommittee is a small, sour taste of what could come next.   WATCH:  Rep. Cicilline says these companies have monopoly power</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42716705567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-45X1-JCSC-J0M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The g...</p><p>The chiefs of four of the biggest tech companies in the world -- Amazon , Apple, Facebook and Google -- faced lawmakers Wednesday for a hearing on digital competition that could have cataclysmic impact on an industry largely unhindered by regulators.  The grilling of tech titans Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook , Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai (the companies' respective CEOs), was done by the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee as part of its ongoing, yearlong investigation into competition in the digital market.   The approximately 5-hour hearing's line of questioning was sharply divided down party lines. GOP congress members mostly took the CEOs to task for what most of them perceived as an effort to silence conservative voices online. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. accused Google's CEO of supressing conservative sites because he could not Google a right-leaning article he was searcing for and because he no longer received email after he was elected to Congress.  Rep. Jim Jordan accused Google of \"helping\" Hilary Clinton in 2016 and demanded that each CEO make a commitment \"to not help Joe Biden\" in 2020.   Meanwhile most Democrat members of the commitee pummeled the CEOs with questions about monopolizing their markets, concerns over data privacy and other antitrust issues.   Here is a rundown on the hearing. All times Eastern.  6:16 p.m: Did Amazon use pandemic to sell more of its own products?, congresswoman asks Bezos Rep. Mary Scanlon says, when the pandemic hit, \"Amazon said it was going to delay shipment of nonessential products.\" She accused the e-commerce giant of applying that policy selectively and asked why \"Amazon devices like Fire TV, Echo speakers and Ring doorbells\" were deemed essential during the pandemic.  \"There was no playbook for this; demand went through the roof,\" Bezos responded. \"Our goal was to limit to essential supplies but I am sure we did not do that perfectly,\" he said.  6:05 p.m.: Jim Jordan asks tech CEOs about 'cancel culture' Rep. Jim Jordan said the \"cancel culture mob is dangerous.\" He went on to ask each CEO what their thoughts were on \"cancel culture,.\"  Tim Cook: \"I think it's good for people to hear different people, different points of view.\"   Zuckerberg: \"I believe strongly in free expression. I'm very worried about some forces in this country that I see pushing against free expression.   Bezos: \"I am concerned in general about that.\" Bezosa called social media a \"destruction machine.\"  5:56: Democrat congressman calls out GOP peers on their line of questioning, doesn't understand 'the whining' Taking a brief respite from questioning the tech CEOs, Rep. Raskin, D-Md., took some of his Republican colleagues to task for their questions during the hearing. \"Top performing links/posts on Facebook ... are right-wing sites,\" Raskin said. \"If Facebook is trying to repress conservative speecs they are doing a terrible job. I don't understand the whining.\" Raskin said the recent removal by Twitter of Trump's tweets was about spreading false information about public health and that he didn't understand his colleagues' line of questioning. 5:15 p.m.: Cook questioned over App Store Rep. Lucy Kay McBath, D-Ga. came out swinging at Cook over Apple's App Store, asking him directly if Apple has \"the power to exclude apps from the App Store.\"  \"If you look at the history of this, congresswoman, we've increased the number of apps from 500 to 1.7 million so there is a very wide gate for the App Store,\" Cook responded. \"And there is fierce competition for developers and we want every app we can on the platform.\"   McBath countered by saying, \"Apple can exclude apps from the App Store in fact it has.\"   She cited a 2016 incident when Apple introduced its own ScreenTime app, and simultaneously removed other parental control apps that monitored children's screen time.   Cook said the other apps were removed for privacy concerns, but McBath noted that they came right back to the store approximately six months later after multiple complaints and were asked to make almost no changes to their privacy settings.   \"The timing of the removal seems very coincidental,\" McBath said.  5:00 p.m.: Rep. Scanlon questions Pichai over YouTube Rep. Scanlon pushed Pichai over Google's acquisition of YouTube, which Pichai said was before his time and he could not offer an explanation for why the company paid \"30 times its original bid.\"  \"Google is now by far the top online site where Americans watch videos including children's videos and as I'm sure you're aware federal law prevents companies from collecting data on children under 13,\" Scanlon said. Yet last year, she added, the FTC found Google spent years knowingly collecting data on children under 13 on YouTube.   Pichai said that as a parent, they take these concerns \"very seriously\" and have invested heavily to make sure they are following all regulations.   \"I'm more concerned that you're investing rigorously in luring in advertisers like toymakers Mattel and Hasbro by telling them that Youtube is the No. 1 website regularly visited by kids, that sounds like you are targeting the kids, targeting advertisers to bring them on board,\" she said.   Pichai said he wasn't familiar with the reports she was referencing, but that his office would follow up with hers.  4:00 p.m.: Rep. Nadler presses Facebook and Google over journalism dominance \"The news and journalism industry in this country are in economic free fall,\" Nadler said. \"Tens of thousands of journalists have been laid off in recent years.\"  The reason journalism is in free fall is because Google and Facebook now capture the vast majority of digital ad revenue,\" he added. \"Although news publishers produce valuable content, it is Google and Facebook that increasingly profit off their content.\"   Nadler brought up an incident when Facebook reported high and quickly growing rates of video viewership, and \"based on these metrics, news publishers fired hundreds of journalists choosing to boost their video.\" It was later revealed that Facebook inflated these numbers.   Zuckerberg said he did not know the numbers were inflated, \"and we regret that mistake.\"   \"I certainly know how important it that the metrics we report are accurate,\" he added.   Nadler asked Zuckerberg what he would say to the journalists who have \"lost their jobs because of Facebook's deception.\"   \"I disagree with that characterization,\" the tech CEO said.   Nadler concluded by calling it a \"very dangerous situation.\"  3:50 p.m.: 'We have adapted features,' Zuckerberg replies when asked about copying competitors Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-W.A., accused the social media CEO of \"copying other apps that could prevent our competitors from gaining other footholds,\" citing what she said was a plan disclosed by Facebook executives as per a Wall Street Journal report.  She said that Facebook threatened the Snapchat CEO that it was building a clone of the Snapchat app. Jayapal asked point blank: \"Do you copy your competitors?\"   Zuckerberg answered, \"We have adapted features\" but said that he did not agree with the premise that they copied competitors.  3:30 p.m.: Rep. Cicilline calls Amazon's dealing with third-party sellers 'fundamentally anti-competitive' Rep. Cicilline took aim at Amazon's marketplace and allegations from a Wall Street Journal report that the company rips off products from third-party sellers.  Cicilline also noted that \"Amazon controls as much as 75% of all online marketplace sales,\" asking Bezos, \"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but to rely on Amazon to connect with customers and make online sales?\"   Bezos argued that \"I believe there are a lot of options,\" but \"Amazon is the best one.\"   Cicilline then pressed Bezos as to whether Amazon refers to third-party sellers as \"internal competitors.\"   \"In some ways we are competing, and they're also competing with each other,\" Bezos said.   The congressman said that during their yearlong investigation, \"We have heard so many heartbreaking stories of small businesses who sunk significant time and resources into building a business and selling on amazon only to have amazon poach their best items and drive them out of business.\"   \"Isn't it an inherent conflict of interest for Amazon to produce and sell products on its platform that compete directly with third-party sellers particularly [when] you, Amazon, set the rules of the game?\" he added.  Bezos argued that it is best for the customers, and \"consumers are the ones ultimately making the decision.\" He said they have a policy against using \"individual seller data to compete with our private label products\" and they are looking into whether that is being upheld as a result of the Wall Street Journal article.   Cicilline concluded by saying their evidence shows \"Amazon is only interested in exploiting its monopoly power over the commerce market place to further expand and protect this power.\"   \"This investigation makes clear that Amazon's dual role as a platform operator and competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action,\" he said.  3:15 p.m.: Rep. Jordan demands Google not help Joe Biden in 2020 In a fiery tirade, Rep. Jordan accused Google of trying to \"help Clinton\" in 2016 and asked the company's CEO to not help Joe Biden in 2020.  \"According to your multicultural marketing executive\" the company \"tried to help Clinton,\" Jordan said, and asked for assurance that Google \"would not try and help Joe Biden in 2020.\"   Pinchai told Jordan \"you have my commitment\" that Google will act in a non-partisan manner.   The exchange took a heated turn with Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-P.A., said \"\"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust laws rather than fringe conspiracy theories.\"   Jordan was then admonished by other members of the committee for running over his allotted time and refusing to put back on his mask at one point after his questioning.  3:04 p.m.: Congressman presses Pichai over why he could not find a conservative article via Google In a bizarre exchange gaining traction online, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. asked Pinchai why he was unable to Google to find a conservative article he had wanted to read and instead had to type the website's address.  Steube also mentioned that since he was elected to Congress, his emails have been going into his spam folder. He asked Pinchai if there was some effort to silence conservative voices, a common theme among questioning by Republicans during the hearing.   Pinchai said that Google approaches its work in a \"non-partisan way\" and that \"on our platform there are more conservative voices than ever before. He also told Steube he would have to look into this specific issue to see what had happened when he tried to Google his article and asked that Pichai follow up with his office.  2:15 p.m.: Zuckerberg questioned over Facebook's acquisition of Instagram Zuckerberg faced tough questioning from Nadler over Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012, which Nadler says was part of Facebook's attempt to suppress competition.  \"I've always been clear that we viewed Instagram both as a competitor and as a compliment to our services,\" Zuckerberg said.   Nadler questioned Zuckerberg on reports that he previously viewed Instagram as a \"threat\" to Facebook prior to the acquisition, and that he purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitor.   \"I've been clear that Instagram was a competitor in the space of mobile photo sharing, there were a lot of others at the time,\" he said. \"It was a subset of the overall space of connecting that we exist in and by having them join us they certainly went from being a competitor in the space of being a mobile camera to an app that we could help grow.\"   Nadler pressed Zuckerberg as to why Instagram should not be broken off into a separate company if it was acquired to suppress a threat of competition. Zuckerberg argued that the FTC reviewed the documents and voted not to challenge the acquisition at the time.   \"With hindsight it probably looks obvious that Instagram would reach the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\" Zuckerberg said, saying there was no guarantee Instagram would succeed.   Nadler concludes by doubling down, saying Facebook \"saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook, so rather than compete with it Facebook bought it.\"   \"This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\"  \"This should never have happened in the first place ... and it cannot happen again.\"  2:05 p.m.: Zuckerberg pressed over hydroxychloroquine incident on Twitter Jim Sensenbrenner, R-W.I., used his time to question Zuckerberg over separate controversy, involving Twitter, Donald Trump Jr. and hydroxychloroquine. While Twitter's CEO was not present at the hearing, Zuckerberg defended his competitor's action and said social media companies should not be the \"arbiters of truth.\"  \"It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up -- the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine,\" Sensenbrenner said. \"Now, I wouldn't take it myself, but there still is a debate on whether it is effective either in treating or preventing COVID-19 and I think that this is a legitimate matter of discussion, and it would be up to a patient and their doctor to determine whether hydroxychloroquine was the correct medication, you know, given the circumstances.\"   Zuckerberg noted that, \"I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that, but I can talk to our policies about this.\"   \"We do prohibit content that will lead to imminent risk of harm, and stating that there's a proven cure for COVID, when there is in fact none, might encourage someone to go take something that could have some adverse effects so we do take that down,\" Zuckerberg said.   Sensenbrenner argued that \"wouldn't that be up to somebody else, you know, to say okay what somebody posted on this really isn't true and here's what the facts are. Rather than having Twitter or Facebook take it down?\"   Zuckerberg said he agreed with Sensenbrenner that, \"we do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that that would be a bad position for us to be in and not, not what we should be doing.\"   Finally, Zuckerberg argued, however that if something could cause harm they think it should be taken down.   \"But on specific claims,if someone is going to go out and say that, that hydroxychloroquine has proven to cure COVID when in fact it has not been proven to cure COVID and that that statement could lead people to take a drug, that in some cases, some of the data suggests that might be harmful to people, we think that we should take that down,\" he said. \"That could cause imminent risk of harm.\"  1:55 p.m.: Zuckerberg says 'we compete hard' \"The tech industry is an American success story,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks. \"Our industry is one of the ways that America shares its values with the world and one of its greatest economic and cultural exports.\"  He says Facebook has helped many small businesses stay afloat amid the COVID-19 crisis.   \"Our services are about connection and our business model is advertising, we face intense competition in both,\" he said, adding that for every dollar spent on advertising in the U.S., \"less than 10 cents is spent with us.\"   \"New companies are created all the time all over the world and history shows that if we don't keep innovating someone will replace every company here today. That change can often happen faster than you expect,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We compete hard. We compete fairly. We try to be the best. That's what I was taught matters in this country. And when we succeed, it's because we deliver great experiences that people love.\"   Ultimately, Zuckerberg said he doesn't believe \"private companies should be making so many decisions about these issues by themselves\" and argued for new regulation for the internet.  1:50 p.m.: Tim Cook says Apple faces fierce competition In his prepared remarks, Cook described Apple's origin and said the company's success \"is only possible in this country.\"  He also argued that the \"smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches.\"   Cook said Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where \"we do business,\" including iPhone or \"any product\" category.   He also defended the App Store, saying for a vast majority of apps on the App Store, developers keep 100% of the money they make.   He also said that they have never raised the commission or added a single fee to the App Store since it debuted more than a decade ago.   Cook concluded by saying that he supports competition as a great virtue that promotes innovation.   \"I'm here today because scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate. We approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts,\" Cook said. \"If Apple is the gatekeeper, what we've done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store, not keep them off.\" 1:45: Pichai defends Google Ads, and says other tools have helped small business Pichai defended how Google Ads and other tools have helped small businesses in his opening statement.  \"Online has been a lifeline for so many businesses, especially during the global pandemic,\" Pichai said in his prepared remarks. \"Nearly one-third of small business owners say that without digital tools they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID.\"   Pichai also noted Google's massive investments in research and development. He added that competition drives their innovation.   \"New competitors emerge every day and today users have more access to information than ever before,\" he said. \"Competition drives us to innovate and it also leads to better products, lower choices and more choice for everyone.\"   He concluded that they are committed to working with lawmakers to \"protect consumers, maintain America's competitive technological edge in the world, and ensure that every American has access to the incredible opportunities that technology creates.\"  1:40 p.m.: Bezos delivers opening remarks, says Amazon 'should be scrutinized' Bezos delivered his prepared remarks, which were released ahead of time by Amazon .  Bezos described Amazon's early days and its rise to success. He also defends the company's place in the e-commerce world and its impact on the economy.   He said there are 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores, and more than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in Amazon stores in 2019.   According to his estimates, third-party businesses selling in Amazon's stores have created over 2.2 million new jobs around the world.   Bezos said he \"walked away from a steady job on Wall Street into a Seattle garage\" to found Amazon, fully \"understanding that it might not work.\"   \"It feels like just yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself dreaming that one day we might afford a forklift. Customer obsession has driven our success, and I take it as an article of faith the customers notice when you do the right thing,\" Bezos added. \"You earn trust slowly over time by doing hard things well, delivering on time, offering everyday low prices, making promises and keeping them.\"   Finally, the CEO expressed confidence in his business, saying, \"I believe Amazon should be scrutinized.\"   \"We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or nonprofits,\" Bezos said. \"Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors.\"  1:35 p.m.: Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg and Pichai are sworn-in virtually Via a WebEx video software, the four big tech CEOs virtually swore-in for their testimonies. Then, Bezos kicked off with his remarks. 1:30 p.m.: Jordan says 'Big tech is out to get conservatives' \"I'll just cut to the chase, big tech is out to get conservatives,\"  Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening remarks. \"That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch, that's a fact.\"  Jordan cited a litany of what he considered as examples from over the years, ranging from Google not promoting and Facebook \"suppressing\" conservative views.   \"We love the fact that these are American companies,\" he added. \"What's not great is censoring conservatives and trying to win elections, and if it doesn't end, there has to be consequences.\"  1:20 p.m.: Nadler slams 'concentration of power' \"Today it is effectively impossible to use the internet without using in one way or another the service of these four companies,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in his opening remarks.  \"I have long believed with Thomas Jefferson and Louis Brandeis that concentration of power in any form, especially concentration of economic or political power is dangerous to a democratic society,\" he added.   Nadler said their concentration of power is why these companies, and the existing U.S. antitrust laws, must be further scrutinized.  1:10 p.m.: Cicillin kicks off hearing with opening remarks Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., kicked off the hearing with opening remarks, saying the \"purpose of today's hearing is to examine the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\"  \"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy, in the wake of COVID-19, however they're likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before,\" he added.   \"As American families shift more of their work shopping and communication online, these giants stand to profit. Locally owned business, meanwhile, Mom and Pop stores on Main Street face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history,\" Cicilline said. \"As hard as it is to believe it is possible that our economy will emerge form this crisis even more concentrated and consolidated than before.\"   He argued that the dominance of the four tech giants is thus hurting the U.S. economy as a whole.  12:25 p.m.: Hearing delayed slightly as room is being cleaned The highly anticipated hearing, which was scheduled to start at noon, is off to a delayed start Wednesday as the room is being cleaned.  Wednesday's hearing is taking place in the same room where Attorney General William Barr testified for five hours Tuesday . Tuesday's hearing was attended by Congressman Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has tested positive for the coronavirus, a source told ABC News Wednesday.   Despite the delay, a few masked-up lawmakers have already taken their positions on the dais including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La.  12:07 p.m.: Trump calls for action from Congress on Twitter ahead of the hearing President Donald Trump shared some thoughts via Twitter ahead of the hearing, writing, \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.\"  He continued: \"In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"  5 a.m.: CEOs release their opening remarks, here is what is expected today Lawmakers have said Wednesday's hearing will be a part of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee's ongoing, year-long investigation into competition in the digital market.  \"Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in a joint statement earlier this month announcing the hearing.   \"As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation,\" the statement added.   The subcommittee has been investigating the industry dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the \"adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement\" since last June, Nadler and Cicilline said.   Notably, this will be the first time Amazon's CEO Bezos -- the richest man in the world according to Forbes' realtime data on billionaires -- will be in the hot seat testifying before Congress. Amazon has also been at the fore of the subcommittee's investigation. Lawmakers are expected to ask about, among other things, reports that Amazon used sensitive business information from third-party sellers on its platforms, according to a statement .   Apple's App Store has also been the subject of antitrust scrutiny, and last month officials in the European Union officially launched an investigation on whether the distribution of apps on its store potentially violate EU competition rules.   Facebook's power and reach has been the subject of multiple past congressional hearings , and many of the key points raised in the past will likely come up again especially as the 2020 presidential election nears and the social media giant has pledged it won't make the same mistakes it did in 2016 .   Google's dominance in the online advertising world is also expected to come up, amid mounting media reports that a Department of Justice antitrust suit against Google over its ad businesses could be forthcoming.   The hearing, which will be livestreamed, is scheduled to start at noon and the guests are expected to appear virtually as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The g...</p><p>The chiefs of four of the biggest tech companies in the world -- Amazon , Apple, Facebook and Google -- faced lawmakers Wednesday for a hearing on digital competition that could have cataclysmic impact on an industry largely unhindered by regulators.  The grilling of tech titans Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook , Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai (the companies' respective CEOs), was done by the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee as part of its ongoing, yearlong investigation into competition in the digital market.   The approximately 5-hour hearing's line of questioning was sharply divided down party lines. GOP congress members mostly took the CEOs to task for what most of them perceived as an effort to silence conservative voices online. Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. accused Google's CEO of supressing conservative sites because he could not Google a right-leaning article he was searcing for and because he no longer received email after he was elected to Congress.  Rep. Jim Jordan accused Google of \"helping\" Hilary Clinton in 2016 and demanded that each CEO make a commitment \"to not help Joe Biden\" in 2020.   Meanwhile most Democrat members of the commitee pummeled the CEOs with questions about monopolizing their markets, concerns over data privacy and other antitrust issues.   Here is a rundown on the hearing. All times Eastern.  6:16 p.m: Did Amazon use pandemic to sell more of its own products?, congresswoman asks Bezos Rep. Mary Scanlon says, when the pandemic hit, \"Amazon said it was going to delay shipment of nonessential products.\" She accused the e-commerce giant of applying that policy selectively and asked why \"Amazon devices like Fire TV, Echo speakers and Ring doorbells\" were deemed essential during the pandemic.  \"There was no playbook for this; demand went through the roof,\" Bezos responded. \"Our goal was to limit to essential supplies but I am sure we did not do that perfectly,\" he said.  6:05 p.m.: Jim Jordan asks tech CEOs about 'cancel culture' Rep. Jim Jordan said the \"cancel culture mob is dangerous.\" He went on to ask each CEO what their thoughts were on \"cancel culture,.\"  Tim Cook: \"I think it's good for people to hear different people, different points of view.\"   Zuckerberg: \"I believe strongly in free expression. I'm very worried about some forces in this country that I see pushing against free expression.   Bezos: \"I am concerned in general about that.\" Bezosa called social media a \"destruction machine.\"  5:56: Democrat congressman calls out GOP peers on their line of questioning, doesn't understand 'the whining' Taking a brief respite from questioning the tech CEOs, Rep. Raskin, D-Md., took some of his Republican colleagues to task for their questions during the hearing. \"Top performing links/posts on Facebook ... are right-wing sites,\" Raskin said. \"If Facebook is trying to repress conservative speecs they are doing a terrible job. I don't understand the whining.\" Raskin said the recent removal by Twitter of Trump's tweets was about spreading false information about public health and that he didn't understand his colleagues' line of questioning. 5:15 p.m.: Cook questioned over App Store Rep. Lucy Kay McBath, D-Ga. came out swinging at Cook over Apple's App Store, asking him directly if Apple has \"the power to exclude apps from the App Store.\"  \"If you look at the history of this, congresswoman, we've increased the number of apps from 500 to 1.7 million so there is a very wide gate for the App Store,\" Cook responded. \"And there is fierce competition for developers and we want every app we can on the platform.\"   McBath countered by saying, \"Apple can exclude apps from the App Store in fact it has.\"   She cited a 2016 incident when Apple introduced its own ScreenTime app, and simultaneously removed other parental control apps that monitored children's screen time.   Cook said the other apps were removed for privacy concerns, but McBath noted that they came right back to the store approximately six months later after multiple complaints and were asked to make almost no changes to their privacy settings.   \"The timing of the removal seems very coincidental,\" McBath said.  5:00 p.m.: Rep. Scanlon questions Pichai over YouTube Rep. Scanlon pushed Pichai over Google's acquisition of YouTube, which Pichai said was before his time and he could not offer an explanation for why the company paid \"30 times its original bid.\"  \"Google is now by far the top online site where Americans watch videos including children's videos and as I'm sure you're aware federal law prevents companies from collecting data on children under 13,\" Scanlon said. Yet last year, she added, the FTC found Google spent years knowingly collecting data on children under 13 on YouTube.   Pichai said that as a parent, they take these concerns \"very seriously\" and have invested heavily to make sure they are following all regulations.   \"I'm more concerned that you're investing rigorously in luring in advertisers like toymakers Mattel and Hasbro by telling them that Youtube is the No. 1 website regularly visited by kids, that sounds like you are targeting the kids, targeting advertisers to bring them on board,\" she said.   Pichai said he wasn't familiar with the reports she was referencing, but that his office would follow up with hers.  4:00 p.m.: Rep. Nadler presses Facebook and Google over journalism dominance \"The news and journalism industry in this country are in economic free fall,\" Nadler said. \"Tens of thousands of journalists have been laid off in recent years.\"  The reason journalism is in free fall is because Google and Facebook now capture the vast majority of digital ad revenue,\" he added. \"Although news publishers produce valuable content, it is Google and Facebook that increasingly profit off their content.\"   Nadler brought up an incident when Facebook reported high and quickly growing rates of video viewership, and \"based on these metrics, news publishers fired hundreds of journalists choosing to boost their video.\" It was later revealed that Facebook inflated these numbers.   Zuckerberg said he did not know the numbers were inflated, \"and we regret that mistake.\"   \"I certainly know how important it that the metrics we report are accurate,\" he added.   Nadler asked Zuckerberg what he would say to the journalists who have \"lost their jobs because of Facebook's deception.\"   \"I disagree with that characterization,\" the tech CEO said.   Nadler concluded by calling it a \"very dangerous situation.\"  3:50 p.m.: 'We have adapted features,' Zuckerberg replies when asked about copying competitors Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-W.A., accused the social media CEO of \"copying other apps that could prevent our competitors from gaining other footholds,\" citing what she said was a plan disclosed by Facebook executives as per a Wall Street Journal report.  She said that Facebook threatened the Snapchat CEO that it was building a clone of the Snapchat app. Jayapal asked point blank: \"Do you copy your competitors?\"   Zuckerberg answered, \"We have adapted features\" but said that he did not agree with the premise that they copied competitors.  3:30 p.m.: Rep. Cicilline calls Amazon's dealing with third-party sellers 'fundamentally anti-competitive' Rep. Cicilline took aim at Amazon's marketplace and allegations from a Wall Street Journal report that the company rips off products from third-party sellers.  Cicilline also noted that \"Amazon controls as much as 75% of all online marketplace sales,\" asking Bezos, \"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but to rely on Amazon to connect with customers and make online sales?\"   Bezos argued that \"I believe there are a lot of options,\" but \"Amazon is the best one.\"   Cicilline then pressed Bezos as to whether Amazon refers to third-party sellers as \"internal competitors.\"   \"In some ways we are competing, and they're also competing with each other,\" Bezos said.   The congressman said that during their yearlong investigation, \"We have heard so many heartbreaking stories of small businesses who sunk significant time and resources into building a business and selling on amazon only to have amazon poach their best items and drive them out of business.\"   \"Isn't it an inherent conflict of interest for Amazon to produce and sell products on its platform that compete directly with third-party sellers particularly [when] you, Amazon, set the rules of the game?\" he added.  Bezos argued that it is best for the customers, and \"consumers are the ones ultimately making the decision.\" He said they have a policy against using \"individual seller data to compete with our private label products\" and they are looking into whether that is being upheld as a result of the Wall Street Journal article.   Cicilline concluded by saying their evidence shows \"Amazon is only interested in exploiting its monopoly power over the commerce market place to further expand and protect this power.\"   \"This investigation makes clear that Amazon's dual role as a platform operator and competing seller on that platform is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action,\" he said.  3:15 p.m.: Rep. Jordan demands Google not help Joe Biden in 2020 In a fiery tirade, Rep. Jordan accused Google of trying to \"help Clinton\" in 2016 and asked the company's CEO to not help Joe Biden in 2020.  \"According to your multicultural marketing executive\" the company \"tried to help Clinton,\" Jordan said, and asked for assurance that Google \"would not try and help Joe Biden in 2020.\"   Pinchai told Jordan \"you have my commitment\" that Google will act in a non-partisan manner.   The exchange took a heated turn with Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-P.A., said \"\"I'd like to redirect your attention to antitrust laws rather than fringe conspiracy theories.\"   Jordan was then admonished by other members of the committee for running over his allotted time and refusing to put back on his mask at one point after his questioning.  3:04 p.m.: Congressman presses Pichai over why he could not find a conservative article via Google In a bizarre exchange gaining traction online, Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla. asked Pinchai why he was unable to Google to find a conservative article he had wanted to read and instead had to type the website's address.  Steube also mentioned that since he was elected to Congress, his emails have been going into his spam folder. He asked Pinchai if there was some effort to silence conservative voices, a common theme among questioning by Republicans during the hearing.   Pinchai said that Google approaches its work in a \"non-partisan way\" and that \"on our platform there are more conservative voices than ever before. He also told Steube he would have to look into this specific issue to see what had happened when he tried to Google his article and asked that Pichai follow up with his office.  2:15 p.m.: Zuckerberg questioned over Facebook's acquisition of Instagram Zuckerberg faced tough questioning from Nadler over Facebook's acquisition of Instagram in 2012, which Nadler says was part of Facebook's attempt to suppress competition.  \"I've always been clear that we viewed Instagram both as a competitor and as a compliment to our services,\" Zuckerberg said.   Nadler questioned Zuckerberg on reports that he previously viewed Instagram as a \"threat\" to Facebook prior to the acquisition, and that he purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitor.   \"I've been clear that Instagram was a competitor in the space of mobile photo sharing, there were a lot of others at the time,\" he said. \"It was a subset of the overall space of connecting that we exist in and by having them join us they certainly went from being a competitor in the space of being a mobile camera to an app that we could help grow.\"   Nadler pressed Zuckerberg as to why Instagram should not be broken off into a separate company if it was acquired to suppress a threat of competition. Zuckerberg argued that the FTC reviewed the documents and voted not to challenge the acquisition at the time.   \"With hindsight it probably looks obvious that Instagram would reach the scale it has today, but at the time it was far from obvious,\" Zuckerberg said, saying there was no guarantee Instagram would succeed.   Nadler concludes by doubling down, saying Facebook \"saw Instagram as a threat that could potentially siphon business away from Facebook, so rather than compete with it Facebook bought it.\"   \"This is exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\"  \"This should never have happened in the first place ... and it cannot happen again.\"  2:05 p.m.: Zuckerberg pressed over hydroxychloroquine incident on Twitter Jim Sensenbrenner, R-W.I., used his time to question Zuckerberg over separate controversy, involving Twitter, Donald Trump Jr. and hydroxychloroquine. While Twitter's CEO was not present at the hearing, Zuckerberg defended his competitor's action and said social media companies should not be the \"arbiters of truth.\"  \"It was reported that Donald Trump Jr. got taken down for a period of time because he put something up -- the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine,\" Sensenbrenner said. \"Now, I wouldn't take it myself, but there still is a debate on whether it is effective either in treating or preventing COVID-19 and I think that this is a legitimate matter of discussion, and it would be up to a patient and their doctor to determine whether hydroxychloroquine was the correct medication, you know, given the circumstances.\"   Zuckerberg noted that, \"I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that, but I can talk to our policies about this.\"   \"We do prohibit content that will lead to imminent risk of harm, and stating that there's a proven cure for COVID, when there is in fact none, might encourage someone to go take something that could have some adverse effects so we do take that down,\" Zuckerberg said.   Sensenbrenner argued that \"wouldn't that be up to somebody else, you know, to say okay what somebody posted on this really isn't true and here's what the facts are. Rather than having Twitter or Facebook take it down?\"   Zuckerberg said he agreed with Sensenbrenner that, \"we do not want to become the arbiters of truth. I think that that would be a bad position for us to be in and not, not what we should be doing.\"   Finally, Zuckerberg argued, however that if something could cause harm they think it should be taken down.   \"But on specific claims,if someone is going to go out and say that, that hydroxychloroquine has proven to cure COVID when in fact it has not been proven to cure COVID and that that statement could lead people to take a drug, that in some cases, some of the data suggests that might be harmful to people, we think that we should take that down,\" he said. \"That could cause imminent risk of harm.\"  1:55 p.m.: Zuckerberg says 'we compete hard' \"The tech industry is an American success story,\" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks. \"Our industry is one of the ways that America shares its values with the world and one of its greatest economic and cultural exports.\"  He says Facebook has helped many small businesses stay afloat amid the COVID-19 crisis.   \"Our services are about connection and our business model is advertising, we face intense competition in both,\" he said, adding that for every dollar spent on advertising in the U.S., \"less than 10 cents is spent with us.\"   \"New companies are created all the time all over the world and history shows that if we don't keep innovating someone will replace every company here today. That change can often happen faster than you expect,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We compete hard. We compete fairly. We try to be the best. That's what I was taught matters in this country. And when we succeed, it's because we deliver great experiences that people love.\"   Ultimately, Zuckerberg said he doesn't believe \"private companies should be making so many decisions about these issues by themselves\" and argued for new regulation for the internet.  1:50 p.m.: Tim Cook says Apple faces fierce competition In his prepared remarks, Cook described Apple's origin and said the company's success \"is only possible in this country.\"  He also argued that the \"smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches.\"   Cook said Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where \"we do business,\" including iPhone or \"any product\" category.   He also defended the App Store, saying for a vast majority of apps on the App Store, developers keep 100% of the money they make.   He also said that they have never raised the commission or added a single fee to the App Store since it debuted more than a decade ago.   Cook concluded by saying that he supports competition as a great virtue that promotes innovation.   \"I'm here today because scrutiny is reasonable and appropriate. We approach this process with respect and humility, but we make no concession on the facts,\" Cook said. \"If Apple is the gatekeeper, what we've done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store, not keep them off.\" 1:45: Pichai defends Google Ads, and says other tools have helped small business Pichai defended how Google Ads and other tools have helped small businesses in his opening statement.  \"Online has been a lifeline for so many businesses, especially during the global pandemic,\" Pichai said in his prepared remarks. \"Nearly one-third of small business owners say that without digital tools they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID.\"   Pichai also noted Google's massive investments in research and development. He added that competition drives their innovation.   \"New competitors emerge every day and today users have more access to information than ever before,\" he said. \"Competition drives us to innovate and it also leads to better products, lower choices and more choice for everyone.\"   He concluded that they are committed to working with lawmakers to \"protect consumers, maintain America's competitive technological edge in the world, and ensure that every American has access to the incredible opportunities that technology creates.\"  1:40 p.m.: Bezos delivers opening remarks, says Amazon 'should be scrutinized' Bezos delivered his prepared remarks, which were released ahead of time by Amazon .  Bezos described Amazon's early days and its rise to success. He also defends the company's place in the e-commerce world and its impact on the economy.   He said there are 1.7 million small and medium-sized businesses around the world selling in Amazon's stores, and more than 200,000 entrepreneurs worldwide surpassed $100,000 in sales in Amazon stores in 2019.   According to his estimates, third-party businesses selling in Amazon's stores have created over 2.2 million new jobs around the world.   Bezos said he \"walked away from a steady job on Wall Street into a Seattle garage\" to found Amazon, fully \"understanding that it might not work.\"   \"It feels like just yesterday I was driving the packages to the post office myself dreaming that one day we might afford a forklift. Customer obsession has driven our success, and I take it as an article of faith the customers notice when you do the right thing,\" Bezos added. \"You earn trust slowly over time by doing hard things well, delivering on time, offering everyday low prices, making promises and keeping them.\"   Finally, the CEO expressed confidence in his business, saying, \"I believe Amazon should be scrutinized.\"   \"We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or nonprofits,\" Bezos said. \"Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colors.\"  1:35 p.m.: Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg and Pichai are sworn-in virtually Via a WebEx video software, the four big tech CEOs virtually swore-in for their testimonies. Then, Bezos kicked off with his remarks. 1:30 p.m.: Jordan says 'Big tech is out to get conservatives' \"I'll just cut to the chase, big tech is out to get conservatives,\"  Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said in his opening remarks. \"That's not a suspicion, that's not a hunch, that's a fact.\"  Jordan cited a litany of what he considered as examples from over the years, ranging from Google not promoting and Facebook \"suppressing\" conservative views.   \"We love the fact that these are American companies,\" he added. \"What's not great is censoring conservatives and trying to win elections, and if it doesn't end, there has to be consequences.\"  1:20 p.m.: Nadler slams 'concentration of power' \"Today it is effectively impossible to use the internet without using in one way or another the service of these four companies,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in his opening remarks.  \"I have long believed with Thomas Jefferson and Louis Brandeis that concentration of power in any form, especially concentration of economic or political power is dangerous to a democratic society,\" he added.   Nadler said their concentration of power is why these companies, and the existing U.S. antitrust laws, must be further scrutinized.  1:10 p.m.: Cicillin kicks off hearing with opening remarks Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., kicked off the hearing with opening remarks, saying the \"purpose of today's hearing is to examine the dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.\"  \"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy, in the wake of COVID-19, however they're likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before,\" he added.   \"As American families shift more of their work shopping and communication online, these giants stand to profit. Locally owned business, meanwhile, Mom and Pop stores on Main Street face an economic crisis unlike any in recent history,\" Cicilline said. \"As hard as it is to believe it is possible that our economy will emerge form this crisis even more concentrated and consolidated than before.\"   He argued that the dominance of the four tech giants is thus hurting the U.S. economy as a whole.  12:25 p.m.: Hearing delayed slightly as room is being cleaned The highly anticipated hearing, which was scheduled to start at noon, is off to a delayed start Wednesday as the room is being cleaned.  Wednesday's hearing is taking place in the same room where Attorney General William Barr testified for five hours Tuesday . Tuesday's hearing was attended by Congressman Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican who has tested positive for the coronavirus, a source told ABC News Wednesday.   Despite the delay, a few masked-up lawmakers have already taken their positions on the dais including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La.  12:07 p.m.: Trump calls for action from Congress on Twitter ahead of the hearing President Donald Trump shared some thoughts via Twitter ahead of the hearing, writing, \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.\"  He continued: \"In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!\"  5 a.m.: CEOs release their opening remarks, here is what is expected today Lawmakers have said Wednesday's hearing will be a part of the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee's ongoing, year-long investigation into competition in the digital market.  \"Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in a joint statement earlier this month announcing the hearing.   \"As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation,\" the statement added.   The subcommittee has been investigating the industry dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the \"adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement\" since last June, Nadler and Cicilline said.   Notably, this will be the first time Amazon's CEO Bezos -- the richest man in the world according to Forbes' realtime data on billionaires -- will be in the hot seat testifying before Congress. Amazon has also been at the fore of the subcommittee's investigation. Lawmakers are expected to ask about, among other things, reports that Amazon used sensitive business information from third-party sellers on its platforms, according to a statement .   Apple's App Store has also been the subject of antitrust scrutiny, and last month officials in the European Union officially launched an investigation on whether the distribution of apps on its store potentially violate EU competition rules.   Facebook's power and reach has been the subject of multiple past congressional hearings , and many of the key points raised in the past will likely come up again especially as the 2020 presidential election nears and the social media giant has pledged it won't make the same mistakes it did in 2016 .   Google's dominance in the online advertising world is also expected to come up, amid mounting media reports that a Department of Justice antitrust suit against Google over its ad businesses could be forthcoming.   The hearing, which will be livestreamed, is scheduled to start at noon and the guests are expected to appear virtually as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Google \"is running the marketplace it's acting on the buy side and it's acting on the sell side, which is a major conflict of interest,\" Ms Jayapal said.</p><p>Mr Cook faced tough questioning over the market power of Apple's App Store and its treatment of developers.</p><p>\"We treat all app developers the same,\" Mr Cook said. \"We do not retaliate or bully people.\" </p><p/><p>Mr Bezos, in his first appearance before a congressional committee, defended Amazon's dealings with third-party sellers after a blistering attack from Mr Cicilline. \"Isn't it true that small businesses have no real option but to rely on Amazon to connect with customers to make online sales?\" the committee chair asked.</p><p>\"We've heard from third-party sellers again and again during the course of our investigation that Amazon is the only game in town.\" </p><p>Mr Bezos disputed the characterisation while adding: \"There are a lot of options for small firms. I think we are the best one.\"</p><p>President Donald Trump, who has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring his remarks and being biased against conservatives, weighed in with a tweet shortly before the hearing began, and some Republican representatives echoed those remarks. \"If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Mr Trump said.</p><p>Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, said during the hearing: \"I'll just cut to the chase - Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\" Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland rejected the argument, saying Facebook and other platforms had\u00a0failed to contain misinformation from Mr Trump and his supporters, including unverified COVID-19 claims.</p><p>\"If Facebook is out there trying to repress conservative speech they're doing a terrible job,\" Mr Raskin said. </p><p>\"I don't understand this endless whining\" from Republicans.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg defended Facebook's efforts to regulate false information on its platform, denying that the company has a dominant market position or profits from misleading viral content. He said new competitors companies were emerging all the time. \"History shows that if we don't keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today,\" he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">AFP</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-9985c970c50d9d62b290542721a03c05</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-MYW1-JBR4-F2JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><timeReceived>4:11 AM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The focus is antitrust, and the extent to which a quartet of digital behemoths - representing a nearly $5 trillion slice of the U.S. economy - has harmed competition, consumers and the country writ large.</p><p>The congressional inquiry has been more than a year in the making. Lawmakers have amassed 1.3 million documents, conducted hundreds of hours of interviews and held five other hearings featuring the industry's friends and foes. Led by Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the lawmakers plan to produce a report in coming months that some party leaders expect will find the industry has skirted federal competition laws because the protections haven't kept pace with the digital age.</p><p>In recent decades, similar high-profile interrogations have yielded some of the country's most important reforms, including safeguards to spare the economy from another financial collapse and rules to protect drivers, smokers, workers and countless others from a combination of corporate missteps and lax regulation.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether an increasingly divided Congress can bring the same potency to bear against tech, remedying a long litany of past mistakes - both in Silicon Valley's practices and Washington's oversight of them.</p><p>\"It's very clear to me there are very serious problems that must be addressed, and it's very clear to me these large technology platforms are not going to regulate themselves,\" Cicilline said in an interview. \"The responsibility falls to Congress to do that.\" </p><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google declined requests for comment. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The hearing Wednesday will feature Bezos, as well as chief executives Tim Cook of Apple, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, which owns Google. All but Bezos have testified before Congress in the past, but they will do so this time under unique circumstances. The coronavirus will keep those leaders on the West Coast, answering questions over videoconferencing software in what is perhaps a fitting coda to an investigation that has explored the myriad ways technology has transformed the world - for good and bad.</p><p>The four tech giants often assert they are responsible for decades of U.S. economic gains and a bevy of digital apps and other tools that help people communicate, shop and travel more easily than ever before. But that meteoric growth has come at times with immense costs: The data they collect puts users' privacy at risk, the services they offer can harm the very workers they employ, and the content they permit online carries the potential to destabilize democracy.</p><p>Those ills prompted Cicilline and his Democratic and Republican colleagues to embark on a wide-ranging investigation in June 2019, seeking to probe whether the tech industry's missteps are a consequence of its unrivaled size. Taking aim at Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, Cicilline at the time articulated a belief the \"Internet is broken\" and it poses a real danger to the people who use it and the new businesses that seek to take root there.</p><p>Some of the evidence lawmakers have amassed is set to be furnished publicly for the first time Wednesday. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), one of the panel members who will question the companies, said a few of the documents evince a \"copy-acquire-kill\" strategy on the part of big tech companies to buy or suppress potential rivals. The Democratic lawmaker said the committee has seen some \"very specific language from top-level executives about that,\" but she declined to offer specifics.</p><p>\"We need to move very quickly, as a Congress, to reassert our authority into regulation of these tech companies and [their] anticompetitive practices,\" she said.</p><p>Some Republicans, meanwhile, plan to revive their concerns that major social media sites exhibit political bias. Party leaders have ratcheted up their attacks in recent weeks after Facebook and Twitter began taking action against President Trump for his incendiary posts. But GOP critics often have provided scant evidence of their bias allegations, which tech giants fiercely deny and Democrats have decried as a distraction.</p><p>\"If a platform is dominant in the marketplace and is discriminating against a particular political point of view, [then] anti-competitive behavior coupled with bias is concerning,\" said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a member of the antitrust panel.</p><p>The congressional scrutiny comes as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are already facing a bevy of law-enforcement probes around the world, including in the United States, which could result in major changes to their practices or their potential breakup. The Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit against Google as soon as this summer, The Washington Post previously reported.</p><p>\"This is the big moment for the [companies] to really show that what they're doing is pro-innovation and pro-consumer,\" said Robert Atkinson, the president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, which counts some of those companies' officials on its board of directors.</p><p>\"If they don't do that well, and if the members push back enough, you could see it as a turning point where from now on it's going to be much harder slogging for the industry going forward,\" Atkinson said.</p><p>With Amazon, the concern is the company's domination of e-commerce - and the extent to which the tech giant, as both a marketplace for goods and a seller in its own right, gives its products an unfair advantage over those from its competitors. Amazon has maintained it does not harness data from third-party sellers to give its kitchen wares, clothes and other goods a boost. But recent, public reports have raised doubts about its past claims and primed Democrats and Republicans for a sharp interrogation of Bezos.</p><p>Facebook long has faced criticism for gobbling up its rivals, including the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messenger service WhatsApp. The social networking behemoth says it competes for users' time against a wide array of services, including newer entrants such as TikTok. But congressional critics have taken interest in the fact that Facebook's insatiable appetite for data makes it impossible for other social networks to gain much of a foothold, giving Internet users few viable alternatives from which to choose.</p><p>Google has been faulted for its dominant search and advertising platform and the extent to which that harms an array of competitors, including news publishers. In Europe, it has been fined approximately $9 billion in cases that fault its strong-arming tactics - adding to pressure on U.S. regulators to revive a probe they closed years ago without severely punishing Google. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company has said its search and ad services empower the Web and make it easier on users to find what they want.</p><p>Apple recently has emerged as an antitrust conundrum in the eyes of developers. Companies such as Tile, which makes a tool to track lost keys, wallets and other belongings, previously told lawmakers the iPhone giant's heavy-handed approach to the App Store makes it difficult for rival services to grow and maintain their popularity. Apple, however, contends the App Store has made the smartphone software ecosystem possible and has chafed at those who have called for it to be investigated in the same way as its peers.</p><p>For other segments of the economy, similar showdowns with Congress in recent decades have proved equally pivotal. In the 1990s, for example, cigarette executives who claimed under oath that their products weren't addictive soon found themselves facing probes, regulations and other penalties. More than 10 years later, Democrats and Republicans summoned some of baseball's biggest stars to press them about doping in what later compelled the league to rethink its approach to testing. Veterans of these and other probes in banking, energy and telecommunications say they illustrate the formidable power Congress can wield when it conducts meaningful oversight.</p><p>\"You shouldn't have oversight investigations hearings just to blow things up and embarrass people,\" said former congressman James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who oversaw some of the hearings into Enron leading up to the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act that reformed public financing. Members of Congress, he said, had to ask themselves: \"Is this something that can help us become informed to change the law?\" </p><p>Entering the Wednesday hearing, some House Democrats and Republicans say they indeed have grand aspirations in mind with tech, rethinking federal laws so the U.S. government can more easily probe, penalize and potentially unwind large corporations, including those in Silicon Valley. Buck, a GOP lawmaker, insisted even regulation-wary members of his party might be open to adopting new laws targeting the tech industry.</p><p>\"In order for the hearing to be a productive hearing and a success, in my view, it ultimately must lead to statutory recommendations made [on] a bipartisan basis, being pursued by a full Congress,\" added Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), the vice chairman of the House's antitrust panel.</p><p>\"It has to happen,\" he added. \"I think it's long overdue.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-af6d50ac8e334f69a6d66329385b9b51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FN-02V1-DXKP-J239-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1650\"/><timeReceived>10:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the House Antitrust Committee released a trove of documents after the hearing that provide a clearer picture into the four tech giants' approach to competition as they grew into major forces of the global economy over the last decade. The documents show that even with all of Wednesday's political theater, the government still has the goods on Big Tech.  Five and half hours of testimony with four of the most powerful CEOs in the world. Lots of shouting. The richest man on the planet forgot to unmute before speaking on a video call.    What'd we learn during the Big Tech CEO hearing on Wednesday ?   Next to nothing.   But luckily for us, even if much of the House Antitrust Subcommittee seemed distracted by online conspiracy theories and incoherent lines of questioning, it still did a lot of the good and dirty work over the last year, gathering over 1 million documents from Apple , Amazon , Facebook and Google in its antitrust probe against the companies. These documents build a far better antitrust case against the four tech giants than anything the CEOs said during the hearing.   The trove of documents, released Wednesday night after the hearing ended, provide juicy details like how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to buy Instagram at least in part to squash a rising competitive threat, and how Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos negotiated a sweetheart deal with Apple to get Amazon's Prime Video app on the Apple TV.   The Amazon-Apple deal was particularly interesting. The two companies had been at a stalemate since 2016 or so, after Apple opened up the Apple TV to all third-party video apps. But Amazon was notably missing from Apple TV, and the documents released Wednesday reveal that was because Amazon didn't want to pay Apple the standard 30% cut of its sales through Apple's platform.   So Bezos met with Apple's VP in charge of Apple TV, Eddy Cue, and negotiated a 15% cut instead. Shortly after that agreement was made, Amazon also began selling Apple products.   That contradicts Tim Cook's testimony yesterday, when he said Apple treats all apps equally. According to the emails, Amazon got special treatment from Apple that other apps didn't. (Today, Apple takes a 30% cut of subscription fees through its platform for the first year, and 15% after that.)   It didn't stop there with Amazon.   About a decade ago, Amazon was in steep competition with a rising e-commerce company called Quidsi, which operated Diapers.com and Soap.com. The documents show that Amazon intentionally lowered prices of diapers on its site in order to weaken Quidsi.   \"We have already initiated a more aggressive 'plan to win' against diapers.com,\" one Amazon executive wrote in an email released by the subcommittee. \"...To the extent that this plan undercuts the core diapers business for diapers.com, it will slow the adoption of Soap.com\"   And another Amazon email said: \"[T]hese guys are our #1 short term competitor... [W]e need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost.\"   After that, Amazon ended up buying Quidsi for about $500 million. Amazon shut down Quidsi almost seven years later. Quidsi didn't have much of a chance to make it on its own due to the pricing pressure caused by its larger competitor Amazon.   As for Facebook, the documents show that its $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 was at least in part due to Zuckerberg's desire to quash a buzzy and growing competitor. (Zuckerberg argued in his testimony Wednesday that there was no guarantee Instagram would be a success back then, and that its position today as a dominant social media app is because it had Facebook's endless resources to work with.)   But in emails with then-CFO David Ebersman, Zuckerberg discussed the advantages of buying Instagram. Zuckerberg agreed with Ebersman that acquiring Instagram would help \"neutralize a potential competitor.\"    \"Instagram can hurt us meaningfully without becoming a huge business,\" Zuckerberg wrote in another email released Wednesday.   That plays right into one of the remedies that have been proposed against Facebook: split the company up by separating Facebook from other major apps it has acquired, Instagram and WhatsApp.   That's just a taste. There are plenty more documents that were released Wednesday to dig through. They'll make a great beach read for any antitrust dorks out there.    Even if you're not confident that the House Antitrust Subcommittee's upcoming report on the four giants will lead to any passable legislation by a fractured and bitter Congress, we now have fresh insight into Big Tech's dealings behind the scenes as the four giants grew into dominant forces in the global economy over the last decade.   And it doesn't end with Congress. The DOJ, FTC and groups of state attorneys generals are all investigating these four companies to varying degrees. Those investigations are more likely to result in immediate action without waiting for Congress, which has yet to pass a single piece of significant piece of tech regulation since the \"techlash\" began a few years ago.   As expected, Wednesday's hearing made for some spectacular political theater with no substance. But the government has the goods on Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, and these documents should go a long way if and when any action is taken against those Big Tech companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42721872726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV11-F07F-850D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"959\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He authored a 7-2 decision in which he appears to stand up against Donald Trump's lawlessness, by clarifying that Congress can issue subpoenas for Trump financial documents. However, the congressional power is constrained by a new, vague, four-part test for courts to use in approving subpoenas for presidential documents. Roberts grandly reaffirmed congressional power to investigate the executive branch in theory, while making it harder in practice. He presented himself as the sober, rule-of-law judge, calling balls and strikes in the childish conflict between Congress and the executive branch - while giving himself more power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet there's one big silver lining in Mazars: while shifting power from Congress to the courts in executive  branch investigations, it gave Congress a huge green light for investigations into big corporations. According to the logic of the opinion, Congress is at the peak of its power when investigating economic behavior in service of prospective legislation. </p><p>Democratic Congress members should seize the moment.  Trump is a major problem, but so too are corporate monopolies, and we need Congress working at full capacity to keep our democracy from both being devoured and drowning. In other words: we need Nancy Pelosi and the House judiciary committee to take the hammer that the supreme court just gave them and use it to investigate corporate malfeasance, and then pass major new legislation to rein in corporate and monopolistic abuses.</p><p>Will the big tech leaders dictate the terms of engagement, or will Congress?</p><p>The opinion came down just in time for one of the biggest congressional corporate showdowns in a decade. On 27 July, the congressional antitrust subcommittee is holding a major hearing with Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai, and Tim Cook, the capstone of a year-long investigation into big tech companies. It is the first major antitrust investigation in 50 years. The goal of the investigation - and the hearing - is to understand how these famously opaque companies work, and to propose major new legislation in order to curtail abuses that are not currently illegal, but bad for our democracy and economy.</p><p>One big mystery surrounds the hearing: will the big tech leaders dictate the terms of engagement, or will Congress? In the past, when big tech has been allowed to design its own investigations, the results have been embarrassing: remember when Zuckerberg appeared before the Senate, orchestrated a day of five-minute questions, refusing followups, and senators started begging him to support their pet legislation?</p><p>It is critical that this hearing be conducted in a way that allows the subcommittee to grill each CEO individually, with time to dig into matters and serve followup questions. Big tech, on the other hand, wants the hearing to be anticlimactic, to turn this meaningful and important moment into an embarrassing one for Congress. Which will it be?</p><p>This is where Congress's subpoena power comes in. Because of the legal clarity provided by the Mazars decision, Congress holds the upper hand in any negotiation. It can demand whatever format it needs to pursue a real, fact-based, serious investigation. If Bezos says no, he'll see a subpoena on his desk, and courts ready to enforce it.</p><p>Because the format hasn't been announced, it is possible that the big tech companies are playing chicken, threatening to pull out if they don't get the cushiest possible format - limited questions, all the CEOs on one panel. But Mazars makes it clear that their threats are bluffs: the supreme court said Congress's power to hold them accountable is \"broad\" and \"indispensable\".</p><p>The limits on this power that Roberts imposes due to Congress investigating the executive don't apply in the corporate setting at all. In this big tech investigation, Congress is operating right at the heart of its investigative role.</p><p>Last summer, the committee sent the big tech companies a series of queries about how their businesses operate. The companies answered some questions but were hiding the ball on others. Answers to these, and other questions, play a critical role in informing prospective legislation. The antitrust subcommittee is actively considering what new antitrust laws should be passed; it is their job and responsibility to ask.</p><p>Do we cede more power to the monopolists, or does Congress make clear who is in charge?</p><p>The chair of the antitrust subcommittee, David Cicilline, has been fierce and unbowed in his investigations. When Bezos said he wouldn't testify, Cicilline tweeted: \"We have asked Mr Bezos to testify before the US Congress about Amazon's troubling business practices and false statement, and we expect him to do so. Whether he does so voluntarily or by subpoena is his choice.\" But the subpoena decision is not up to Cicilline: due to House rules, the decision to issue a subpoena falls to Pelosi and the House judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler.</p><p>We know what a good hearing looks like: each CEO alone, in person, with sufficient time for Congress people to develop real lines of questioning, and plenty of opportunities for followup. The inverse is true: a bad hearing is all the CEOs together, with five minutes per Congress member. </p><p>Do we cede more power to the monopolists, or does Congress make clear who is in charge? What we don't want is theater: a hearing where four of the most powerful men in world history show up in theory, but use format to avoid hard fact questions and follow up, get the veneer of being good citizens ... and, with a big wink and nod to the rest of us, tell everyone who is really in charge.</p><p>The precedent matters here, too. If Congress folds when one CEO demands theater instead of investigation, what do you think the next CEO will do? Weakness begets weakness.</p><p>One of the big reasons for the hearing in the first place is that big tech has way too much power and has become a private, for-profit regulator of our communications system, our markets, and our democracy.

Spence said his competitors subsidize their smart speakers with data collection from users.</p><p>Tile's Kirsten Daru told the subcommittee Apple created unfair competition to their item-finding product by making it more difficult to enable Tile products on iPhones.

The subcommittee members said they appreciated the opportunity to hear from companies with smaller lobbying budgets.</p><p>\"Through the subcommittee's investigation, it has become clear that the dominant online platforms have tremendous power to shape and influence online commerce,\" said Rep.

The heads of Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google were there to answer questions about their enormous power and how they use it. Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline, who's leading the House investigation into these companies, laid out the stakes.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Our founders would not bow before a king, nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 NPR's Shannon Bond has been watching the hearing and joins us now. And we should note all these companies are financial supporters of NPR.             </p><p>                Hey, Shannon.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Hey, Ailsa.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 So how did these four CEOs come off today, you think?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Well, you know, these are four very powerful men who lead these huge companies that shape everything about the way we live, the way we work, especially these days. And - but, you know, across the board, the message they were sending was, we're not big and scary. We're people just like you.             </p><p>                So Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO - he talked about how his mother had him when he - she was just 17. He talked about his father, a Cuban immigrant, adopting him at age 4. Sundar Pichai of Google also got very biographical. He talked about growing up in India without a computer, the story of immigrating to America, walking into a college computer lab the first time. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg talked about building a company from nothing. And Tim Cook talked about how Apple's success could really only be possible in America. And across the board, they also all underscored how everything they do is about making customers happy. And they face fierce competition from each other, which, of course, was the topic of this hearing.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 Right. OK. So give us a sense of what kinds of questions lawmakers asked. I mean, what seemed to be their main concerns?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Well, many of them, especially on the Democratic side, really honed in on these core competition issues. They're - so they're scrutinizing how these companies got so big and what they're doing with that power. Have they used it to hurt their competitors or even their customers? So an example of this - you know, critics say that Facebook squashes competition by buying or copying rivals. And we heard that come up when Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, asked Zuckerberg about Facebook buying Instagram, the photo-sharing app it bought back in 2012. And Nadler pointed to emails from Zuckerberg to another Facebook executive talking about that purchase.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JERROLD NADLER:                 In your own words, you purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitive threat.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 And in response, Zuckerberg said, at the time, federal regulators approved that deal and, you know, nobody knew back in 2012 that Instagram would get so big.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 I mean, I think with hindsight, it probably looks, like, obvious that Instagram would've reached the scale that it has today. But at the time, it was far from obvious.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 And Democrats had similar questions for Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook about their business models and how they treat competition.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 OK. Those were the Democrats. What about Republicans? What were their concerns?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Well, they used a lot of their time during questioning to bring up a favorite topic - accusations that these big platforms are biased against conservatives. So a prime example is what Jim Jordan, who is the Judiciary Committee's ranking member, asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>JIM JORDAN:                 Can you today assure Americans you will not tailor your features in any way to help - specifically help one candidate over other? And this - what I'm concerned about is you helping Joe Biden over President Trump.             </p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI:                 We won't do any work, you know, to politically tilt anything one way or the other. It's against our core values.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Now, in another exchange with a different member, Pichai says, you know, he gets complaints about bias from all sides, not just conservatives. But, you know, it's this kind of line of questioning that some of the Democratic committee members and staff were sort of concerned about. They said they really wanted this hearing to focus on competition. It's these kind of questions that veered furthest away from those main topics.             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 OK. So what substantively are we expecting to come out of this whole hearing?             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Right. Well, you know, just to remind everyone, this committee has been investigating big tech for a year. They've looked at millions of documents. They've had hours and hours of hearings and closed-door briefings. You know, this was their opportunity to take these questions to the top brass of the company. And ultimately, they're going to produce a report that's expected to recommend potential changes in how antitrust law is enforced and maybe even changes to the law - those laws themselves 'cause, of course, Congress gets to write the law. And Cicilline, who's leading the investigation, has talked about how it has been a bipartisan process.             </p><p>                But it's not so clear, really, that there is real support for new laws on a bipartisan basis, especially from Republicans like Jim Sensenbrenner, the ranking member on the Antitrust Subcommittee. And he said, I think the laws we have are fine; maybe it's about enforcing them. And also, remember, taking on these companies - that's taking on an economic powerhouse at a time when the American economy is unraveling. Amazon alone employs a million people. So the question is, will Congress really have the stomach to do anything about this?             </p><p>AILSA CHANG:                 That is NPR's Shannon Bond.             </p><p>                Thank you, Shannon.             </p><p>SHANNON BOND:                 Thanks, Ailsa.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF RONE'S \"NAKT\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-2020072912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-J9D1-DY2S-N327-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

With Facebook in Congress\u2019s crosshairs, America\u2019s leading Internet companies\u2014sometimes known as \u201cbig tech\u201d\u2014arguably face a greater risk of regulation than at any time in their relatively brief history. Despite the political appeal of setting new rules for tech companies, however, cracking down on big Internet platforms won\u2019t meaningfully protect our privacy or safeguard U.S. democracy. Instead, it will entrench existing firms at the expense of innovation and dynamism.  <br/>How Did Cambridge Analytica Collect Data on 87 Million Facebook Users?  <br/>First, what happened with Facebook? Between 2013 and 2015, about 270,000 Facebook users installed a personality quiz app created by Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology researcher affiliated with Cambridge University. Most users were paid a few dollars in exchange for taking the quizzes. Each time a user installed the app, it would request permission to download some of the data that user could access, including the user\u2019s friends list and which pages these friends had \u201cliked.\u201d Given that a typical Facebook user has a few hundred friends, the app managed to glean the likes of roughly 87 million Facebook users living in the United States. A Facebook privacy setting allowed users to prevent their data from being accessed by their friends\u2019 apps, but this setting could be found only in an obscure menu that most users probably never visited.  <br/>Although the app initially collected user data for academic research, Kogan maintains that he changed the app\u2019s terms in 2014 such that it would collect data for \u201ccommercial use.\u201d Regardless of the app\u2019s terms, however, Facebook\u2019s platform policy bars developers from transferring data collected about Facebook users to third parties. In contravention of this policy, Kogan handed over the trove of user information to Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm that used the data to, among other things, try to help Donald Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In 2015, when Facebook realized that Kogan had misappropriated user data, it pulled his app and required that both he and Cambridge Analytica certify that they had destroyed all the data they\u2019d collected.  <br/>In 2015, Facebook overhauled its application programming interface (API), unveiling its \u201cGraph 2.0,\u201d which significantly limited the types of information that apps could extract about their users\u2019 friends. Although apps can still request permission to obtain a list of their users\u2019 friends, and friends\u2019 basic profile information\u2014such as each friend\u2019s birthday, workplace, and education\u2014friends\u2019 detailed information is off limits.  <br/>Where Did Facebook Go Wrong?  <br/>With the benefit of hindsight, it\u2019s easy to see the many ways in which Facebook messed up. Its engineers should have thought twice before creating an API that enabled apps to extract so much data from not only their users, but their users\u2019 friends, too. It should have raised red flags when Kogan changed his app from a research tool to a commercial service. And when Facebook learned that Kogan had shared a ton of user data with Cambridge Analytica, it should have done much more than simply require a \u201ccertification\u201d that the data had been destroyed.  <br/>Facebook has largely admitted this much. In a Q&amp;A recently posted to the company\u2019s website, Mark Zuckerberg owned up to making several mistakes and pledged to more effectively safeguard user privacy in the future. Facebook has also redesigned its privacy settings and announced plans to rewrite its data policy. Facebook\u2019s critics, however, have noted that this is hardly the first time that Zuckerberg has apologized and promised to do better.  <br/>But this saga is far from over. On April 10 and 11, Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify before a joint Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committee hearing and a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing. Cambridge Analytics is under investigation by the British government. And Facebook is reportedly under investigation by the governments of Australia, the United Kingdom, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and several state attorneys general.  <br/>Perhaps the most important of these investigations is the one underway at the FTC, a federal agency that\u2019s empowered to go after U.S. companies that engage in \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d In 2011, the FTC and Facebook entered into a consent order involving various misrepresentations the company allegedly made involving user privacy. In the order, Facebook agreed that it would, among other things, maintain a privacy program designed to protect the confidentiality of user information and obtain users\u2019 \u201caffirmative express consent\u201d before sharing their information with third parties in excess of their privacy settings.  <br/>Now that we know Cambridge Analytica acquired the data of 87 million Facebook users through the platform\u2019s API, did Facebook violate its consent order with the FTC? It\u2019s far from clear, at least based on reporting to date about what happened. Although Facebook is required to prominently tell users whenever it shares their data in a way that \u201cmaterially exceeds\u201d the user\u2019s privacy settings, Kogan\u2019s quiz app gleaned information from users who opted to install the app\u2014and whose friends had, in turn, opted to share their likes, check-ins, and so forth with their friends. If your friends can see something you shared on Facebook, whether it\u2019s a page you liked or a story you shared on your timeline, it follows that your friends\u2019 apps can see that same piece of data. And that\u2019s basically how Facebook\u2019s API functioned at the time.  <br/>Yet for many users, this wasn\u2019t their understanding of how information sharing worked on Facebook. Sharing data you\u2019ve chosen to make visible to your friends is one thing; sharing that data with third-party apps your friends have installed is another matter\u2014and should require separate permissions. This presumption may seem counterintuitive to engineers and data scientists, even if it seems perfectly natural to ordinary users.  <br/>To the extent that users didn\u2019t understand how Facebook\u2019s API functioned, was it because Facebook misrepresented how its platform worked? Or was it simply another manifestation of the disconnect between typical users and engineers, each of whom have a very different perspective when it comes to information sharing on digital platforms? It\u2019s beyond doubt that Facebook could have done more to educate its users about how apps interacted with the service, especially with respect to data shared by a user\u2019s friends. But failing to explain the Graph API is very different from misrepresenting Facebook\u2019s privacy practices.  <br/>What about Facebook\u2019s reliance on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s false statement that it had destroyed the data it collected through Kogan\u2019s app? Facebook could have gone further, perhaps by auditing the company. In hindsight, it\u2019s obvious that Facebook should have done much more to verify the destruction of its users\u2019 information. But Facebook\u2019s naivete with respect to app developers that collected user information looks much less unreasonable.    <br/>We routinely rely on contractual agreements in modern commerce, including when we decide to share information about ourselves with Internet services. When companies share information with other companies, it\u2019s commonplace for both sides to rely on the other party\u2019s representations. Just as businesses sometimes break their promises in the offline world, not every firm that collects information on the Internet is scrupulous. Given that Facebook reportedly had an established relationship with Kogan, perhaps it was not so unreasonable to rely on his certification that neither he nor Cambridge Analytica had retained any user data. If the data had already ended up in the hands of bad actors, it\u2019s not clear if an audit would have even detected the transfer.  <br/>Will the Government Overreact to Facebook\u2019s Mistakes?  <br/>Few people dispute that a company should be punished if it materially deceives its users. But it\u2019s a much tougher case when, say, a social media service\u2014acting in good faith through engineers, designers, lawyers, and so forth\u2014rolls out a data sharing tool that some users don\u2019t fully understand. Second-guessing Facebook\u2019s decisionmaking circa 2015 is easy. But striking the right balance between neat new features and intuitive privacy controls is hard.  <br/>If the FTC slaps Facebook with a fine that could, in theory, exceed a trillion dollars because the company failed to better explain to its users how third-party apps could access their friends\u2019 information would certainly give tech companies a strong incentive to be more careful about user privacy. But the chilling effects of a massive fine might end up deterring beneficial experimentation with new ways to share and use information online. Occasional mistakes are a natural part of the innovative process, and not every mistake warrants governmental intervention.  <br/>Despite the oft-recited refrain that Silicon Valley is in the business of exploiting user data, the world\u2019s most valuable private company\u2014Apple\u2014goes out of its way to tout its track record on privacy protection. In an interview last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook lambasted Facebook and other tech firms for their data practices. But as Mark Zuckerberg observed, the world is full of consumers who can\u2019t afford to pay for expensive devices and subscriptions. There is no \u201cright\u201d business model. Instead, the marketplace puts competing business models to the test every day.  <br/>Regardless of how the government responds, Facebook deserves to pay a market price for its missteps. And it is: The New York Times reported recently that the hashtag #DeleteFacebook appeared on Twitter over 40,000 times in a single day. But users who opt to exit the platform entirely may not be the biggest downside for Facebook. Many more users might stick with the platform but reduce their engagement, share fewer posts, \u201clike\u201d fewer pages, or tighten their privacy settings.  <br/>As members of Congress question Mark Zuckerberg this week, they should keep in mind that he and his Harvard classmates created a platform that\u2019s connected not only the vast majority of Americans, but well over 2 billion people around the world. Now that Facebook is a multi-billion dollar company, it might be able to live with more regulation. But what about the next Facebook? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN728277220180409</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2S-5K91-DXCW-D493-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The story is part of a series about lawmakers' personal financial disclosures. OpenSecrets recently updated its personal finances database[1] to include data from lawmakers' most recent filings released last May.Congress is tasked with regulating the most powerful and influential industries in the private sector. But lawmakers could lose massive chunks of their personal wealth if their legislation hurts those companies' bottom lines. </p><p>In the most recent financial disclosures filed last year, lawmakers reported holding tens of millions of dollars in tech and pharmaceutical stocks. Congress continued to invest in these companies even as it debated how to deal with rising drug prices and tech giants' intrusions of privacy.Some lawmakers like to trade stocks. That fact became evident when Sens. Richard Burr[2] (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler[3] (R-Ga.) unloaded stocks after attending a private briefing that underscored the looming danger of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies are among lawmakers' favorite stocks. As of the most recent financial disclosures, over 50 lawmakers reported investing upwards of six figures in the pharmaceutical and health products industry.On the campaign trail, Rep. Joe Kennedy III[4] (D-Mass.) casts himself as a fighter who takes on big pharma. But his portfolio shows he's profited from rising drug prices. Last year, he reported owning up to $2.1 million in stock in pharmaceutical and health products companies, investing in industry giants such as Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson[5], Merck[6], Abbott Laboratories[7], Eli Lilly &amp;#38; Co[8] and Pfizer[9]. In previous years, Kennedy was the top investor[10] in Gilead Sciences[11], the drugmaker behind a controversially expensive[12] hepatitis medication that is now working on COVID-19 treatment.Kennedy, who is challenging Sen. Ed Markey[13] (D-Mass.), has also come under scrutiny[14] for owning millions in oil company stock[15] while running on climate issues. Kennedy inherited his assets in a family trust, but his 2019 financial disclosure showed his stocks weren't in a blind trust.Pfizer is one of the most popular stocks in Congress, with 48 lawmakers placing their bet on the drugmaker that hikes its prices[16] each year. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner[17] (R-Wis.), the second most senior congressman, reported holding between $1 million and $5 million in Pfizer stock. Forty-seven lawmakers reported investing in Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson, despite the drugmaker's role[18] in the devastating opioid epidemic.The pharmaceutical lobby has successfully defeated bill after bill that would limit the rising price of drugs. The industry coupled record lobbying spending[19] with targeted campaign donations[20] and direct appeals[21] to President Donald Trump[22] to ward off policy changes. Rep. Greg Gianforte[23] (R-Mont.), the wealthiest member of the House, reported investing $3.6 million in pharmaceutical companies. He was the top investor in several industry giants including AbbVie[24], the Humira manufacturer that successfully killed generic competition[25] for nearly two decades and fought off regulation[26] from Congress. Most lawmakers disclose their assets in a wide range, but Gianforte provides transparency by choosing to disclose the exact amount of money he invests in each asset.Gianforte recently purchased stock in companies that might benefit from the COVID-19 pandemic, including Roche Holding AG, which won emergency approval[27] from the federal government to sell an automated COVID-19 test.Tech companies among the most investedSeventy-nine lawmakers reported holding shares of Apple[28], the world's first trillion-dollar company. Apple enjoys investments from members of both parties, but Democrats are the biggest investors in the deep-pocketed iPhone maker.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi[29] (D-Calif.), who represents a San Francisco district that neighbors tech giants, reported owning up to $25.5 million in Apple stocks. Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, runs a venture capital firm that has helped make the Democratic leader one of the wealthiest members of Congress. He made a number of trades[30] involving tech companies during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, including buying shares of Slack Technologies stock.Microsoft[31] is the second-most invested company. Sixty-five lawmakers owned stocks in the tech giant. Rep. Suzan DelBene[32] (D-Wash.), a former Microsoft executive, owned up to $10 million in company stock. Another former Microsoft employee, Rep. Josh Gottheimer[33] (D-N.J.), held up to $5.2 million in Microsoft stock.Tech companies are among the most popular assets for lawmakers, with 42 members invested in Google[34], 37 in Amazon[35] and 34 in Facebook[36] as of the most recent filings. Several ultra-wealthy members of Congress reported significant holdings in all five major tech companies, including Sen. John Hoeven[37] (R-N.D.), a former banker, and Rep. Gil Cisneros[38] (D-Calif.), a lottery winner.Despite investing heavily in tech companies, Congress is making the industry a top target. House Democrats are investigating major tech companies over antitrust issues, while the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are running their own antitrust investigations. Congressional Democrats, including Pelosi, maintained a close relationship[39] with companies like Google and Facebook for several years. But as the industry came under fire over privacy and antitrust issues, influential Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren[40] (D-Mass.) called for tech giants to be broken up[41].Other Democrats reported seven-figure investments in big tech last year. Freshman Rep. Elaine Luria[42] (D-Va.) reported holding up to $5 million in Facebook stock. Rep. Kim Schrier[43] (D-Wash.) reported owning up to $6.3 million in Apple stock, far more than any other investment.Researcher Alex Baumgart contributed to this report.

(Drew Angerer/Getty Images) The story is part of a series about lawmakers' personal financial disclosures. OpenSecrets recently updated its personal finances database[1] to include data from lawmakers' most recent filings released last May.Congress is tasked with regulating the most powerful and influential industries in the private sector. But lawmakers could lose massive chunks of their personal wealth if their legislation hurts those companies' bottom lines. </p><p>In the most recent financial disclosures filed last year, lawmakers reported holding tens of millions of dollars in tech and pharmaceutical stocks. Congress continued to invest in these companies even as it debated how to deal with rising drug prices and tech giants' intrusions of privacy.Some lawmakers like to trade stocks. That fact became evident when Sens. Richard Burr[2] (R-N.C.) and Kelly Loeffler[3] (R-Ga.) unloaded stocks after attending a private briefing that underscored the looming danger of COVID-19. Pharmaceutical companies are among lawmakers' favorite stocks. As of the most recent financial disclosures, over 50 lawmakers reported investing upwards of six figures in the pharmaceutical and health products industry.On the campaign trail, Rep. Joe Kennedy III[4] (D-Mass.) casts himself as a fighter who takes on big pharma. But his portfolio shows he's profited from rising drug prices. Last year, he reported owning up to $2.1 million in stock in pharmaceutical and health products companies, investing in industry giants such as Johnson Johnson[5], Merck[6], Abbott Laboratories[7], Eli Lilly Co[8] and Pfizer[9]. In previous years, Kennedy was the top investor[10] in Gilead Sciences[11], the drugmaker behind a controversially expensive[12] hepatitis medication that is now working on COVID-19 treatment.Kennedy, who is challenging Sen. Ed Markey[13] (D-Mass.), has also come under scrutiny[14] for owning millions in oil company stock[15] while running on climate issues. Kennedy inherited his assets in a family trust, but his 2019 financial disclosure showed his stocks weren't in a blind trust.Pfizer is one of the most popular stocks in Congress, with 48 lawmakers placing their bet on the drugmaker that hikes its prices[16] each year. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner[17] (R-Wis.), the second most senior congressman, reported holding between $1 million and $5 million in Pfizer stock. Forty-seven lawmakers reported investing in Johnson Johnson, despite the drugmaker's role[18] in the devastating opioid epidemic.The pharmaceutical lobby has successfully defeated bill after bill that would limit the rising price of drugs. The industry coupled record lobbying spending[19] with targeted campaign donations[20] and direct appeals[21] to President Donald Trump[22] to ward off policy changes. Rep. Greg Gianforte[23] (R-Mont.), the wealthiest member of the House, reported investing $3.6 million in pharmaceutical companies. He was the top investor in several industry giants including AbbVie[24], the Humira manufacturer that successfully killed generic competition[25] for nearly two decades and fought off regulation[26] from Congress. Most lawmakers disclose their assets in a wide range, but Gianforte provides transparency by choosing to disclose the exact amount of money he invests in each asset.Gianforte recently purchased stock in companies that might benefit from the COVID-19 pandemic, including Roche Holding AG, which won emergency approval[27] from the federal government to sell an automated COVID-19 test.Tech companies among the most investedSeventy-nine lawmakers reported holding shares of Apple[28], the world's first trillion-dollar company. Apple enjoys investments from members of both parties, but Democrats are the biggest investors in the deep-pocketed iPhone maker.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi[29] (D-Calif.), who represents a San Francisco district that neighbors tech giants, reported owning up to $25.5 million in Apple stocks. Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi, runs a venture capital firm that has helped make the Democratic leader one of the wealthiest members of Congress. He made a number of trades[30] involving tech companies during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, including buying shares of Slack Technologies stock.Microsoft[31] is the second-most invested company. Sixty-five lawmakers owned stocks in the tech giant. Rep. Suzan DelBene[32] (D-Wash.), a former Microsoft executive, owned up to $10 million in company stock. Another former Microsoft employee, Rep. Josh Gottheimer[33] (D-N.J.), held up to $5.2 million in Microsoft stock.Tech companies are among the most popular assets for lawmakers, with 42 members invested in Google[34], 37 in Amazon[35] and 34 in Facebook[36] as of the most recent filings. Several ultra-wealthy members of Congress reported significant holdings in all five major tech companies, including Sen. John Hoeven[37] (R-N.D.), a former banker, and Rep. Gil Cisneros[38] (D-Calif.), a lottery winner.Despite investing heavily in tech companies, Congress is making the industry a top target. House Democrats are investigating major tech companies over antitrust issues, while the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are running their own antitrust investigations. Congressional Democrats, including Pelosi, maintained a close relationship[39] with companies like Google and Facebook for several years. But as the industry came under fire over privacy and antitrust issues, influential Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren[40] (D-Mass.) called for tech giants to be broken up[41].Other Democrats reported seven-figure investments in big tech last year. Freshman Rep. Elaine Luria[42] (D-Va.) reported holding up to $5 million in Facebook stock. Rep. Kim Schrier[43] (D-Wash.) reported owning up to $6.3 million in Apple stock, far more than any other investment.Researcher Alex Baumgart contributed to this report.

The winner will face off against the Democratic Primary winner to replace Republican Rep. Phil Roe, who is retiring after this congressional term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The candidates in attendance were: Jay Adkins, Richard Baker, Chance Cansler, John Clark, state Sen. Rusty Crowe, Steve Darden, Josh Gapp, state Rep. David Hawk, Chuck Miller, Carter Quillen and Nichole Williams.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Adkins, who served in the 278th Armored Cavalry, said he would focus on bringing jobs to the district. He worked as a machinist before getting an engineering degree and believes his experiences will help him identify how to bring quality jobs to the district.</p><p> \"We can say we are going to give tax credits. We can build industrial parks. But the reality is we are not going to be have any jobs come here until we have a highly skilled workforce, and that is what I'm going to do for the district,\" Adkins said.</p><p> Baker, a devout Christian, said his focus would be getting abortion law overturned.</p><p> \"I want to get in a position where I can orchestrate getting the Supreme Court to rehear Roe v. Wade and throw it out!\" he exclaimed.</p><p> He also felt people losing their property because of an inability to pay property tax is wrong and called it unconstitutional and unbiblical.</p><p> The youngest candidate on the ticket, 25-year-old Cansler, also addressed abortion. He advocated for making adoption easier and simpler.</p><p> He also was concerned about the Second Amendment, specifically how different states had different gun laws that restrict the right to bear arms. He wanted to make sure people's Second Amendment rights are protected even across state lines.</p><p> \"We should make sure at the federal level we are clamping down on that unconstitutional behavior,\" Cansler said.</p><p> Many in Sevier may feel the county is overlooked in district one, but Crowe said he was aware of how important it was to the district and the entire state.</p><p> \"I know, having worked in the senate for many years, just how valuable Sevier County is to Tennessee, our great state,\" Crowe said.</p><p> Crowe said Tennessee is the envy of the nation right now.</p><p> \"It is because we have followed those good old conservative Tennessee, Sevier County values of low taxes, less government intrusion, less government regulation, personal responsibility, faith and family,\" Crowe said.</p><p> He wants to take those values to Washington.</p><p> \"Lord knows we need some good old Tennessee values and principles up there,\" he said.</p><p> Darden, a one time Johnson City mayor, spoke of his experience in economic development in the Tri-cities and surrounding area.</p><p> \"I plan to work with all the local folks who are involved in economic development to help ensure that our future is bright for those who are seeking jobs,\" Darden said.</p><p> He also spoke of constituent services, and he spoke of using his professionalism to tackle problems, referring to his experience as a small business owner with a law firm and a mediator.</p><p> Gapp, who went from a trailer park to a physician with practices in Johnson City and Knoxville, said there is one thing that is hurting America.</p><p> \"I can tell you political correctness has become a cancer in our system,\" Gapp said. \"Right now we need strong leadership more than ever to stand up to the politically correct crowd.\"</p><p> Hawk is a Greene County businessman who put himself through college working at the family store.</p><p> He noted everyone on stage would be for certain issues \u2014 pro President Trump and Second Amendment and anti-abortion.</p><p> \"Those are easy issues for us, but there are hundreds of other issues your Congressman is going to have to vote on when we get to Washington and those decisions are not going to be easy,\" Hawk said.</p><p> One of those is how to deal with the federal deficit.</p><p> Hawk has experience with balancing budgets as a member of the budget committee at the state level.</p><p> \"I know how to balance a budget. I want to bring that skillset with me to Washington.\"</p><p> Miller has an engineering background and also brings knowledge of manufacturing to the table.</p><p> \"I know what you need as far as technical skills. We need to bring the trade schools back, because that is really the education 80% of the people need to have,\" Miller said.</p><p> Miller also supported term limits and said he would serve no more than three terms.</p><p> Quillen is a registered professional engineer who joined the Coast Guard at 17, using the G.I. Bill for getting a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.</p><p> \"Legislation is essentially a contract between the government and the people and how we all agree to live together. You can put all the legalese you want in any contract but the most important ingredient for success is trust between all the parties. People have lost trust in the Congress because it fails to implement their will, instead caters to special interest to produce policies that hurt the average citizen,\" Quillen said.</p><p> \"I want to help restore that trust in the Congress again by faithfully adhering to the Constitution and honestly performing the duties of the office for the benefit of all the people, not just a few powerful groups.\"</p><p> Nichole Williams supported undoing a lot of things implemented by the federal government. She was inspired to run first when she saw people in New York celebrating legislation that protected late term abortions.</p><p> She then thought if \"The Squad\" \u2014 the informal name for Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 could be in office she could to.</p><p> \"Sevier County is very very important to me and I understand the importance of you to our district,\" Williams said.</p><p> Williams said Congress is only supposed to uphold the Constitution and be a voice for their constituency.</p><p> She took issue with the 16th and 17th Amendments, which created the Federal Reserve and made the Senate elections a general election.</p><p> She also didn't like the New Deal, which President Roosevelt used to help people after the Great Depression. She said it was the beginning of a platform to introduce socialism.</p><p> \"I would support repealing about 75% of FDR's New Deal,\" Williams said.</p><p> She also supported the Second Amendment, believing people should be able to access the same weaponry as the military, even tanks.</p><p> Candidates were asked about a variety of issues, including how they would address the COVID-19 pandemic and what they thought could be done to support the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.</p><p> All candidates across the board supported bringing back the pharmaceutical industry from China so America can have a safe and secure supply chain.</p><p> Quillen said he supported testing, getting good data so decisions can be made and a vaccine developed.</p><p> \"Until we either get a vaccine or an effective therapy this crisis is going to linger. It is going to continue so we need to have a laser like focus in Congress. We need to get a vaccine and \u2014 as Chance was saying \u2014 cut back the red tape and regulations holding us back,\" said Gapp.</p><p> Williams said she'd stop the modern day \"book burning\" by big tech, noting the removal of videos of information on a drug that may be a treatment for COVID-19.</p><p> \"Diagnostics is important. We have got to come up with a test that has results quicker. We have to focus on jobs, rebooting the economy,\" Crowe said.</p><p> When asked about the national park, candidates had mixed opinions on way to support it. Some supported a fee like other national parks have.</p><p> Baker supported a small fee or events that could be used for fundraising.</p><p> Cansler said he didn't think a small fee would be out of line.</p><p> \"Again, not something burdensome so they wouldn't come, but just a small fee that would help repair this place that is so special to us ...\" Cansler said.</p><p> \"I think we should charge folks who are from out of state who want to take advantage of that asset,\" Clark said.</p><p> Williams agreed with that sentiment.</p><p> Williams said she was against the federal government and is for abolishing the National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management. She believes the land should belong to the state.</p><p> Others were against a fee, including Quillen.</p><p> \"I disagree with fees. I think that is a mistake,\" Quillen said.</p><p> He also disagreed with doing away with the NPS and Bureau of Land Management and also disagreed with logging and other measures.</p><p> Hawk also was against a fee.</p><p> \"We don't need a fee on cars that come into our Great Smoky Mountains National Park. One of the reasons we have twice as many visitors to the Smokies as any other national park is because we are accessible to the rest of the world,\" Hawk said.</p><p> Adkins was against a fee, calling it another tax, which he said Republicans should be against.</p><p> \"To say we are going to add another tax or fee just to enjoy our property just seems to go against the principles of this party and this country,\" Adkins said.</p><p> Darden said he reached out to Superintendent Cassius Cash, who he called a huge asset to the park.</p><p> He praised existing groups who raise money for the park but said it needs additional funding sources.</p><p> Crowe said he thinks stewardship of the park is a priority and should continue.</p><p> Gapp believes focusing on the economy should be a priority and will bring tourists back to the county and the national park. He also thinks the tourism industry and park should work together to do something that helps both.</p><p> Find the full debate on Facebook at <url normalizedValue=\"https://tinyurl.com/y4zlur2a\">https://tinyurl.com/y4zlur2a</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-03a8cacc41216d0317c4a8b93b236f73b42d7e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A4D514062E6 NWBKTN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-V3C1-JBCN-41YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Mountain Press (Sevierville, TN)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Frank[1] Because of already passed state[2] and federal legislation[3], A LOT more 4G and 5G[4] small cell towers and infrastructure[5] are being installed all over the U.S in front of homes and everywhere else. This is in addition to the countless other small and mega 4G cell towers that have already been installed near homes and throughout communities over the last few years. Small cell towers[6] and infrastructure aren't always easily recognizable. </p><p>This is why many Americans are still completely unaware about all of this. Regardless, where Americans are aware, there has been increasing vocal opposition[7] to installation due to biological[8], environmental[9], and safety risks as well as reduced property value[10] and increased privacy and cybersecurity[11] concerns. There now also finally seems to be a 'better late than never' investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee about this horrible federal legislation.From RCR Wireless:[12]House committee investigates FCC over 5G infrastructure order The House Energy and Commerce committee has asked the Federal Communications Commission to produce communications records between FCC employees and network operators related to the commission's recent order preempting local control and pricing of infrastructure access, alleging that FCC representatives may have acted improperly in support of an initiative that is likely to save operators billions in 5G deployment costs. 'It has come to our attention that certain individuals at the FCC may have urged companies to challenge the order the commission adopted in order to game the judicial lottery procedure and intimated the agency would look unfavorably toward entities that were not helpful,' wrote committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-New Jersey) and Mike Doyle (D-Pennsylvania), chairman of the subcommittee on communications and technology, in a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai[13]. 'If true, it would be inappropriate for the FCC to leverage its power as a regulator to influence regulated companies to further its agenda in seeking a more friendly court.' The FCC order focused on easing deployment of 5G infrastructure. The primary tenets of the FCC's order included: Banning local regulations designed to prohibit wireless infrastructure deployment; Standardizing the fee structure cities can charge for reviewing small cell projects; Establishing a 60-day shot clock for attaching small cells to existing structures and 90 days for new builds; And setting 'modest guardrailson other municipal rules that may prohibit service.' The order drew immediate protests from some civic leaders[14] that the FCC was overstepping its bounds and undercutting local control of infrastructure issues. It went into effect on Jan. 14th[15], after surviving a legal challenge from some municipalities that questioned the FCC's authority in the case. But four network operators sued as well, arguing that the FCC did not go far enough in removing infrastructure deployment barriers \u2014 AT...for instance, complained that the FCC had refused to adopt the stance that infrastructure placement would be 'deemed granted' when a state or local government entity failed to act on an access request within a reasonable amount of time \u2014 and they filed in four different federal courts. AT...ued in the D.C. circuit court; Verizon in the Second Circuit court, which covers New York, Connecticut and Vermont; Sprint filed in the Tenth Circuit, which covers a number of Midwest and Western states from Kansas to Utah and Arizona; and Puerto Rico Telephone Company[16] filed in the First Circuit court, which has jurisdiction over the territory as well as several Northeastern U.S. states. Meanwhile, cities and municipalities had filed legal protests against the FCC's action in the Ninth Circuit, which covers West Coast states including California. A lottery procedure consolidating the cases, triggered by the filing of the cases in multiple federal court districts, initially moved the cases into the Tenth Circuit. A motion from the municipal parties moved it back to the Ninth Circuit, according to the letter from House Democrats.Download Your First Issue Free!

Download Your Free Copy of Counter MarketsThe House committee asked Pai for documents related to whether the FCC had communications with FCC licensees related to the legal challenges (or potential legal challenges) of the infrastructure order; which people were involved in those communications, and whether anyone at the FCC urged a network operator to pursue a legal challenge. The committee also wants to know if anyone at the FCC has 'threatened or taken adverse action' against licensees who refused to challenge the order, including delaying items or issues of interest to the licensees. RCR Wireless News has reached out to the FCC \u2014 which is back to work after the prolonged partial government shutdown \u2014 for comment.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to protect the public[17] by regulating the Telecom Industry. They have been doing the exact opposite for many years already and are considered to be a 'Captured Agency[18].' This has only become worse over the last few years due to the 'Race for 5G[19]'. See 1[20], 2[21], 3[22], 4[23], 5[24], 6[25], 7[26] Many elected officials have taken boatloads of money[27] from the telecom[28], cable, and tech industries, so they are 'captured' as well. Fortunately, some 'better late than never' efforts have been initiated by a few of them recently anyway. See 1[29], 2[30], 3[31], 4[32], 5[33], 6[34], 7[35] So 'better late than never' is a relief for those of us who don't already have harmful wireless radiating small cell towers and infrastructure[36] installed near our homes and throughout our communities. But what about for Americans who already do? For them -'better late than never' isn't just lame - it's tragic.

The daylong virtual hearing, held by the House Judiciary Committee, was primarily focused on the ostensible monopoly power held by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, most of whom have growing, if sometimes indirect, footprints in the K-12 sector. \"Their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power,\" said Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the committee's Democratic chairperson. \"Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\" The Judiciary Committee is in the midst of a year-long investigation that is expected to yield a scathing report about the anti-competitive practices of the tech giants. The Department of Justice is also said to be pursuing an antitrust suit against Google.  Among the accusations that flew during last Wednesday's hearing: Amazon was criticized for using its massive online platform to determine which other products sell well, then undercutting them with its own private-label alternatives. Apple was accused of using its popular App Store to punish rivals to services the company itself offers. Facebook was slammed for making corporate acquisitions in order to \"neutralize a competitor,\" words taken from one of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's own emails, collected by the committee as part of its investigation. Google was pressed on favoring its own pages and products in search and advertising. Like Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, and Google's Sundar Pichai, Zuckerberg of Facebook defended his company vigorously. \"We compete hard. We compete fairly. We try to be the best,\" he said. Here are four issues from the hearing for the K-12 sector to keep an eye on: 1.    Tech companies controlling markets to which their own products have privileged access This is the biggest complaint against the tech titans. The general argument is that because technology companies control \"essential infrastructure\" (think Amazon's online marketplace, or Google's online search engine), they are able to give their own products and services unfair advantages while controlling the extent to which consumers and other companies can find and do business with each other.  The implications stretch across nearly every sector of society. One example, raised by Rep. Lucy McBath, Democrat from Georgia: At the same time Apple released its Screen Time feature, it allegedly removed from its app store a number of third-party apps that provided similar functionality. Schools are also affected by this dynamic, maintained Doug Levin of EdTech Strategies. He said the current marketplace resembles a \"feudal system\" in which school district IT administrators often work to align their technology offerings to the products and services of a single big tech provider. Such an approach may be convenient and come with some benefits, but it also can leave districts \"beholden to the changing whims and aims of their masters,\" Levin said. Among the drawbacks: \"Significant risk to cost containment, choice of solution provider, control over data privacy and security, and interoperability,\" he argued. 2. Pandemic profiteering? Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler of New York leveled this charge at Tim Cook of Apple, specifically raising schools as a potential area where the company might \"extract commissions\" from businesses that change their models from in-person to online amid coronavirus-related shutdowns and closures. \"School is about to start around the country and millions of parents and students will attend school online. They will rely on apps to talk to teachers, tutors and virtual learning tools. Are these online learning tools...next on Apple's list to monetize?\" Nadler said. Cook denied the charge, saying Apple's commission model has long been in place and is a good deal for developers seeking access to the App Store. The Software and Information Industry Association declined to comment on whether they've seen any evidence of Apple charging exorbitant or unusual commissions to ed-tech services trying to move into the app store in recent months. 3. The possibility of big tech companies' acquisition strategies quashing innovation It was Facebook that found itself in Congress's crosshairs on this issue, particularly with regard to its 2012 purchase of Instagram, \"exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said. The concern is that big companies gobbling up potential competitors before they can get a foothold stifles innovation. The same dynamic is at play in the K-12 market, said Levin of EdTech Strategies, although Silicon Valley's Big Four aren't often directly involved. \"The ed-tech market is made up of many small companies and only a handful of large ones, who are still dwarfed in size by those who participated in the hearing,\" he said. \"Given the ability of these outsized players to influence the market in which smaller companies operate, to say nothing of the risk that they might choose to directly compete with promising new entrants and sustain an operating loss indefinitely while doing so, special risks are borne by those seeking to truly offer innovative new products.\" 4. How the flow of misinformation about COVID-19 might shape the debate about school reopenings While Wednesday's focus was mostly on tech companies' monopoly power, several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee chose to instead level complaints that Facebook and Google, in particular, were censoring conservative viewpoints on social media. That quickly veered into an acrimonious conversation over the companies' proper role in managing the flow of information, and misinformation, related to COVID-19 and the politically charged issue of whether to restart in-person schooling this fall. Take this statement, from Representative Greg Steube, Republican from Florida. \"There are rioting groups that are going unchecked with the posting of what I would contend is very violent video, yet yesterday I was sent a YouTube video about doctors discussing hydroxychloroquine and discussing the dangers of children not returning to school, and when I clicked on the link, it was taken down...How can doctors giving their opinion on a drug they think is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 and doctors who think it's appropriate for children to return back to school violate YouTube's community guidelines when all of these videos of violence is [sic] all posted on YouTube?\" Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, through which YouTube operates as a subsidiary, said the company believes in freedom of expression and allows \"robust debate,\" but will remove videos that explicitly state something is a proven cure for COVID-19 when that claim does not meet CDC guidelines. Is misinformation about COVID-19, or tech companies' decision to remove it from platforms such as YouTube, making states' and school districts' decisions about whether and how to reopen schools more difficult?

The daylong virtual hearing , held by the House Judiciary Committee, was primarily focused on the ostensible monopoly power held by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, most of whom have growing, if sometimes indirect, footprints in the K-12 sector.    \"Their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power,\" said Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the committee's Democratic chairperson. \"Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\"    The Judiciary Committee is in the midst of a year-long investigation that is expected to yield a scathing report about the anti-competitive practices of the tech giants. The Department of Justice is also said to be pursuing an antitrust suit against Google .     Among the accusations that flew during last Wednesday's hearing:    Amazon was criticized for using its massive online platform to determine which other products sell well, then undercutting them with its own private-label alternatives.  Apple was accused of using its popular App Store to punish rivals to services the company itself offers.  Facebook was slammed for making corporate acquisitions in order to \"neutralize a competitor,\" words taken from one of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's own emails , collected by the committee as part of its investigation.  Google was pressed on favoring its own pages and products in search and advertising.    Like Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, and Google's Sundar Pichai, Zuckerberg of Facebook defended his company vigorously.    \"We compete hard. We compete fairly. We try to be the best,\" he said.    Here are four issues from the hearing for the K-12 sector to keep an eye on:     1.    Tech companies controlling markets to which their own products have privileged access    This is the biggest complaint against the tech titans. The general argument is that because technology companies control \"essential infrastructure\" (think Amazon's online marketplace, or Google's online search engine), they are able to give their own products and services unfair advantages while controlling the extent to which consumers and other companies can find and do business with each other.  The implications stretch across nearly every sector of society.    One example, raised by Rep. Lucy McBath, Democrat from Georgia: At the same time Apple released its Screen Time feature, it allegedly removed from its app store a number of third-party apps that provided similar functionality.    Schools are also affected by this dynamic, maintained Doug Levin of EdTech Strategies. He said the current marketplace resembles a \"feudal system\" in which school district IT administrators often work to align their technology offerings to the products and services of a single big tech provider. Such an approach may be convenient and come with some benefits, but it also can leave districts \"beholden to the changing whims and aims of their masters,\" Levin said.    Among the drawbacks: \"Significant risk to cost containment, choice of solution provider, control over data privacy and security, and interoperability,\" he argued.    2.   Pandemic profiteering?    Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler of New York leveled this charge at Tim Cook of Apple, specifically raising schools as a potential area where the company might \"extract commissions\" from businesses that change their models from in-person to online amid coronavirus-related shutdowns and closures.    \"School is about to start around the country and millions of parents and students will attend school online. They will rely on apps to talk to teachers, tutors and virtual learning tools. Are these online learning tools...next on Apple's list to monetize?\" Nadler said.    Cook denied the charge, saying Apple's commission model has long been in place and is a good deal for developers seeking access to the App Store.    The Software and Information Industry Association declined to comment on whether they've seen any evidence of Apple charging exorbitant or unusual commissions to ed-tech services trying to move into the app store in recent months.    3. The  possibility of big tech companies' acquisition strategies quashing innovation    It was Facebook that found itself in Congress's crosshairs on this issue, particularly with regard to its 2012 purchase of Instagram, \"exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said. The concern is that big companies gobbling up potential competitors before they can get a foothold stifles innovation.    The same dynamic is at play in the K-12 market, said Levin of EdTech Strategies, although Silicon Valley's Big Four aren't often directly involved.    \"The ed-tech market is made up of many small companies and only a handful of large ones, who are still dwarfed in size by those who participated in the hearing,\" he said. \"Given the ability of these outsized players to influence the market in which smaller companies operate, to say nothing of the risk that they might choose to directly compete with promising new entrants and sustain an operating loss indefinitely while doing so, special risks are borne by those seeking to truly offer innovative new products.\"    4. How  the flow of misinformation about COVID-19 might shape the debate about school reopenings    While Wednesday's focus was mostly on tech companies' monopoly power, several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee chose to instead level complaints that Facebook and Google, in particular, were censoring conservative viewpoints on social media. That quickly veered into an acrimonious conversation over the companies' proper role in managing the flow of information, and misinformation, related to COVID-19 and the politically charged issue of whether to restart in-person schooling this fall.    Take this statement, from Representative Greg Steube, Republican from Florida.     \" There are rioting groups that are going unchecked with the posting of what I would contend is very violent video, yet yesterday I was sent a YouTube video about doctors discussing hydroxychloroquine and discussing the dangers of children not returning to school, and when I clicked on the link, it was taken down...How can doctors giving their opinion on a drug they think is effective for the treatment of COVID-19 and doctors who think it's appropriate for children to return back to school violate YouTube's community guidelines when all of these videos of violence is [sic] all posted on YouTube?\"     Pichai, the CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, through which YouTube operates as a subsidiary, said the company believes in freedom of expression and allows \"robust debate,\" but will remove videos that explicitly state something is a proven cure for COVID-19 when that claim does not meet CDC guidelines.    Is misinformation about COVID-19, or tech companies' decision to remove it from platforms such as YouTube, making states' and school districts' decisions about whether and how to reopen schools more difficult?    Both the Council of Chief State School Officers and AASA, the Superintendents' Association, declined to comment.    Image :  J.

Here are excerpts of the report issued on Sept. 9 and written by David W. Perkins, specialist in macroeconomic policy:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industrial loan companies (ILCs)--financial institutions chartered by a small number of states-- operate in almost every way like a commercial bank, including taking deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In many ways, ILCs are subject to the same laws and regulations as all state banks; however, notable differences between the rules applicable to the parent holding companies of ILCs and those applicable to bank holding companies have made ILCs the subject of long-standing debate. Recent efforts by technology-focused financial services companies (financial technology or \"fintech\" companies) to establish new ILCs have elevated the visibility of ILC policy issues.</p><p>The ILC segment of the FDIC-insured depository industry is relatively small; as of March 31, 2020, 23 ILCs were operating in 5 states. Their combined assets made up less than 1% of all FDIC-insured institutions' combined total assets. This small segment draws attention because ILCs are, provided they meet certain criteria, excluded from the definition of a bank under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA; P.L.84-511). As a result, parent companies that own ILCs are not prohibited from operating industrial or commercial enterprises (i.e., companies producing or selling nonfinancial goods and services) and are not subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve, as are bank holding companies.</p><p>Opponents of the BHCA exemption argue that this exemption allows for a blending of banking and commerce that U.S. policy generally has sought to avoid. In their view, the blending of banking and commerce creates incentives for imprudent underwriting, inappropriately extends government-backed bank safety nets, and increases opportunities for companies to exercise distortionary market power. In addition, opponents argue that lack of Federal Reserve supervision of ILCs results in inadequate regulatory oversight, placing banks and their holding companies at a disadvantage. Proponents argue that ILCs allow for a degree of banking and commerce blending that, on net, is beneficial, allowing organizations to realize economies of scope and information efficiencies, diversify risks, provide customer convenience, and increase the availability of credit and financial services. Proponents also argue that existing FDIC and state-level regulation and supervision are sufficient to mitigate risks.</p><p>Policymakers periodically have addressed ILC-related issues since the 1910s. Early on, states enacted ILC-related laws; these laws were not uniform, and some states permitted ILCs to take deposits. After the FDIC was established in 1933, it granted deposit insurance to ILCs on a case-by-case basis, depending on the state laws applicable to and practices of the individual ILCs. Over time, the differences between banks and ILCs narrowed, leading to calls for FDIC insurance to be more widely available to insure deposits at ILCs. The Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act (P.L. 97-320) explicitly made ILCs eligible for FDIC insurance in 1982, and states began requiring ILCs to be FDIC-insured. The current regulatory framework for ILCs was in large part shaped by the Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA; P.L. 100-86) in 1987, as the law exempted an ILC's parent from the BHCA, thus creating the avenue for commercial enterprises to own an institution that could offer FDIC-insured deposits.</p><p>Efforts by Walmart and The Home Depot to own ILCs in the mid-2000s resulted in widespread objections related to fears that large retailers would exercise anticompetitive market power. These objections led to two official moratoriums on FDIC insurance approvals for ILCs spanning from 2006 to 2008 (as implemented by the FDIC) and from 2010 to 2013 (as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act [P.L. 111-203]). The debate has been reignited by recent applications, including one by a large Japanese retailer. In March 2020, the FDIC approved two new ILC applications and issued a proposed rule on ILC applications.</p><p>As these developments unfold, Congress may consider ILC-related issues. If Congress were to decide to restrict ILCs, then making new ILCs ineligible for FDIC insurance, repealing the BHCA exemption, or partially amending aspects of their current regulation could be options with varying degrees of restriction. For example, S. 2839 would subject ILC holding companies to Federal Reserve supervision and prohibit commercial firms from becoming ILC holding companies. Were Congress to decide it does not want to restrict ILCs or hinder their establishment, it could expand ILC access to FDIC insurance, perhaps by placing requirements on the FDIC to grant insurance if certain conditions are met. If Congress wanted to prevent the establishment of new ILCs while it considers the issues at hand, it could implement another moratorium.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents:</p><p>Introduction ... 1</p><p>Overview of Industrial Loan Companies ... 2</p><p>Policy Issues Raised by ILCs ... 4</p><p>* Separation of Banking and Commerce Policy Debate ... 4</p><p>- Arguments for Strict Separation ... 4</p><p>- Arguments Against Strict Separation ... 5</p><p>* Different Regulatory Treatment Policy Debate ... 6</p><p>Development of ILC Regulation ... 7</p><p>* Before Federal Deposit Insurance: 1910-1933 ... 7</p><p>* Deposit Insurance Based on FDIC Interpretation: 1933-1982 ... 8</p><p>* ILC Eligibility Depending on State: 1982-1987 ... 8</p><p>* Current Regulatory Framework: 1987-Present ... 9</p><p>Recent Controversies and Developments ... 10</p><p>* Controversial Applications and Official Moratoriums: 2005-2013 ... 10</p><p>* Post-Moratorium Limbo: 2013-2019 ... 11</p><p>* Latest Developments ... 13</p><p>- Nelnet and Square Approved ... 13</p><p>- FDIC Proposed Rulemaking ... 14</p><p>- Rakuten Application and Potential of Future Big Tech ... 15</p><p>Selected Possible Legislative Alternatives ... 16</p><p>Tables:</p><p>Table 1.

ILCs are state-chartered institutions that can be, depending on the state, allowed to make loans, process payments, and take deposits insured by the FDIC./1</p><p>In short, ILCs provide bank services. Certain ILC applications--and the FDIC's approval of two ILC applications in March 2020--have reignited a policy debate over whether aspects of ILC regulation contravene long-standing U.S. banking policy.</p><p>ILCs are controversial because under the Banking Holding Company Act (BHCA; P.L. 84-511), they are exempt from the definition of a bank,/2 allowing a degree of blending of a banking enterprise and a commerce enterprise. The BHCA generally subjects companies that own banks to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve and prohibits them from owning nonfinancial enterprises./3</p><p>Because ILCs are exempt from the definition of a bank under the BHCA, ILC parent companies are not subject to the prohibition against commercial ownership or to Federal Reserve supervision.</p><p>Since at least as far back as the Glass-Steagall Act (Sections 20, 21, 26, and 32 of The Banking Act of 1933; P.L. 73-66), Congress generally has sought to separate banking enterprises that take deposits and make loans from commercial enterprises producing and selling goods and services.</p><p>The rationale for this policy is to prevent various potential negative outcomes, including an increased occurrence of imprudent lending backed by government safety nets and an increased likelihood of organizations exercising distortionary market power./4</p><p>On the other hand, those who favor ILCs discount arguments for strict separation of banking and commerce and maintain that these mixed enterprises provide potential benefits--including economies of scope, risk diversification, information efficiencies, and customer convenience--that could exceed the potential costs resulting from the extension of government safety nets and reduced competition./5</p><p>This report examines ILCs and related policy issues. It begins with an overview of ILCs and the current state of the industry. Next, the report examines the policy issues raised by ILCs. It then summarizes the current regulatory framework's development and examines industry and policy developments since 2005. These developments include the FDIC's and Congress's implementation of moratoriums on new ILC approvals and recent developments involving fintech companies. The report concludes with brief descriptions of selected, possible legislative alternatives.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Overview of Industrial Loan Companies</p><p>ILCs are financial institutions chartered in a small number of states--currently, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, and Utah/6--that are permitted to make a wide array of loan types, offer most types of deposit accounts, and open branches across state lines. Except for a federal law that technically restricts their ability to offer checking accounts (discussed later in this section), they, in effect, act as full service banks. As is the case with traditional banks, an ILC may be owned by a parent holding company./7</p><p>In general, the regulation of banks and ILCs, where it relates directly to the insured depository, are similar./8</p><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act; P.L. 81-797) defines \"state bank\" to include ILCs./9</p><p>As with any state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC is the primary federal regulator of ILCs and supervises them along with the chartering state's bank agency. (Currently, there are no ILC members of the Federal Reserve System.) As a result, state bank regulators and the FDIC subject state-chartered banks and ILCs to supervision and regulation, including safety and soundness requirements (e.g., capital standards and restrictions on transactions with insiders), as well as compliance with federal consumer protection, community reinvestment, and anti-money laundering laws./10</p><p>Certain federal laws and regulations that apply to bank holding companies (BHCs) also apply to ILC holding companies: notably, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (P.L. 663-43) prohibiting or restricting certain transactions between banks and their affiliates./11</p><p>In addition, under Section 38A of the FDI Act, as amended by Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank; P.L. 111-203), the FDIC must require the parent company of an ILC to \"serve as a source of financial strength\" for the depository ILC./12</p><p>These similarities aside, the regulation of the parent holding companies of banks and ILCs differ in a significant way. Under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA; P.L.84-511), a parent company that owns a bank, as defined in that act, is designated as a BHC./13</p><p>BHCs are generally prohibited from owning nonfinancial enterprises/14 and are subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve./15</p><p>ILCs that meet certain criteria are exempt from the BHCA definition of a bank./16</p><p>Thus, parent companies that own an ILC are not designated as BHCs and are not subject to prohibitions against commercial activity or to the Federal Reserve's direct supervision./17</p><p>To qualify for the BHCA exemption, ILCs cannot offer demand deposits (i.e., checking accounts or other deposits that the depository institution generally must make available to the depositor for withdrawal within less than seven days' notice)./18</p><p>Instead, ILCs generally offer negotiable order of withdraw (NOW) accounts. NOW accounts are not considered demand deposits because the depository reserves the right to require seven days' notice or more to transfer the funds./19</p><p>In practice, ILCs may choose to make funds available upon request and not avail themselves of the allowable seven days. Thus, a NOW account functions as a checking account from the perspective of an ILC customer, although it is not technically a demand deposit account./20</p><p>As of the end of the first quarter of 2020, there were 23 FDIC-insured ILCs chartered in 5 states, 14 of which were chartered in Utah./21</p><p>As shown in Table 1, these ILCs collectively held almost $165 billion in assets and $135 billion in deposits; both amounts are less than 1% of the total amount held by all insured depositories./22</p><p>Some of these ILCs are owned by parent companies that are primarily involved in finance, including large organizations like UBS (a non-U.S. bank) and Sallie Mae (a student loan company). Nonfinancial commercial companies, including Toyota and BMW, own others. Some ILCs are small, niche lenders. For example, Medallion Bank specializes in loans for taxi cab \"medallions\"--licenses to operate taxis issued by large cities-- and EnerBank is owned by a home construction company and makes construction loans.</p><p>Currently, the ILC industry is relatively smaller than it has been at other times in recent history, although it has always been smaller compared with the overall depository industry. For example, there were 54 FDIC-insured ILCs with nearly $264 billion in assets in 2007./23</p><p>The industry shrunk following the 2007-2009 financial crisis for numerous reasons. Companies such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and General Motors converted their ILCs to commercial banks during the crisis and became BHCs. Other ILCs voluntarily closed, including those owned by GE and Target, and two small ILCs failed./24</p><p>However, there are recent indications that there may be a resurgence of interest in establishing ILCs, including among technology-focused companies (as discussed in the \"Latest Developments\" section, below).</p><p>Table 1. Industrial Loan Company (ILC) Number, Assets, and Deposits, by State</p><p>Table omitted: <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46489\">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46489</url></p><p>Policy Issues Raised by ILCs</p><p>ILC debates primarily involve two policy issues. One is related to the general separation of banking and commerce. ILC opponents often argue that the ownership of deposit-taking ILCs by commercial enterprises allows too much blending of activities and too many associated risks.</p><p>Proponents often argue that there are important benefits of ILCs as operated under current laws and regulations, and that ILCs as financial services providers are appropriately regulated. The other issue is the related question of whether parent companies that own ILCs should be subject to Federal Reserve supervision, as BHCs are. This section examines these policy issues.</p><p>Separation of Banking and Commerce Policy Debate</p><p>Historically, the United States has adopted policies that separate banking enterprises from commercial enterprises. These policies serve to prevent various interrelated outcomes, described below.</p><p>Arguments for Strict Separation</p><p>One potential issue with mixing banking and commerce within a single organization is that the bank subsidiary could have incentives to make decisions based on the interests of the larger organization, instead of on safe and sound banking principles./25</p><p>For example, a consumer who wishes to remodel his kitchen may need to take out a loan to buy appliances and fixtures from a retail company. If the consumer were to apply for the loan at a stand-alone bank, whether or not the bank would make the loan and under what terms depends largely on the applicant's ability to repay. If the consumer were to apply for a loan at a bank owned by the retailer, the retailer would make an immediate profit on the sale of the goods, and the retailer-owned bank would later make profit on the loan repayment. Thus, the retailer-owned bank would have incentive to make loans to riskier borrowers and at lower interest rates compared with the stand-alone bank. This logic would apply to any scenario in which a bank owned by a commercial parent receives loan applications from the parent's customers and suppliers.</p><p>A retailer or other commercial enterprise making a loan may not be considered problematic per se. Whether a company can make profit by lending to its customers or suppliers is a matter of market forces and does not necessarily raise policy concerns--even if the loans are riskier and default at a higher rate. Concerns arise when the enterprise is allowed to raise funding by accepting government-backed deposits. Protecting depositories from possible negative effects of risk-taking--and thus introducing what is known as moral hazard--removes certain market incentives that constrain risk-taking (see the \"Deposit Insurance Based on FDIC Interpretation: 1933-1982\" section, below). One main rationale for extending government guarantees to banks is that bank failures are especially harmful economically and socially, as they expose individuals seeking to keep their money safe--as opposed to investing for returns--to losses. In contrast, commercial enterprises generally are not given government support because their failures are seen as less disruptive and impose losses on return-seeking, risk-accepting investors./26</p><p>For these reasons, proponents of separating banking and commerce argue that separation prevents an inappropriate extension of bank safety nets to commercial enterprises./27</p><p>Another potential issue with combined banking and commerce enterprises is that their in-house bank operations could increase opportunities for the enterprises to achieve the size and financial resources necessary to exercise anticompetitive market power./28</p><p>Returning to the comparison between the stand-alone bank and a retailer-owned bank, if the retailer-owned bank were able to make loans at a lower interest rate, then it could be difficult for the stand-alone bank to compete.</p><p>Similarly, a retailer that does not own a bank and fund loans to customers with government backed deposits may have difficulty competing with a retailer that does. Where blending is allowed, these economies of scale and scope may naturally lead to large conglomerates with the ability to exercise market power, potentially stifling competition and charging consumers prices higher than free market prices.</p><p>Arguments Against Strict Separation</p><p>Some observers argue that potential benefits of allowing the blending of banking and commerce, at least to a certain degree, could outweigh the potential costs, which separation aims to avoid.</p><p>Economies of scale and scope--provided they do not lead to the exercise of distortionary market power--are considered beneficial in most contexts. They allow enterprises to be more efficient and to reduce costs./29</p><p>Companies may, depending on market characteristics, pass on cost savings to consumers. For example, a commercial company that pays fees to use the payment processing services of a bank may be able to reduce costs by bringing that process in-house. In addition, a combined enterprise might be more resilient to economic or financial downturns because their risks are diversified; they make income from both banking and commerce, not exclusively one or the other./30</p><p>Commercial businesses' relationships with consumers and familiarity with specific market conditions could produce additional benefits. One could be information efficiency (e.g., knowledge about their customers' creditworthiness or needs)./31</p><p>For example, if the above hypothetical kitchen remodeler were instead a contractor who regularly made purchases from the retailer, the retailer-owned bank might consider the contractor to be competent and know that home improvement loans have been performing well. A stand-alone bank with no specialization in home remodeling may not have that information and thus might incorrectly judge the merits of the loan application. Customer convenience could also improve if customers were able to shop for goods and services and receive financing at one location at the same time./32</p><p>In the case where commercial-owned banks could more conveniently provide a customer with lower-cost financing based on better information, these would be benefits that could not be realized in the case of a strict separation of banking and commerce.</p><p>In the context of the ILC debate, opponents to establishing more FDIC-insured ILCs assert that the risks and costs posed by the blending of banking and commerce warrant stricter separation./33</p><p>Meanwhile, ILC proponents assert that ILCs can use the BHCA exception to provide a safe and efficient source of financing to borrowers who might not otherwise have access to the financial services ILCs provide./34</p><p>* * *</p><p>Content omitted: <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46489\">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46489</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Selected Possible Legislative Alternatives</p><p>Given recent developments, Congress may choose to address ILC policy issues across a spectrum of options. If Congress were to determine the current ILC legal and regulatory framework fundamentally allows too much blending of banking and commerce, it could implement more strict separation. Alternatively, if Congress were to find certain aspects of ILC regulation problematic, it could place targeted new requirements and limits on those aspects. Either of these approaches could include grandfathered provisions for existing ILCs. On the other hand, if Congress determines ILCs are beneficial and well-regulated, it could decide to limit the FDIC's apparent ability to delay ILC application decisions. In addition, if Congress were to require more time to consider ILC issues and pending applications, it could reinstate a temporary moratorium on FDIC insurance approvals for ILCs.</p><p>If Congress were to determine ILCs are entirely problematic, one approach it could take would be to make future ILCs ineligible for FDIC insurance. As discussed above, the FDIC guarantee of deposits may raise certain policy concerns involving creating incentives for risk-taking and extending government safety nets to organizations that are commercial enterprises in part.</p><p>Banning new ILCs from eligibility for FDIC insurance would eliminate these concerns, but at the cost of prohibiting certain potential future credit and financial services providers.</p><p>Similar to deposit insurance eligibility, the fact that ILCs are exempt from the definition of a bank under the BHCA is the source of many other concerns related to ILCs and often characterized as a loophole by banks and other ILC critics. Thus, another option for relatively sweeping change would be to amend the BHCA to remove that exemption or to otherwise make the regulatory treatment of ILCs equivalent to banks. In the 116th Congress, S. 2839 takes the latter approach by subjecting ILC holding companies to Federal Reserve supervision and prohibiting commercial firms from becoming ILC holding companies.</p><p>Congress could take the more targeted approach of changing aspects of how ILCs and their parents are regulated. For example, it could place limits on the size of the commercial operation of ILC affiliates or the portion of commercial business making up the organization's business as a whole, instead of prohibiting commercial operations entirely. Such measures could reduce risks associated with enabling large companies from exercising market power. If Congress were to determine that lack of supervision of ILC parents is problematic, it could extend the supervisory authorities of the Federal Reserve or the FDIC to ILC parents and specify certain features of BHC regulations that would and would not apply to those parents. Codifying aspects of the FDIC's recent rulemaking into law would be another possible approach along these lines.</p><p>In the period leading up to the March 2020 approvals, some policymakers had become concerned that the FDIC seemed to be able to indefinitely delay ILCs applications without calling for public comments or initiating the rulemaking process and without a mandate from Congress./110</p><p>Although the FDIC's eventual approval of two ILC applications and its issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking may have lessened these concerns, Congress may nevertheless determine that the FDIC's authorities and requirements related to granting deposit insurance should be amended to address how the agency assesses and processes ILC applications.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 James R.

Here are excerpts of the report issued on Aug. 21 and written by David W. Perkins, specialist in macroeconomic policy:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Summary:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industrial loan companies (ILCs)--financialinstitutions chartered by a small number of states-- operate in almost every way like a commercial bank, including taking deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). In many ways, ILCs are subject to the same laws and regulations as all state banks; however, notable differences betweenthe rules applicable to the parent holding companies ofILCs and those applicable to bank holding companies have made ILCs the subject of long-standing debate. Recent efforts by technology-focused financial services companies (financial technology or \"fintech\" companies) to establish new ILCs have elevated the visibility of ILC policy issues.</p><p>The ILC segment of the FDIC-insured depository industry is relatively small; as of March 31, 2020, 23 ILCs were operating in 5 states. Their combined assets made up less than 1% of all FDIC-insured institutions' combined total assets. This small segment draws attention because ILCs are, provided they meet certain criteria, excluded from the definition of a bank under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA; P.L.84-511). As a result, parent companies that own ILCs are not prohibited from operating industrial or commercial enterprises (i.e., companies producing or selling nonfinancial goods and services) and are not subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve, as are bank holding companies.</p><p>Opponents of the BHCA exemption argue that this exemption allows for a blending of banking and commerce that U.S. policy generally has sought to avoid. In their view, the blending of banking and commerce creates incentives for imprudent underwriting, inappropriately extends government-backed bank safety nets, and increases opportunities for companies to exercise distortionary market power. In addition, opponents argue that lack of Federal Reserve supervision of ILCs results in inadequate regulatory oversight, placing banks and their holding companies at a disadvantage. Proponents argue that ILCs allow for a degree of banking and commerce blending that, on net,is beneficial, allowing organizations to realize economies of scope and information efficiencies, diversify risks, provide customer convenience, and increase the availability of credit and financial services. Proponents also argue that existing FDIC and state-level regulation and supervision are sufficient to mitigate risks.</p><p>Policymakers periodically have addressed ILC-related issues since the 1910s. Early on, states enacted ILC-related laws; these laws were not uniform, and some states permitted ILCs to take deposits. After the FDIC was established in 1933, it granted deposit insurance to ILCs on a case-by-case basis, depending on the state laws applicable to and practices of the individual ILCs. Over time, the differences between banks and ILCs narrowed, leading to calls for FDIC insurance to be more widely available to insure deposits at ILCs. The Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act (P.L. 97-320) explicitly made ILCs eligible for FDIC insurance in 1982, and states began requiring ILCs to be FDIC-insured. The current regulatory framework for ILCs was in large part shaped by the Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA; P.L. 100-86) in 1987, as the law exempted an ILC's parent from the BHCA, thus creating the avenue for commercial enterprises to own an institution that could offer FDIC-insured deposits.</p><p>Efforts by Walmart and The Home Depot to own ILCs in the mid-2000s resulted in widespread objections related to fears that large retailers would exercise anticompetitive market power. These objections led to two official moratoriums on FDIC insurance approvals for ILCs spanning from2006 to 2008 (as implemented by the FDIC) and from 2010 to 2013 (as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act [P.L. 111-203]). The debate has been reignited by recent applications, including one by a large Japanese retailer. In March 2020, the FDIC approved two new ILC applications and issued a proposed rule on ILC applications.</p><p>As these developments unfold, Congress may consider ILC-related issues. If Congress were to decide to restrict ILCs, then making new ILCs ineligible for FDIC insurance, repealing the BHCA exemption, or partially amending aspects of their current regulation could be options with varying degrees of restriction. For example, S. 2839 would subject ILC holding companies to Federal Reserve supervision and prohibit commercial firms from becoming ILC holding companies. Were Congress to decide it does not want to restrict ILCs or hinder their establishment, it could expand ILC access to FDIC insurance, perhaps by placing requirements on the FDIC to grant insurance if certain conditions are met. If Congress wanted to prevent the establishment of new ILCs while it considers the issues at hand, it could implement another moratorium.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Overview of Industrial Loan Companies</p><p>Policy Issues Raised by ILCs</p><p>Separation of Banking and Commerce Policy Debate</p><p>Arguments for Strict Separation</p><p>Arguments Against Strict Separation</p><p>Different Regulatory Treatment Policy Debate</p><p>Policy Issues Regulation</p><p>Before Federal Deposit Insurance: 1910-1933</p><p>Deposit Insurance Based on FDIC Interpretation: 1933-1982</p><p>ILC Eligibility Depending on State: 1982-1987</p><p>Current Regulatory Framework: 1987-Present</p><p>Recent Controversies and Developments</p><p>Controversial Applications and Official Moratoriums: 2005-2013</p><p>Post-Moratorium Limbo: 2013-2019</p><p>Latest Developments</p><p>Nelnet and Square Approved</p><p>FDIC Proposed Rulemaking</p><p>Rakuten Application and Potential of Future Big Tech</p><p>Selected Possible Legislative Alternatives</p><p>* * *</p><p>Introduction</p><p>In recent years, several technology-focused financial service companies (sometimes characterized as financial technology or \"fintech\" companies) have applied to state bank regulators and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to establish an industrial loan company (ILC; also called industrial banks or industrial loan corporations). ILCs are state-chartered institutions that can be, depending on the state, allowed to make loans, process payments, and take deposits insured by the FDIC./1</p><p>In short, ILCs provide bank services. Certain ILC applications--and the FDIC's approval of two ILC applications in March 2020--have reignited a policy debate over whether aspects of ILC regulation contravene long-standing U.S. banking policy.</p><p>ILCs are controversial because under the Banking Holding Company Act (BHCA; P.L. 84-511), they are exempt from the definition of a bank,/2 allowing a degree of blending of a banking enterprise and a commerce enterprise. The BHCA generally subjects companies that own banks to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve and prohibits them from owning nonfinancial enterprises./3</p><p>Because ILCs are exempt from the definition of a bank under the BHCA, ILC parent companies are not subject to the prohibition against commercial ownership or to Federal Reserve supervision.</p><p>Since at least as far back as the Glass-Steagall Act (Sections 20, 21, 26, and 32 of The Banking Act of 1933; P.L. 73-66), Congress generally has sought to separate banking enterprises that take deposits and make loans from commercial enterprises producing and selling goods and services.</p><p>The rationale for this policy is to prevent various potential negative outcomes, including an increased occurrence of imprudent lending backed by government safety nets and an increased likelihood of organizations exercising distortionary market power./4</p><p>On the other hand, those who favor ILCs discount arguments for strict separation of banking and commerce and maintain that these mixed enterprises provide potential benefits--including economies of scope, risk diversification, information efficiencies, and customer convenience--that could exceed the potential costs resulting from the extension of government safety nets and reduced competition./5</p><p>This report examines ILCs and related policy issues. It begins with an overview of ILCs and the current state of the industry. Next, the report examines the policy issues raised by ILCs. It then summarizes the current regulatory framework's development and examines industry and policy developments since 2005. These developments include the FDIC's and Congress's implementation of moratoriums on new ILC approvals and recent developments involving fintech companies. The report concludes with brief descriptions of selected, possible legislative alternatives.</p><p>Overview of Industrial Loan Companies</p><p>ILCs are financial institutions chartered in a small number of states--currently, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, and Utah/6--that are permitted to make a wide array of loan types, offer most types of deposit accounts, and open branches across state lines. Except for a federal law that technically restricts their ability to offer checking accounts (discussed later in this section), they, in effect, act as fullservice banks. As is the case with traditional banks, an ILC may be owned by a parent holding company./7</p><p>In general, the regulation of banks and ILCs, where it relates directly to the insured depository, are similar./8</p><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act; P.L. 81-797) defines \"state bank\" to include ILCs./9</p><p>As with any state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC is the primary federal regulator of ILCs and supervises them along with the chartering state's bank agency. (Currently, there are no ILC members of the Federal Reserve System.) As a result, state bank regulators and the FDIC subject state-chartered banks and ILCs to supervision and regulation, including safety and soundness requirements (e.g., capital standards and restrictions on transactions with insiders), as well as compliance with federal consumer protection, community reinvestment, and anti-money laundering laws./10</p><p>Certain federal laws and regulations that apply to bank holding companies (BHCs) also apply to ILC holding companies: notably, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (P.L. 663-43) prohibiting or restricting certain transactions between banks and their affiliates./11</p><p>In addition, under Section 38A of the FDI Act, as amended by Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank; P.L. 111-203), the FDIC must require the parent company of an ILC to \"serve as a source of financial strength\" for the depository ILC./12</p><p>These similarities aside, the regulation of the parent holding companies of banks and ILCs differ in a significant way. Under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA; P.L.84-511), a parent company that owns a bank, as defined in that act, is designated as a BHC./13</p><p>BHCs are generally prohibited from owning nonfinancial enterprises/14 and are subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve./15</p><p>ILCs that meet certain criteria are exempt from the BHCA definition of a bank./16</p><p>Thus, parent companies that own an ILC are not designated as BHCs and are not subject to prohibitions against commercial activity or to the Federal Reserve's direct supervision./17</p><p>To qualify for the BHCA exemption, ILCs cannot offer demand deposits(i.e., checking accounts or other deposits that the depository institution generally must make available to the depositor for withdrawal within less than seven days' notice)./18</p><p>Instead, ILCs generally offer negotiable order of withdraw (NOW) accounts. NOW accounts are not considered demand deposits because the depository reserves the right to require seven days' notice or more to transfer the funds./19</p><p>In practice, ILCs may choose to make funds available upon request and not avail themselves of the allowable seven days. Thus, a NOW account functions as a checking account from the perspective of an ILC customer, although it is not technically a demand deposit account./20</p><p>As of the end of the first quarter of 2020, there were 23 FDIC-insured ILCs chartered in 5 states, 14 of which were chartered in Utah./21</p><p>As shown in Table 1, these ILCs collectively held almost $165 billion in assets and $135 billion in deposits; both amounts are less than 1% of the total amount held by all insured depositories./22</p><p>Some of these ILCs are owned by parent companies that are primarily involved in finance, including large organizations like UBS (a non-U.S. bank) and Sallie Mae (a student loan company). Nonfinancial commercial companies, including Toyota and BMW, own others. Some ILCs are small, niche lenders. For example, Medallion Bank specializes in loans for taxi cab \"medallions\"--licenses to operate taxis issued by large cities-- and EnerBank is owned by a home construction company and makes construction loans.</p><p>Currently, the ILC industry is relatively smaller than it has been at other times in recent history, although it has always been smaller compared with the overall depository industry. For example, there were 54 FDIC-insured ILCs with nearly $264 billion in assets in 2007./23</p><p>The industry shrunk following the 2007-2009 financial crisis for numerous reasons. Companies such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and General Motors converted their ILCs to commercial banks during the crisis and became BHCs. Other ILCs voluntarily closed, including those owned by GE and Target, and two small ILCs failed./24</p><p>However, there are recent indications that there may be a resurgence of interest in establishing ILCs, including among technology-focused companies (as discussed in the \"Latest Developments\" section, below).</p><p>Table 1. Industrial Loan Company (ILC) Number,Assets, and Deposits, by State</p><p>Table can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46489\">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46489</url></p><p>Policy Issues Raised by ILCs</p><p>ILC debates primarily involve two policy issues. One is related to the general separation of banking and commerce. ILC opponents often argue that the ownership of deposit-taking ILCs by commercial enterprises allows too much blending of activities and too many associated risks.</p><p>Proponents often argue that there are important benefits of ILCs as operated under current laws and regulations, and that ILCs as financial services providers are appropriately regulated. The other issue is the related question of whether parent companies that own ILCs should be subject to Federal Reserve supervision, as BHCs are. This section examines these policy issues.</p><p>Separation of Banking and Commerce Policy Debate</p><p>Historically, the United States has adopted policies that separate banking enterprises from commercial enterprises. These policies serve to prevent various interrelated outcomes, described below.</p><p>Arguments for Strict Separation</p><p>One potential issue with mixing banking and commerce within a single organization is that the bank subsidiary could have incentives to make decisions based on the interests of the larger organization, instead of on safe and sound banking principles./25</p><p>For example, a consumer who wishes to remodel his kitchen may need to take out a loan to buy appliances and fixtures from a retail company. If the consumer were to apply for the loan at a stand-alone bank, whether or not the bank would make the loan and under what terms depends largely on the applicant's ability to repay. If the consumer were to apply for a loan at a bank owned by the retailer, the retailer would make an immediate profit on the sale of the goods, and the retailer-owned bank would later make profit on the loan repayment. Thus, the retailer-owned bank would have incentive to make loans to riskier borrowers and at lower interest rates compared with the stand-alone bank. This logic would apply to any scenario in which a bank owned by a commercial parent receives loan applications from the parent's customers and suppliers.</p><p>A retailer or other commercial enterprise making a loan may not be considered problematic per se. Whether a company can make profit by lending to its customers or suppliers is a matter of market forces and does not necessarily raise policy concerns--even if the loans are riskier and default at a higher rate. Concerns arise when the enterprise is allowed to raise funding by accepting government-backed deposits. Protecting depositories from possible negative effects of risk-taking--and thus introducing what is known as moral hazard--removes certain market incentives that constrain risk-taking (see the \"Deposit Insurance Based on FDIC Interpretation: 1933-1982\" section, below). One main rationale for extending government guarantees to banks is that bank failures are especially harmful economically and socially, as they expose individuals seeking to keep their money safe--as opposed to investing for returns--to losses. In contrast, commercial enterprises generally are not given government support because their failures are seen as less disruptive and impose losses on return-seeking, risk-accepting investors./26</p><p>For these reasons, proponents of separating banking and commerce argue that separation prevents an inappropriate extension of bank safety nets to commercial enterprises. 27</p><p>Another potential issue with combined banking and commerce enterprises is that their in-house bank operations could increase opportunities for the enterprises to achieve the size and financial resources necessary to exercise anticompetitive market power./28</p><p>Returning to the comparison between the stand-alone bank and a retailer-owned bank, if the retailer-owned bank were able to make loans at a lower interest rate, then it could be difficult for the stand-alone bank to compete.</p><p>Similarly, a retailer that does not own a bank and fund loans to customers with governmentbacked deposits may have difficulty competing with a retailer that does. Where blending is allowed, these economies of scale and scope may naturally lead to large conglomerates with the ability to exercise market power, potentially stifling competition and charging consumers prices higher than free market prices.</p><p>Arguments Against Strict Separation</p><p>Some observers argue that potential benefits of allowing the blending of banking and commerce, at least to a certain degree, could outweigh the potential costs, which separation aims to avoid.</p><p>Economies of scale and scope--provided they do not lead to the exercise of distortionary market power--are considered beneficial in most contexts. They allow enterprises to be more efficient and to reduce costs./29</p><p>Companies may, depending on market characteristics, pass on cost savings to consumers. For example, a commercial company that pays fees to use the payment processing services of a bank may be able to reduce costs by bringing that process in-house. In addition, a combined enterprise might be more resilient to economic or financial downturns because their risks are diversified; they make income from both banking and commerce, not exclusively one or the other./30</p><p>Commercial businesses' relationships with consumers and familiarity with specific market conditions could produce additional benefits. One could be information efficiency (e.g., knowledge about their customers' creditworthiness or needs)./31</p><p>For example, if the above hypothetical kitchen remodeler were instead a contractor who regularly made purchases from the retailer, the retailer-owned bank might consider the contractor to be competent and know that home improvement loans have been performing well. A stand-alone bank with no specialization in home remodeling may not have that information and thus might incorrectly judge the merits of the loan application. Customer convenience could also improve if customers were able to shop for goods and services and receive financing at one location at the same time./32</p><p>In the case where commercial-owned banks could more conveniently provide a customer with lower-cost financing based on better information, these would be benefits that could not be realized in the case of a strict separation of banking and commerce.</p><p>In the context of the ILC debate, opponents to establishing more FDIC-insured ILCs assert that the risks and costs posed by the blending of banking and commerce warrant stricter separation./33</p><p>Meanwhile, ILC proponents assert that ILCs can use the BHCA exception to provide a safe and efficient source of financing to borrowers who might not otherwise have access to the financial services ILCs provide./34</p><p>Different Regulatory Treatment Policy Debate</p><p>U.S. depository institutions operate under charters offered at the federal and state levels and in various forms, each of which is subject to different regulatory approaches. While these differences have generally narrowed over time, certain differences remain. One of the rationales for a multiple charter system is that it provides the opportunity for institutions with different business models and ownership arrangements to choose a regulatory regime appropriately suited to their business needs and risks. Under this system, multiple institution types are available to meet market needs./35</p><p>This fragmented regulatory framework also can create challenges. One challenge is that, in some circumstances, institutions engaged in similar businesses may be subject to different regulations./36</p><p>Relatedly, this system may create avenues for institutions to actively seek out charters and ways to structure themselves, largely to side-step certain regulations./37</p><p>The balance policymakers often aim to strike is to have enough differentiation between charters and regulatory regimes to provide for appropriate tailoring, while not inadvertently creating regulatory gaps that could allow excessive risk to enter the banking system and economy. Opponents of ILCs argue that the exemption from Federal Reserve regulation and supervision is an example of a problematic loophole that creates a regulatory \"blind spot.\"/38</p><p>For example, BHCs</p><p>are subject to capital ratio requirements and examination by the Federal Reserve; ILC parents are not. ILC proponents argue that current FDIC and state regulation and supervision of ILCs are sufficient./39</p><p>For example, Section 616 of Dodd-Frank added Section 38A to the FDI Act, requiring federal parent regulators to ensure that all federally-regulated depository parents are sources of financial strength for subsidiary depositories. The FDIC has used this authority and others to require ILC parents to enter into agreements consenting to examination by the FDIC./40</p><p>Selected Possible Legislative Alternatives</p><p>Given recent developments, Congress may choose to address ILC policy issues across a spectrum of options. If Congress were to determine the current ILC legal and regulatory framework fundamentally allows too much blending of banking and commerce, it could implement more strict separation. Alternatively, if Congress were to find certain aspects of ILC regulation problematic, it could place targeted new requirements and limits on those aspects. Either of these approaches could include grandfathered provisions for existing ILCs. On the other hand, if Congress determines ILCs are beneficial and well-regulated, it could decide to limit the FDIC's apparent ability to delay ILC application decisions. In addition, if Congress were to require more time to consider ILC issues and pending applications, it could reinstate a temporary moratorium on FDIC insurance approvals for ILCs.</p><p>If Congress were to determine ILCs are entirely problematic, one approach it could take would be to make future ILCs ineligible for FDIC insurance. As discussed above, the FDIC guarantee of deposits may raise certain policy concerns involving creating incentives for risk-taking and extending government safety nets to organizations that are commercial enterprises in part.</p><p>Banning new ILCs from eligibility for FDIC insurance would eliminate these concerns, but at the cost of prohibiting certain potential future credit and financial services providers.</p><p>Similar to deposit insurance eligibility, the fact that ILCs are exempt from the definition of a bank under the BHCA is the source of many other concerns related to ILCs and often characterized as a loophole by banks and other ILC critics. Thus, another option for relatively sweeping change would be to amend the BHCA to remove that exemption or to otherwise make the regulatory treatment of ILCs equivalent to banks. In the 116th Congress, S. 2839 takes the latter approach by subjecting ILC holding companies to Federal Reserve supervision and prohibiting commercial firms from becoming ILC holding companies.</p><p>Congress could take the more targeted approach of changing aspects of how ILCs and their parents are regulated. For example, it could place limits on the size of the commercial operation of ILC affiliates or the portion of commercial business making up the organization's business as a whole, instead of prohibiting commercial operations entirely. Such measures could reduce risks associated with enabling large companies from exercising market power. If Congress were to determine that lack of supervision of ILC parents is problematic, it could extend the supervisory authorities of the Federal Reserve or the FDIC to ILC parents and specify certain features of BHC regulations that would and would not apply to those parents. Codifying aspects of the FDIC's recent rulemaking into law would be another possible approach along these lines.</p><p>In the period leading up to the March 2020 approvals, some policymakers had become concerned that the FDIC seemed to be able to indefinitely delay ILCs applications without calling for public comments or initiating the rulemaking process and without a mandate from Congress./108</p><p>Although the FDIC's eventual approval of two ILC applications and its issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking may have lessened these concerns, Congress may nevertheless determine that the FDIC's authorities and requirements related to granting deposit insurance should be amended to address how the agency assesses and processes ILC applications.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 James R.

Here are excerpts of the report issued on Sept. 25 and written by Patricia Moloney Figliola, specialist in internet and telecommunications policy:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TikTok is a globally popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked to by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.</p><p>TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its \"addictive\" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a \"recommendation engine\" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices.</p><p>According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored--and could be shared.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from \"transacting\" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.</p><p>On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to \"serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider\" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.</p><p>It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.</p><p>On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into \"the crosshairs of a global technology battle\" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called \"techno-nationalism,\" refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).</p><p>Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents:</p><p>Background ... 1</p><p>What Is TikTok? ... 1</p><p>* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2</p><p>* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3</p><p>- Data Collection ... 3</p><p>- Data Storage ... 4</p><p>- Data Sharing ... 4</p><p>White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4</p><p>* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5</p><p>* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5</p><p>- ByteDance Reaction to Divestiture Requirement ... 5</p><p>China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6</p><p>Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 6</p><p>Discussion ... 8</p><p>* Threat to Security ... 8</p><p>* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 8</p><p>Related Congressional Activity ... 10</p><p>* Hearings ... 10</p><p>* Legislation ... 10</p><p>Conclusion ... 11</p><p>Tables:</p><p>Table 1. \"For You\" Feed Factors and Elements ... 2</p><p>Appendixes:</p><p>Appendix.

The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2</p><p>Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.</p><p>WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3</p><p>While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.</p><p>What Is TikTok?</p><p>On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musically app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4</p><p>In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15 second segments./6</p><p>Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform.</p><p>ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7</p><p>The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means \"Headlines.\" Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).</p><p>TikTok's Recommendation Engine</p><p>TikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its \"addictive\" video feed, For You./8</p><p>The app builds this feed through a \"recommendation engine\" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, \"How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou.\"/9</p><p>The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos \"liked,\" shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using.

A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.</p><p>The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10</p><p>Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok Critics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12</p><p>Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13</p><p>Data Collection</p><p>According to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.</p><p>The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos \"liked,\" shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15</p><p>The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16</p><p>Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18</p><p>On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow \"the app to track users online,\" and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19</p><p>Data Storage</p><p>TikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:</p><p>The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21</p><p>Data Sharing</p><p>Despite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22</p><p>Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23</p><p>* * *</p><p>Content omitted: <url normalizedValue=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543\">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46543</url></p><p>* * *</p><p>Related Congressional Activity</p><p>Congress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./56</p><p>Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/57 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.</p><p>Hearings</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:</p><p>* \"How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors\" was held on November 5, 2019./58</p><p>* \"Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing\" was held on March 4, 2020./59 TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./60</p><p>Legislation</p><p>Three bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:</p><p>* S. 4452/61 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.</p><p>* S. 3455,/62 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250.)/63</p><p>* H.R. 6896,/64 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 President Donald J.

It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked to by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its \"addictive\" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a \"recommendation engine\" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices.</p><p>According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored--and could be shared.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from \"transacting\" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.</p><p>On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to \"serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider\" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.</p><p>It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.</p><p>On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling does not affect the November 12, 2020, deadline that ByteDance divest from TikTok in the United States.</p><p>Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into \"the crosshairs of a global technology battle\" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called \"techno-nationalism,\" refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).</p><p>Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents:</p><p>Background ... 1</p><p>What Is TikTok? ... 1</p><p>* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2</p><p>* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3</p><p>- Data Collection ... 3</p><p>- Data Storage ... 4</p><p>- Data Sharing ... 4</p><p>White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4</p><p>* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5</p><p>* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5</p><p>- ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to Divest ... 5</p><p>China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6</p><p>Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 6</p><p>Discussion ... 8</p><p>* Threat to Security ... 8</p><p>* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 9</p><p>Related Congressional Activity ... 10</p><p>* Hearings ... 10</p><p>* Legislation ... 10</p><p>Conclusion ... 11</p><p>Tables:</p><p>Table 1. \"For You\" Feed Factors and Elements ... 2</p><p>Appendixes:</p><p>Appendix.

The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2</p><p>Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.</p><p>WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3</p><p>While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.</p><p>What Is TikTok?</p><p>On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musical.ly app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musical.ly had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4</p><p>In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15second segments./6</p><p>Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform. ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7</p><p>The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means \"Headlines.\" Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).</p><p>TikTok's Recommendation Engine</p><p>TikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its \"addictive\" video feed, For You./8</p><p>The app builds this feed through a \"recommendation engine\" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, \"How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou.\"/9</p><p>The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos \"liked,\" shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.</p><p>Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.</p><p>Table 1. \"For You\" Feed Factors and Elements</p><p>Table omitted.</p><p>According to TikTok, [a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.</p><p>The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10</p><p>Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok Critics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12</p><p>Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13</p><p>Data Collection</p><p>According to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.</p><p>The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos \"liked,\" shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15</p><p>The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16</p><p>Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18</p><p>On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow \"the app to track users online,\" and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19</p><p>Data Storage</p><p>TikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:</p><p>The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21</p><p>Data Sharing</p><p>Despite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22</p><p>Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23</p><p>* * *</p><p>White House TikTok Executive Orders</p><p>President Trump has issued two Executive Orders affecting the future of TikTok in the United States, one on August 6, 2020, and another on August 14, 2020.</p><p>Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance</p><p>The August 6, 2020, TikTok Executive Order was set to take effect on September 20, 2020, but that date has been extended to September 27, 2020. Once in effect, it will prohibit any U.S. company or person from transacting with ByteDance. The order does not state which specific transactions are to be prohibited, but it likely means, at least, the TikTok app will no longer appear on Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store in the United States. It might also make it illegal for U.S. companies to purchase advertising on TikTok. Some U.S. TikTok employees have speculated that they would no longer be able to be paid.</p><p>Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok</p><p>On August 14, 2020, President Trump issued an additional Executive Order, \"Regarding the Acquisition of Musical.ly by ByteDance Ltd.,\"/24 that imposed additional conditions on the ability of ByteDance to operate TikTok in the United States. The order requires ByteDance and its \"subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders\" to divest from \"any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States\" as determined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)./25</p><p>The order also requires ByteDance to destroy all data obtained or derived from either the TikTok or Music.ly apps from U.S. users upon divestiture and certify in writing to CFIUS that it has done so. The order requires these actions within 90 days, rather than the 45 days included in the first order, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer./26</p><p>A transfer of ownership and operation of TikTok to a U.S. entity not subject to Chinese laws, including management of collected user data, appears designed to limit the ability of the Chinese government to acquire access to future U.S. user data.</p><p>ByteDance Lawsuit Against Order to Divest</p><p>ByteDance opposed divestiture from TikTok and, on August 24, 2020, sued the Trump Administration./27</p><p>In a blog post, TikTok stated that it was \"shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process.\"/28</p><p>On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. He stated that while President Trump has broad authority to prohibit business transactions with foreign entities that are deemed to pose a national security risk, TikTok appears to be exempt from such a prohibition because it is a personal communication service, which is protected by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The ruling does not affect the November 12, 2020, deadline that ByteDance divest from TikTok in the United States./29</p><p>* * *</p><p>China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules</p><p>The Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China was passed in November 2016 and went into effect in June 2017. It was updated in November 2018 by the Regulations on Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs. These laws--</p><p>* strictly control online activities;</p><p>* mandate the local storage of user data and the registration of certain network assets; and</p><p>* allow the government to conduct onsite and remote inspection of computer networks./30</p><p>The law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with government intelligence operations if so requested/31 and may allow the Chinese government access to user data collected by any company doing business in China. One analyst notes that \"by demanding access to any data collected and stored in China, the updated regulations force [domestic and] foreign companies based in China to comply with its investigative measures, leaving intellectual property and private information vulnerable to government abuse.\"/32</p><p>On August 31, 2020, China took specific action that could prohibit the sale of TikTok's underlying technology and processes. The new export regulations cover such technologies as \"text analysis, content recommendation, speech modeling, and voice recognition.\"/33</p><p>Since the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine is considered the key element of TikTok's success, a ban on transferring the technology and processes used to create it could make it more difficult to sell the app or prevent a sale altogether./34</p><p>Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok</p><p>In response to the TikTok Executive Order, two leading bidders emerged as potential buyers of the app: Oracle and a partnership between Microsoft and Walmart. Bids were reported to be in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion./35</p><p>Twitter and Google were also rumored to be interested in acquiring the app./36</p><p>On September 13, 2020, Microsoft announced that its bid had been rejected by ByteDance. In its announcement, the company stated, \"We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.\" One expert, Alex Stamos, Director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, commented that this statement is \"an attempt to poison the well against an Oracle deal where they only take over hosting. And [Microsoft] is right to do so.\"/37</p><p>On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to \"serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider\" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal./38</p><p>From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership rather than a sale, with TikTok using Oracle's cloud hosting services./39 This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance. Secretary Mnuchin said that CFIUS will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.</p><p>On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would join its bid for TikTok, with the two companies acquiring 20% of a newly formed company, TikTok Global,/40 with the remaining 80% owned by ByteDance. According to announcements made by the companies, 40% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, which is meant to indicate that the new company would be under majority U.S. ownership./41</p><p>However, this arrangement, along with TikTok keeping the For You recommendation engine algorithm,/42 would not appear to satisfy conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. In addition to U.S. approval of the proposal being uncertain given its provisions, Chinese approval of the proposal is also uncertain. China's new export regulations appear to forbid transfer of the For You algorithm, but the United States appears to require such a transfer. So, the legal requirements of each country are at odds with each other.</p><p>On September 23, 2020, TikTok filed for an injunction in federal court to stop a ban on the app that is set to take effect on September 27, 2020.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Some believe TikTok and other apps developed and owned by Chinese companies pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are governed by China's Cybersecurity Law. Others believe that TikTok is caught up in increasing trade tensions between China and the United States./43</p><p>Threat to Security</p><p>Although TikTok forcefully states that it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, many security and privacy advocates are skeptical. For example, in addition to the lawsuit cited above (see \"Data Sharing\"), the American Civil Liberties Union argues that \"Chinese apps in particular have a reputation for grabbing more data than required to provide their services, often sending information to advertising networks ... [they] are frequently far more abusive than others....\"/44</p><p>The Chinese government obtains data about and created by its own citizens, for purposes that range from censorship to mass surveillance./45</p><p>Other countries have also taken action against TikTok on the grounds of security. India banned TikTok and 50 other Chinese apps in June 2020, calling them a \"threat to sovereignty and integrity.\"/46</p><p>Also in June 2020, the European Union opened an investigation into TikTok to examine possible violations of its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)./47</p><p>Australia had threatened to ban the app, but on August 4, 2020, the country's Prime Minister indicated that TikTok would not be banned; however, he warned Australians against the app, saying it \"connects right back to China.\"/48</p><p>Japan, Turkey, and Pakistan have also taken various measures to protect their countries' users from possibly security risks./49</p><p>Technology Trade Protectionism</p><p>Other observers argue that TikTok is caught in \"the crosshairs of a global technology battle,\"/50 and that a unilateral U.S. ban on any app may be comparable to China's \"Great Firewall.\"/51</p><p>One way to potentially understand U.S. and Chinese government actions in this dispute may be through the concept of techno-nationalism,/52 which refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology. Within this framework, technology is considered a central pillar of a country's wellbeing:</p><p>Techno-nationalism ... links technological innovation and capabilities directly to a nation's national security, economic prosperity, and social stability.... [It] seeks to attain competitive advantage for its stakeholders, both locally and globally, and leverage these advantages for geopolitical gain./53</p><p>One policy mechanism that nations use to protect what they view as important or sensitive technologies are export controls, rules which limit to which foreign entities and under what circumstances or conditions specific technologies may be sold or licensed./54</p><p>For example, in August 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce announced sanctions that restrict foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips developed or produced using U.S. software or technology to Huawei, another Chinese company, without first obtaining a license to do so./55</p><p>This restriction has been called a \"lethal blow\"/56 to the company.</p><p>Another mechanism is the use of protectionist practices that privilege domestic entities' access to domestic markets. For example, China requires U.S. telecommunications companies to enter into a partnership with a Chinese company to provide services in that country. In June 2020, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report, \"Threats to US Networks: Oversight of Chinese Government Owned Carriers.\" The report notes that while China has access to the U.S. telecommunications market, U.S. companies do not have that same level of access in China.</p><p>China does not provide US telecommunications companies reciprocal access to the Chinese market and requires foreign carriers seeking to operate in China to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies. These joint ventures often require U.S. companies to give their technology, proprietary know-how, and intellectual property to their Chinese partners.</p><p>Since China was allowed to join the World Trade Organization in 2001, the report notes that \"not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture\" to provide basic telecommunications services in China.\"</p><p>Related Congressional Activity</p><p>Congress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./57</p><p>Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/58 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.</p><p>Hearings</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:</p><p>* \"How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors\" was held on November 5, 2019./59</p><p>* \"Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing\" was held on March 4, 2020./60 TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./61</p><p>Legislation</p><p>Three bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:</p><p>* S. 4452/62 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day</p><p>* S. 3455,/63 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./64)</p><p>* H.R. 6896,/65 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies.

It is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. citizens. This is because ByteDance, like all technology companies doing business in China, is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in the country to turn over user data when asked to by the government. Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TikTok launched in the United States in August 2018. The app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages and has approximately 800 million monthly active users. In the United States, the app has approximately 49 million monthly active users. TikTok's appeal lies heavily on what has been called its \"addictive\" video feed, For You. The app builds this feed through a \"recommendation engine\" algorithm built on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices.</p><p>According to the company, the recommendation engine relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content, including hashtags and videos watched previously, as well as the kind of device a person is using. TikTok critics cite problems with how much data TikTok collects from and about its users and with how that data is stored--and could be shared.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at stopping TikTok from doing business in the United States. Once in effect on September 27, 2020 (an extension from the original date of September 20), the order will prohibit any U.S. company or person from \"transacting\" with ByteDance. On August 14, 2020, the President issued a second Executive Order stating that ByteDance, its subsidiaries, and partners must divest from all assets that support TikTok's operations in the United States and destroy all previously collected U.S. user data. Divestiture may be accomplished by finding a U.S. buyer for TikTok. The requirements are designed to limit the Chinese government's access to current and future data from U.S. TikTok users. ByteDance does not want to divest from TikTok and has sued the Trump Administration.</p><p>On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order. On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to \"serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider\" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal. From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership between the two companies rather than a sale. This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance.</p><p>It is unclear if this deal satisfies the conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. Secretary Mnuchin said that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.</p><p>On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would be joining the TikTok acquisition. Some believe TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are subject to China's laws that require compliance with government requests for data. Others believe that TikTok has fallen into \"the crosshairs of a global technology battle\" based on technology trade protectionism (this concept, also called \"techno-nationalism,\" refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology).</p><p>Similar situations may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Options that Congress may consider include (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) developing a uniform, transparent process to assess and mediate risks posed by foreign apps.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Contents:</p><p>Background ... 1</p><p>What Is TikTok? ... 1</p><p>* TikTok's Recommendation Engine ... 2</p><p>* Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok ... 3</p><p>- Data Collection ... 3</p><p>- Data Storage ... 4</p><p>- Data Sharing ... 4</p><p>White House TikTok Executive Orders ... 4</p><p>* Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance ... 5</p><p>* Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok ... 5</p><p>- ByteDance Reaction to Divestiture Requirement ... 5</p><p>China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules ... 6</p><p>Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok ... 6</p><p>Discussion ... 8</p><p>* Threat to Security ... 8</p><p>* Technology Trade Protectionism ... 8</p><p>Related Congressional Activity ... 10</p><p>* Hearings ... 10</p><p>* Legislation ... 10</p><p>Conclusion ... 11</p><p>Tables:</p><p>Table 1. \"For You\" Feed Factors and Elements ... 2</p><p>Appendixes</p><p>Appendix. What Is WeChat? ... 12</p><p>Contacts:</p><p>Author Information ... 12</p><p>* * *</p><p>Background</p><p>TikTok is a popular video-sharing smartphone application (app) owned by ByteDance Ltd., a privately held company headquartered in Beijing, China. The app is under intense scrutiny by the U.S. government as a potential privacy and security risk to U.S. users. A major concern is that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require companies operating in China to turn over user data when asked to by the national government. On August 6 and August 14, 2020, President Trump signed Executive Orders aimed at stopping U.S. persons and entities from doing business with ByteDance/1 and requiring ByteDance to divest from any holding used to support the operation of TikTok in the United States./2</p><p>Researchers differ over how TikTok's collection of user data compares with other social media apps and whether TikTok poses a unique threat to the privacy and security of its U.S. users, including many minors.</p><p>WeChat, another Chinese-owned app, is often mentioned in conjunction with TikTok, but the two apps are quite different. TikTok has a single function--short video--while WeChat has multiple--voice and data messaging, social media, and digital payment. WeChat is used in the United States primarily by the Chinese language community, whereas TikTok is used more widely. On the same day as the TikTok order, President Trump also signed an Executive Order prohibiting any U.S. individual or entity from engaging in any transaction related to WeChat and its owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd./3</p><p>While issues with the two apps are often conflated, their functions, technical capabilities, and the data collected from their users are different. Only TikTok is discussed in this report. Background information about WeChat is in Appendix.</p><p>* * *</p><p>What Is TikTok?</p><p>On August 2, 2018, U.S. users of the Musically app, a short video service headquartered in Shanghai, China, with a U.S. office in Santa Monica, CA, found that it had been merged into TikTok. Musically had been acquired by ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, in November 2017 for $1 billion as a means to enter the U.S. market. The TikTok app is available in over 155 countries in 39 languages, and has approximately 800 million monthly active users./4</p><p>In the United States, TikTok has approximately 49 million monthly active users/5 and the company maintains offices in Los Angeles and New York. When ByteDance first released the TikTok app in September 2016, videos could be no longer than 15 seconds, but now users are allowed to link together four 15-second segments./6</p><p>Longer videos recorded outside the app can also be uploaded to the platform.</p><p>ByteDance is currently estimated to be worth over $100 billion./7</p><p>The company's core product in China is Toutiao, which means \"Headlines.\" Toutiao began as a mobile news recommendation engine, but has evolved into a platform to deliver content and targeted advertising in other formats as well (e.g., text messages, images, question-and-answer posts, microblogs, videos).</p><p>TikTok's Recommendation Engine</p><p>TikTok's appeal relies on what has been called its \"addictive\" video feed, For You./8</p><p>The app builds this feed through a \"recommendation engine\" using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and data mining practices. How each user's feed is constructed had been a tightly held secret until recently. On June 18, 2020, TikTok published a blog post, \"How TikTok Recommends Videos #ForYou.\"/9</p><p>The company says its algorithm relies on a complex set of weighted factors to recommend content based on user preferences, including hashtags and videos watched; videos \"liked,\" shared, and commented on; as well as the kind of device a person is using. Each user's feed is unique.</p><p>Table 1 lists the specific factors the company says it uses.</p><p>Table 1. \"For You\" Feed Factors and Elements</p><p>Table Omitted.</p><p>According to TikTok, [a]ll these factors are processed by our recommendation system and weighted based on their value to a user. A strong indicator of interest, such as whether a user finishes watching a longer video from beginning to end, would receive greater weight than a weak indicator, such as whether the video's viewer and creator are both in the same country. Videos are then ranked to determine the likelihood of a user's interest in a piece of content, and delivered to each unique For You feed.</p><p>The blog post was seen by most as an effort to provide more transparency to the public as the U.S. government was increasing its scrutiny of the company's practices./10</p><p>Data Collection, Storage, and Sharing by TikTok Critics, as well as some members of Congress, cite as problematic the amount of data that TikTok collects from and about its users, how that data is stored, and how it could potentially be shared with the Chinese government and used in influence campaigns/11 or against U.S. citizens./12</p><p>Based on these concerns, both the Democratic and Republican national committees, the Department of Defense, and some private firms, such as Wells Fargo Inc., have banned or discouraged the use of the TikTok app./13</p><p>Data Collection</p><p>According to its privacy policy,/14 TikTok collects a range of user information, including location data and internet address, keystroke patterns, and the type of device being used to access the app.</p><p>The app also collects and stores a user's browsing and search history within the app, as well as the content of any messages exchanged using the app. Additional information can be collected based on user permission: phone number, phone book, and social-network contacts; GPS data; user age; user-generated content (e.g., photos and videos); store payment information; and the videos \"liked,\" shared, watched all the way through, and re-watched. TikTok states that the app collects less personal data than many other apps, such as Facebook and Google, both of which track user activity across devices (TikTok claims that it does not)./15</p><p>The data that TikTok collects from users appears in many regards to be comparable to what other social media companies gather and use./16</p><p>Some critics have described TikTok's approach to data mining as aggressive/17 and that its ability to track user behavior while using the app, as well as access to a user's photos, videos, and phone book and geolocation tracking (based on user permissions), means that it can build extremely detailed behavioral profiles of its users that could potentially be shared with the Chinese government./18</p><p>On August 11, 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok avoided privacy safeguards in Google's Android operating system to collect users' mobile device MAC addresses, unique identifiers that allow \"the app to track users online,\" and concealed this activity with an additional layer of encryption before ending the practice after 15 months in November 2019./19</p><p>Data Storage</p><p>TikTok claims to store all content created by U.S. users--as well as data about those users--only on servers located within the United States and backed up in Singapore. Those servers are owned or controlled by TikTok, but the company denies that it shares or would share this data with the Chinese government,/20 stating that:</p><p>The key personnel responsible for TikTok ... are all Americans based in the United States--and therefore are not subject to Chinese law. U.S. content moderation is likewise led by a U.S.-based team and operates independently from China, and, as noted above, the TikTok application stores U.S. user data on servers located in the United States and Singapore./21</p><p>Data Sharing</p><p>Despite these assertions, TikTok's website says that information can be shared with its parent company in China or other affiliates (usually advertisers), which operate under Chinese law./22</p><p>Further, a lawsuit filed in federal court in December 2019 asserted that user data was harvested and sent to servers in China./23</p><p>* * *</p><p>White House TikTok Executive Orders</p><p>President Trump has issued two Executive Orders affecting the future of TikTok in the United States, one on August 6, 2020, and another on August 14, 2020.</p><p>Prohibiting Transactions with ByteDance</p><p>The August 6, 2020, TikTok Executive Order was set to take effect on September 20, 2020, but that date has been extended to September 27, 2020. Once in effect, it will prohibit any U.S. company or person from transacting with ByteDance. The order does not state which specific transactions are to be prohibited, but it likely means, at least, the TikTok app will no longer appear on Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store in the United States. It might also make it illegal for U.S. companies to purchase advertising on TikTok. Some U.S. TikTok employees have speculated that they would no longer be able to be paid.</p><p>Requiring Divestiture of ByteDance from TikTok</p><p>On August 14, 2020, President Trump issued an additional Executive Order, \"Regarding the Acquisition of Musically by ByteDance Ltd.,\"/24 that imposed additional conditions on the ability of ByteDance to operate TikTok in the United States. The order requires ByteDance and its \"subsidiaries, affiliates, and Chinese shareholders\" to divest from \"any tangible or intangible assets or property, wherever located, used to enable or support ByteDance's operation of the TikTok application in the United States\" as determined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)./25</p><p>The order also requires ByteDance to destroy all data obtained or derived from either the TikTok or Musically apps from U.S. users upon divestiture and certify in writing to CFIUS that it has done so. The order requires these actions within 90 days, rather than the 45 days included in the first order, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer./26</p><p>A transfer of ownership and operation of TikTok to a U.S. entity not subject to Chinese laws, including management of collected user data, appears designed to limit the ability of the Chinese government to acquire access to future U.S. user data.</p><p>ByteDance Reaction to Divestiture Requirement</p><p>ByteDance opposed divestiture from TikTok and, on August 24, 2020, sued the Trump Administration./27</p><p>In a blog post, TikTok stated that it was \"shocked by the recent Executive Order, which was issued without any due process.\"/28</p><p>On September 27, 2020, Judge Carl J. Nichols of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration order.</p><p>* * *</p><p>China's Cybersecurity Law and Export Rules</p><p>The Cybersecurity Law of the People's Republic of China was passed in November 2016 and went into effect in June 2017. It was updated in November 2018 by the Regulations on Internet Security Supervision and Inspection by Public Security Organs. These laws--</p><p>* strictly control online activities;</p><p>* mandate the local storage of user data and the registration of certain network assets; and</p><p>* allow the government to conduct onsite and remote inspection of computer networks./29</p><p>The law requires Chinese companies to cooperate with government intelligence operations if so requested/30 and may allow the Chinese government access to user data collected by any company doing business in China. One analyst notes that \"by demanding access to any data collected and stored in China, the updated regulations force [domestic and] foreign companies based in China to comply with its investigative measures, leaving intellectual property and private information vulnerable to government abuse.\"/31</p><p>On August 31, 2020, China took specific action that could prohibit the sale of TikTok's underlying technology and processes. The new export regulations cover such technologies as \"text analysis, content recommendation, speech modeling, and voice recognition.\"/32</p><p>Since the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine is considered the key element of TikTok's success, a ban on transferring the technology and processes used to create it could make it more difficult to sell the app or prevent a sale altogether./33</p><p>* * *</p><p>Status of Potential Oracle and Walmart Partnership with TikTok</p><p>In response to the TikTok Executive Order, two leading bidders emerged as potential buyers of the app: Oracle and a partnership between Microsoft and Walmart. Bids were reported to be in the range of $20 billion to $30 billion./34</p><p>Twitter and Google were also rumored to be interested in acquiring the app./35</p><p>On September 13, 2020, Microsoft announced that its bid had been rejected by ByteDance. In its announcement, the company stated, \"We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.\" One expert, Alex Stamos, Director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, commented that this statement is \"an attempt to poison the well against an Oracle deal where they only take over hosting. And [Microsoft] is right to do so.\"/36</p><p>On September 14, 2020, Oracle announced that it had reached an agreement with ByteDance to \"serve as [the company's] trusted technology provider\" in the United States. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that he had received the proposal./37</p><p>From the terminology used, it appears that the deal may involve a partnership rather than a sale, with TikTok using Oracle's cloud hosting services./38</p><p>This arrangement would keep the source code of the For You feed and algorithmic recommendation engine in the hands of ByteDance. Secretary Mnuchin said that CFIUS will review the proposal and present President Trump with its opinion.</p><p>On September 19, 2020, Oracle announced that Walmart would join its bid for TikTok, with the two companies acquiring 20% of a newly formed company, TikTok Global,/39 with the remaining 80% owned by ByteDance. According to announcements made by the companies, 40% of ByteDance is owned by U.S. investors, which is meant to indicate that the new company would be under majority U.S. ownership./40</p><p>However, this arrangement, along with TikTok keeping the For You recommendation engine algorithm,/41 would not appear to satisfy conditions in President Trump's Executive Orders. In addition to U.S. approval of the proposal being uncertain given its provisions, Chinese approval of the proposal is also uncertain. China's new export regulations appear to forbid transfer of the For You algorithm, but the United States appears to require such a transfer. So, the legal requirements of each country are at odds with each other.</p><p>On September 23, 2020, TikTok filed for an injunction in federal court to stop a ban on the app that is set to take effect on September 27, 2020.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Some believe TikTok and other apps developed and owned by Chinese companies pose a serious security risk to the United States because Chinese companies are governed by China's Cybersecurity Law. Others believe that TikTok is caught up in increasing trade tensions between China and the United States./42</p><p>Threat to Security</p><p>Although TikTok forcefully states that it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, many security and privacy advocates are skeptical. For example, in addition to the lawsuit cited above (see \"Data Sharing\"), the American Civil Liberties Union argues that \"Chinese apps in particular have a reputation for grabbing more data than required to provide their services, often sending information to advertising networks ... [they] are frequently far more abusive than others....\"/43</p><p>The Chinese government obtains data about and created by its own citizens, for purposes that range from censorship to mass surveillance./44</p><p>Other countries have also taken action against TikTok on the grounds of security. India banned TikTok and 50 other Chinese apps in June 2020, calling them a \"threat to sovereignty and integrity.\"/45</p><p>Also in June 2020, the European Union opened an investigation into TikTok to examine possible violations of its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)./46</p><p>Australia had threatened to ban the app, but on August 4, 2020, the country's Prime Minister indicated that TikTok would not be banned; however, he warned Australians against the app, saying it \"connects right back to China.\"/47</p><p>Japan, Turkey, and Pakistan have also taken various measures to protect their countries' users from possibly security risks./48</p><p>Technology Trade Protectionism</p><p>Other observers argue that TikTok is caught in \"the crosshairs of a global technology battle,\"/49 and that a unilateral U.S. ban on any app may be comparable to China's \"Great Firewall.\"/50</p><p>One way to potentially understand U.S. and Chinese government actions in this dispute may be through the concept of techno-nationalism,/51 which refers to a country's refusal or reluctance to import other countries' advanced technology, as well as to export, or to allow other nations to benefit from, its own advanced technology. Within this framework, technology is considered a central pillar of a country's wellbeing:</p><p>Techno-nationalism ... links technological innovation and capabilities directly to a nation's national security, economic prosperity, and social stability.... [It] seeks to attain competitive advantage for its stakeholders, both locally and globally, and leverage these advantages for geopolitical gain./52</p><p>One policy mechanism that nations use to protect what they view as important or sensitive technologies are export controls, rules which limit to which foreign entities and under what circumstances or conditions specific technologies may be sold or licensed./53</p><p>For example, in August 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security at the Department of Commerce announced sanctions that restrict foreign semiconductor companies from selling chips developed or produced using U.S. software or technology to Huawei, another Chinese company, without first obtaining a license to do so./54</p><p>This restriction has been called a \"lethal blow\"/55 to the company.</p><p>Another mechanism is the use of protectionist practices that privilege domestic entities' access to domestic markets. For example, China requires U.S. telecommunications companies to enter into a partnership with a Chinese company to provide services in that country. In June 2020, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report, \"Threats to US Networks: Oversight of Chinese Government Owned Carriers.\" The report notes that while China has access to the U.S. telecommunications market, U.S. companies do not have that same level of access in China.</p><p>China does not provide US telecommunications companies reciprocal access to the Chinese market and requires foreign carriers seeking to operate in China to enter into joint ventures with Chinese companies. These joint ventures often require U.S. companies to give their technology, proprietary know-how, and intellectual property to their Chinese partners.</p><p>Since China was allowed to join the World Trade Organization in 2001, the report notes that \"not a single foreign firm has succeeded in establishing a new joint venture\" to provide basic telecommunications services in China.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Related Congressional Activity</p><p>Congress began taking an interest in TikTok as early as October 2019, when Senator Marco Rubio reportedly called for a formal investigation into whether TikTok posed a national security risk./56</p><p>Later that month, Senators Charles Schumer and Tom Cotton sent a letter/57 to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, expressing their concerns about TikTok and the national security risks they believe it poses. More formally, Congress has scrutinized TikTok in two hearings, and Members have introduced three related bills.</p><p>Hearings</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism has held two hearings on, among other topics, the impact of Chinese smartphone apps on U.S. citizens' privacy:</p><p>* \"How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors\" was held on November 5, 2019./58</p><p>* \"Dangerous Partners: Big Tech and Beijing\" was held on March 4, 2020./59</p><p>TikTok was invited to testify at these hearings, but declined to appear./60</p><p>Legislation</p><p>Three bills have been introduced that would prohibit the use of TikTok and WeChat on U.S. government devices:</p><p>* S. 4452/61 is a bill to prohibit federal employees from downloading or using WeChat on government devices. It was introduced on August 5, 2020, by Senator John Kennedy and referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs the same day.</p><p>* S. 3455,/62 the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, was introduced on March 12, 2020, by Senator Josh Hawley. This bill was passed by the Senate on August 6, 2020, and received in the House the following day. (See S.Rept. 116-250./63)</p><p>* H.R. 6896,/64 also called the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, is the House companion bill to S. 3455. It was introduced on May 15, 2020, by Representative Ken Buck and referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the House Committee on Administration the same day.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The variety of apps available to U.S. users is enormous. Situations similar to the case of TikTok may arise in the future with other apps created by foreign companies. Congress may consider taking one or both of two parallel approaches to address such situations: (1) developing an overarching legal and regulatory framework to protect the security and privacy of U.S. citizens' data and communications, and (2) establishing a uniform, transparent process to assess the risks posed by foreign apps and establish mechanisms to mediate those risks.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 President Donald J.

After discovering a software glitch[1] earlier this year - persisting since 2015 \u2014 the company chose to hide it from consumers and regulators. That is, until The Washington Post exposed[2] it earlier this week. </p><p>The glitch, which has since been fixed, affected the company's Google+ social network and exposed the personal data of nearly 500K users.Google has since shut Google+ down permanently. But questions remain over the timeline, and why the company chose not to disclose the glitch and potential breach. Senators John Thune, Roger Wicker, and Jerry Moran, are now demanding answers. The trio sent a letter[3] to Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Thursday requesting information about the nature of the company's response to the breach. Specifically, the Senators are demanding a copy of an internal company memo allegedly detailing plans to keep quiet about the glitch. Google initially stated it hadn't disclosed the glitch because it wasn't sure if any breach had actually occurred. The Senators' letter calls that motivation into question: But according to an internal memo cited in the article, a factor in Google's decision not to disclose the vulnerability was fear that doing so would draw 'immediate regulatory interest,' bring Google 'into the spotlight alongside or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed under radar throughout the Cambridge Analytical scandal,' and 'almost [guarantee] Sundar will testify before Congress.' The letter calls on Google to provide the Senators with a copy of the memo and to answer a series of seven questions related to its choice not to disclose the glitch and what it thinks its obligations to its users are. The Senators also gave Google a deadline by which to respond with its answers (5:00 PM, 30 October) and set up a staff meeting. It comes off a bit like Thune and company are trying to give Google extra homework for breaking the rules, but the existence of the memo could be perceived as an attempt to subjugate regulatory efforts during a high-profile period for big tech. Google says it had no legal obligation to disclose the glitch. This latest kerfuffle for Google isn't the first time this year it's been in poor graces with members of Congress. Sundar Pichai's refusal to join[4] Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey for a hearing last month raised the ire of Capitol Hill. Now Pichai runs the risk of Congress ordering one that focuses solely on Google. The company appears to be struggling to find its identity[5] under Pichai's leadership. This year alone it suffered employee protests over its involvement in developing AI for the military[6] and for building a censored Search engine[7] for the Chinese government. The latter of which earned it yet another rebuking from the US government when Vice President Mike Pence personally requested[8] Google immediately stop working on it. It can't be a good thing for Google to be on the US government's bad side \u2014 especially considering AI regulation is almost certainly coming to the US. Perhaps Google's parent company, Alphabet, should consider putting someone in charge who doesn't, allegedly, need to be protected from testifying in front of Congress.

If you want something that's not afraid to compete for your attention, try this fine newsletter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Antitrust me</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, after a brief delay, is summoning Big Tech to explain itself Wednesday. Called to testify are the CEOs of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Together, Sundar Pichai, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg oversee companies worth about $6.3 trillion. They didn't get that way by being shy about crushing the competition. Remember Cuil? Quidsi? Palm? Path? Exactly.</p><p> If you're the drinking type, pour a shot every time you hear a CEO talk about obsessing about customers, not competitors; worrying about Chinese competitors waiting in the wings; making a positive difference in society; and having pathetically small market share, really, if you just count it correctly.</p><p> Expect a lot of naive, time-wasting questions from our elected representatives. If you remember Zuckerberg's four-hour House hearing in 2018, it wasn't exactly a shining moment for Congress. (\"You love America, we know that\" was one memorable quote.)</p><p> If subcommittee members were serious, here's what they'd ask:</p><p> Where do you get the data that informs your decisions to buy smaller tech companies? Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet's Google all have unique lenses into online activity, and the cloud infrastructure they are building just adds to their ability to surveil smaller rivals before they become real challengers. One clue Zuckerberg had about Instagram's early hypergrowth was the number of photos users were posting from the startup's mobile app to Facebook's social network.</p><p> What tools do you have to retaliate against startups that refuse to sell to you? Amazon threatened a price war against Quidsi before buying it. After Twitter turned down a Facebook buyout offer, Facebook turned off access to its friends lists.</p><p> Do users have a reasonable way to extract their personal data and share it with competitors? Most big tech companies offer some kind of way to export user data. That doesn't mean it's useful.</p><p> How do you restrain entrepreneurs who sell their startups to you from starting new competitive ventures? The best way Silicon Valley has of self-regulating against would-be monopolists is its ability to churn out new startups. Noncompete agreements prevent that from happening.</p><p> I don't expect any of these topics to come up at the Wednesday hearing, because posturing and lecturing is a lot easier. But in between shots, there might be room for hope.</p><p> \u2014 Owen Thomas, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:othomas@sfchronicle.com\">othomas@sfchronicle.com</email></p><p> Quote of the week</p><p> \"Hopefully they'll look to the facts, understand the values of the people that they're thinking about and understand that we're in this together.\"  \u2014 Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, speaking to CNBC on the prospects for public acceptance of a coronavirus vaccine</p><p> Coming up</p><p> From Capitol Hill to Wall Street: Apple, Facebook and Alphabet report earnings Thursday, the day after their CEOs wrap up their congressional testimony.</p><p> What I'm reading</p><p> Dana Mattoli and Cara Lombardo on Amazon's habit of competing with startups it invests in.

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].Whitney Tilson'e email to investors discussing that the congress is preparing to clash with big tech; fire &amp;#38; fawning; tech is about power; Bezos and Amazon[2] under scrutiny; crackdown on QAnon; Facebook: The Inside Story; Facebook announces plan to break up U.S. government.   Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] It's a big week for four of the five tech giants: Facebook (FB) reports earnings tomorrow, followed by Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. In addition, the CEOs of all four companies - Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Sundar Pichai - respectively, will appear (virtually) tomorrow before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. </p><p>Microsoft (MSFT) reported earnings last week and its CEO, Satya Nadella, managed to escape a Congressional grilling. These are among the most dominant, richly valued companies in history, and have become interwoven into the lives of pretty much every human being on earth - both for better and for worse - so I think they warrant careful scrutiny by investors, the public, the media, and political leaders. When all is said and done, do I think these companies are going to change much - or that regulators might force them to change or even break them up? Sadly, probably not - though even tweaks at the margin are better than nothing (for example, see the article below about the crackdown on QAnon[4]). And their stocks are likely to continue to outperform Below are the most interesting articles I've read on them recentlyCongress Is Preparing To Clash With Big Tech1) Here's a good overview of the hearing from the Washington Post: Congress has battled airlines, banks, tobacco and baseball. Now it's preparing to clash with Big Tech[5].Fire And Fawning2) Run, don't walk, to read NYU marketing professor Scott Galloway's blog post about the hearings: Fire &amp;#38; Fawning[6]. Few (if any) of Galloway's questions will be asked at tomorrow's hearing. But every American should demand that they be asked - and answered - before it's too lateTech Is About Power3) Here's Kara Swisher's take in the New York Times: Tech Is About Power. And These Four Moguls Have Too Much of It[7]. Here's Swisher's July 1 article about this: Here Come the 4 Horsemen of the Techopolypse[8].Tech CEOs Deserve an Apology4) Wall Street Journal columnist Andy Kessler defends the tech giants: Tech CEOs Deserve an Apology[9]. Excerpt: It's tech success vs. lawyers and career politicians who probably have an aide print out their emails. Broadway is closed, so this will be must-see theater. The CEOs' task is to disarm, dissuade and dissipate. No need to upstage congressmen, who are playing a weak hand. Antitrust is driven by consumer harm. Sure, there are screw-ups: Amazon favors its own products, Apple its own apps, Google its own YouTube videos; Facebook collects too much personal data. Yet none of these habits necessarily harm consumers and all could be easily fixed without decadeslong antitrust inquisitions. Lawyers are taught: 'If you have facts on your side, hammer the facts. If you don't, hammer the table.' Expect loud table banging.Bezos And Amazon Are Coming Under Increased Scrutiny5) Jeff Bezos and Amazon are coming under increased scrutiny, as these articles highlight: The Technology 202: Jeff Bezos faces critical exam of his massive e-commerce empire in first Hill testimony[10], Washington Post Jeff Bezos Cast in a Role He Never Wanted: Amazon's D.C. Defender[11], NYT Amazon Met With Startups About Investing, Then Launched Competing Products[12], WSJ The Amazon Critic Who Saw Its Power From the Inside[13], NYTTwitter Cracks Down On QAnon6) No doubt the scrutiny the tech giants are under is a major reason why other social media companies are joining Twitter to remove conspiracy theories from their sites: Twitter crackdown on conspiracy theories could set agenda for other social media[14].Facebook: The Inside Story7) I look forward to reading this book: 'Facebook: The Inside Story' author Steven Levy on how the company compares to Apple and Google[15].Facebook Announces Plan to Break Up U.S. Government8) This parody from The Onion cracked me up: Facebook Announces Plan to Break Up U.S. Government Before It Becomes Too Powerful[16]. In an effort to curtail the organization's outsized influence, Facebook announced Monday that it would be implementing new steps to ensure the breakup of the U.S. government before it becomes too powerful. 'It's long past time for us to take concrete actions against this behemoth of governance that has gone essentially unchecked since its inception,' said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg[17], noting that while the governing body may have begun with good intentions, its history showed a culture of recklessness and a dangerous disregard for the consequences of its decisions.

Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2] It's a big week for four of the five tech giants: Facebook (FB) reports earnings tomorrow, followed by Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL) on Thursday. In addition, the CEOs of all four companies - Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, and Sundar Pichai - respectively, will appear (virtually) tomorrow before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. Microsoft (MSFT) reported earnings last week... and its CEO, Satya Nadella, managed to escape a Congressional grilling.Roubaix Capital's small and mid-cap US equity long/short strategy ended the first quarter of 2020 down 0.3% net. According to a copy of the firm's first-quarter investor update, a copy of which ValueWalk has been able to review, Roubaix's small and mid-cap equity strategy outperformed its benchmark, the HFRI Equity Hedge (Total) Index, by 12.7% Read More[3]  These are among the most dominant, richly valued companies in history, and have become interwoven into the lives of pretty much every human being on earth - both for better and for worse - so I think they warrant careful scrutiny by investors, the public, the media, and political leaders. When all is said and done, do I think these companies are going to change much - or that regulators might force them to change or even break them up? Sadly, probably not - though even tweaks at the margin are better than nothing (for example, see the article below about the crackdown on QAnon[4]). And their stocks are likely to continue to outperform... Below are the most interesting articles I've read on them recently...Congress Is Preparing To Clash With Big Tech1) Here's a good overview of the hearing from the Washington Post: Congress has battled airlines, banks, tobacco and baseball. Now it's preparing to clash with Big Tech[5].Fire And Fawning2) Run, don't walk, to read NYU marketing professor Scott Galloway's blog post about the hearings: Fire &amp;#38; Fawning[6]. Few (if any) of Galloway's questions will be asked at tomorrow's hearing. But every American should demand that they be asked - and answered - before it's too late...Tech Is About Power3) Here's Kara Swisher's take in the New York Times: Tech Is About Power. And These Four Moguls Have Too Much of It[7]. Here's Swisher's July 1 article about this: Here Come the 4 Horsemen of the Techopolypse[8].Tech CEOs Deserve an Apology4) Wall Street Journal columnist Andy Kessler defends the tech giants: Tech CEOs Deserve an Apology[9]. Excerpt: It's tech success vs. lawyers and career politicians who probably have an aide print out their emails. Broadway is closed, so this will be must-see theater. The CEOs' task is to disarm, dissuade and dissipate. No need to upstage congressmen, who are playing a weak hand. Antitrust is driven by consumer harm. Sure, there are screw-ups: Amazon favors its own products, Apple its own apps, Google its own YouTube videos; Facebook collects too much personal data. Yet none of these habits necessarily harm consumers and all could be easily fixed without decadeslong antitrust inquisitions. Lawyers are taught: \"If you have facts on your side, hammer the facts. If you don't, hammer the table.\" Expect loud table banging.Bezos And Amazon Are Coming Under Increased Scrutiny5) Jeff Bezos and Amazon are coming under increased scrutiny, as these articles highlight: Twitter Cracks Down On QAnon6) No doubt the scrutiny the tech giants are under is a major reason why other social media companies are joining Twitter to remove conspiracy theories from their sites: Twitter crackdown on conspiracy theories could set agenda for other social media[10].Facebook: The Inside Story7) I look forward to reading this book: 'Facebook: The Inside Story' author Steven Levy on how the company compares to Apple and Google[11].Facebook Announces Plan to Break Up U.S. Government8) This parody from The Onion cracked me up: Facebook Announces Plan to Break Up U.S. Government Before It Becomes Too Powerful[12]. In an effort to curtail the organization's outsized influence, Facebook announced Monday that it would be implementing new steps to ensure the breakup of the U.S. government before it becomes too powerful. \"It's long past time for us to take concrete actions against this behemoth of governance that has gone essentially unchecked since its inception,\" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg[13], noting that while the governing body may have begun with good intentions, its history showed a culture of recklessness and a dangerous disregard for the consequences of its decisions.

Well, ranking member Jim Sensenbrenner decided to ask Mark Zuckerberg why Donald Trump Jr.'s account was partially restricted by Twitter.</p><p>If you're under the age of 50, you know this is nuts because Zuckerberg is the CEO and founder of Facebook, not Twitter. But the average member of congress is almost 60, and the utter buffoonery on display from both Judiciary Democrats and Republicans demonstrates how incapable Congress is of regulating Big Tech.</p><p>Nearly a quarter century after preeminent conservative economist Milton Friedman warned that Silicon Valley begging the Justice Department to take anti-trust measures against Microsoft would prove to be business \"suicide,\" Republicans and Democrats have joined forces to target private tech companies, and Wednesday's hearing proved not just how misguided their crusade is but also how utterly incompetent their execution would be.</p><p>Save for a handful of questions about Google's collusion with the Chinese Communist Party with Project Dragonfly and a few others about regulatory capture, the hearing was characterized by the House's total lack of understanding of technological and economic reality \u2014 as well as being hijacked by politicians keen on scoring a campaign ad out of \"questioning.\"</p><p>Jim Jordan spent the entirety of his speaking time focusing on bias against conservatives. After using up his speaking time, he feuded with Rep. Mary Scanlon. He responded to a simple request to put his mask back on as follows: \"You wanna talk about masks? What about unmasking Michael Flynn?\"</p><p>Very serious indeed.</p><p>On the Left, the supposed antitrust crusade spent more time questioning Mark Zuckerberg about not policing users' speech than asking Google about China. Multiple hours passed before Jeff Bezos was even asked a single question. When Bezos was finally questioned, he got hard-hitting questions and not at all selfish complaints like, \"A lot of people want to know when HBO Max will be available on your Fire device.\" Brutal.</p><p>Big Tech and plenty of multibillion-dollar corporations massively threaten national security and subvert American interests by colluding with the CCP, and Congress should hold those organizations' feet to the fire. But instead, we were subject to partisan drivel and rank disdain of entrepreneurship. If Congress doesn't even know what platform it's talking about or how email filters work, maybe it shouldn't be trying to control companies built from the ground up by job creators.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2437644410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R9-FV61-DY0W-43HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Ghosh worked on privacy issues at Facebook and tech policy at the Obama White House and is now co-director of the Digital Platforms &amp;#38; Democracy project at Harvard. He has been making the argument that tech companies are fundamentally different from the monopolies that antitrust laws have tried to contain in the past. Current regulators have not been equipped to keep the Big Four accountable or conceptualize their market power accurately. </p><p>Like some others[1], he believes this requires a new framework for thinking about them. This includes the idea that data and attention are the 'new digital currency' \u2014 not just dollars. What we 'spend' on free services like Gmail and Instagram is our time and personal information, which data-driven firms commoditize as ad revenue. And the 'rates' we're being charged \u2014 the endless infringements on our privacy \u2014 are rising.At yesterday's five-and-a-half hour subcommittee hearing, there was partisan questioning on alleged bias[2] towards conservatives, chatter about competing with China and occasional discussion of anti-competitive behavior.But Ghosh felt enough lawmakers had begun to grasp the notion of a new digital economy. \"I think what is clear is that Congress does have some understanding of the business models that are at play here,\" Ghosh told Engadget. \"Congress understands very well that these companies have tremendous power over important markets and they're not hesitating to use that market power in ways that shut down competition.\"For decades, courts and regulators have examined price as the key factor for whether a consumer is being exploited, and therefore whether companies are anti-competitive. But consumers can still be harmed even if a tech service is free, should data collection or harmful algorithms run unfettered. Documents from the Hearing on 'Online Platforms and Market Power: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google\" pic.twitter.com/dXHMzWOTnJ[3] \u2014 House Judiciary Dems (@HouseJudiciary) July 29, 2020[4] A company like Facebook may not just monopolize social media as a market, nor Amazon control e-commerce \u2014 they both have power to monopolize our personal information, too. With advances in data gathering and storage, tech companies now compete on who has the most data[5].While  not all of these issues were addressed directly, pointed questions from Congress members indicated how they were thinking ahead of the final report, said Ghosh. The results of this 13-month investigation could be released as early as August. (Despite over 20 instances[6] of 'I'll get back to you,' recall 2018's hearings involving Facebook and Google where certain members of Congress clearly needed technical support[7] before they could hope to interrogate titans of tech.)For instance, lawmakers hammered the way these companies squeeze smaller rivals \u2014 through acquisitions[8] or by controlling the platform[9] they need to survive. Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado said he was concerned about the resultant 'innovation kill-zone'; Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington questioned Amazon's use of third party seller data to inform its own products, which CEO Jeff Bezos could not wholly deny. Amazon's Assoc. General Counsel told me under oath that Amazon does NOT, 'use any specific seller data when creating its own private brand product.'Reports revealed that was a lie: that they DO access data on third party sellers.So I just asked Jeff Bezos which it is. Watch: pic.twitter.com/MiR7NHI7Y8[10] \u2014 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (@RepJayapal) July 29, 2020[11] Together with Representative Val Demings of Florida calling out[12] the apparent degradation of user privacy standards at Google when they reneged on a pledge not to combine DoubleClick's data with its own after an acquisition, the understanding that data is power took shape.;But it was the chair of the subcommittee, Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who was most blunt. Big Tech can 'extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them,' he said in his opening statement. 'When everyday Americans learn how much of their data is being mined, they can't run away fast enough. But in many cases, there is no escape from this surveillance because there is no alternative. People are stuck with bad options.'Later, Cicilline cited a Breitbart video from Monday with false information about COVID-19 that garnered 20 million views before Facebook took it down. \"Doesn't that suggest, Mr. Zuckerberg, that your platform is so big that even with the right policies in place you can't contain deadly content?\" he said to the Facebook CEO. Zuckerberg denied the claim.Cicilline  connected this with his characterization of Facebook and Google's business models: that they're designed to maximize engagement even if it's detrimental to society. On misinformation, he said: 'Frankly, I believe it strikes at the very heart of American democracy.' Antitrust law needs to be updated, Cicilline said in closing. And of the companies being questioned: 'This hearing has made one fact clear to me: These companies as exist today have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.'The hearing implied that the committee is considering new legislation more than an antitrust inquiry, said Ghosh. The issues Cicilline raised went beyond harm to small businesses, and struck at the political and societal consequences of leaving Big Tech unchecked \u2014 disinformation, hate speech, algorithmic discrimination \u2014 which current antitrust regulation doesn't cover. \"Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated\" 'We need a swift, thorough, comprehensive regulatory reform to address the digital sector because it's wholly different from any other industry \u2014 now or of the past,' Ghosh said.The dominance these companies have extends to a 'monopolization of our intellectual power,' he added \u2014 a control over our ability to communicate. 'When all the speech in a democratic country is moving through one company, that one company tends to have tremendous power. And I think it goes without saying we need to think about how to curb that power through earnest regulatory reform.\"  In this article: antitrust[13], facebook[14], google[15], apple[16], amazon[17], news[18], gear[19] All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
