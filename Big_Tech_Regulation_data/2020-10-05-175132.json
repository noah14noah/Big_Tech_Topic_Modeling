So how can companies stand up on topics they care about, lobby politicians on issues that impact their bottom line, and ensure employees stay friendly no matter who they vote forand all without alienating customers, dragging a company's good name into the political swamp, or denting workplace morale? We spoke with Questrom School of Business experts about how to mix business and politics.</p><p>Speaking out</p><p>Companies may have fears about taking a stand on political and social issues, but consumers are pretty clear about what they want: more than two-thirds of them say it's important that companies get involved in sociopolitical issues, according to social media management platform Sprout Social. Many companies, of course, don't get a choice in whether their brand gets sucked into a larger political conversationas when Donald Trump, Jr., compared Syrian refugees to Skittles, or when Bernie Sanders tore into Amazon as its workers prepared to go on strike. And some find that taking a stand is inevitable.</p><p>\"I don't think the question is should a business speak up on a social or political issue anymore,\" says Kabrina Chang (CAS'92), a clinical associate professor of markets, public policy, and law. \"The demand will come from one or more stakeholders. And when they do, they'll most likely disappoint one of the many groups of stakeholdersit's an unavoidable drawback.\"</p><p>In late 2019, Hallmark found this out the hard way. Three days after airing an ad that featured a lesbian couple kissing at their wedding, the company pulled the spot due to complaints from a conservative activist grouponly to have the company CEO apologize and reinstate the ad the next day.</p><p>\"Hallmark claimed they wanted to avoid controversy,\" says Michael Salinger, Jacqueline and Arthur Bahr Professor, a professor of markets, public policy, and law, \"but given the issue, there was no way to do that.\"</p><p>If a company does decide to join the political conversation proactively, it's imperative that management first consider their brand history, core values, and most important, their audience. \"If a firm knows its customer base and its market segment very welland it's relatively homogenousthey can certainly gain favor by taking a political stance that is in line with their core customers,\" says Dylan Walker, an assistant professor of information systems. One example is outdoor clothing company Patagonia.</p><p>In 2017, after President Trump ordered an 85 percent reduction in the size of Utah's Bears Ears National Monument, Patagonia openly joined the fight for public lands. The designer and retailer positions itself as an activist company, frequently getting involved in politics, from publicly endorsing candidates to suing the government.</p><p>The company has been donating to climate action organizations for years. As a result, speaking up about Bears Ears was consistent with its valuesand those of its customers.</p><p>\"Knowing that a business cannot satisfy every group of stakeholders in making a statement on a controversial issue,\" says Chang, \"the most authentic thing to do is act consistently with what it stands for.\"</p><p>At a time when consumers are both wiser and more jaded about the motives of a company taking a sociopolitical stanceaccording to a 2019 Edelman Trust report, 56 percent of people believe that too many brands are guilty of \"woke-washing,\" using social justice issues to get in the public's good graces with the sole intent of selling morethat consistency is vital.</p><p>\"Connecting a brand to political trends can cause positive outcomes, but also can result in valuation-damaging customer reactions, brand reputation harms, and reverberations through the companyincluding ousting of the CEO,\" says Shuba Srinivasan, Norman and Adele Barron Professor of Management, a professor of marketing. \"I would advise companies not to take a stand if there is not a fit of the brand with the socio-economic-political, or SEP, trend. The bottom line is to assess whether the political category can be claimed with authority as the basis for an enduring brand platform versus a one-off marketing move.\"</p><p>If a company's political or social stance is insincere or inconsistent with its established values, the public will take noticeand call it out on social media. Take the tone-deaf 2017 PepsiCo ad featuring Kendall Jenner that caught flack for trivializing protest movements and co-opting imagery from movements like Black Lives Matter. The ad was so widely criticized that it ran for only a day. But the damage to the PepsiCo brand lasted nearly a year: millennials' willingness to buy a Pepsi plummeted to its lowest level in at least eight years, according to YouGov BrandIndex.</p><p>In the lobby</p><p>Many Americans find the idea of using money and influence to sway policy decisions unpalatable. In fact, Trump's plan for ethics reform in Washington, D.C., and his calls to \"drain the swamp,\" became a keystone of his 2016 presidential campaign. Still, you'd be hard-pressed to find a lawmaker in D.C. who didn't meet with special interest groups. In the last year, many corporationsparticularly big tech firms that were feeling the heat from the press and lawmakers, like Amazon, Apple, and Facebookhave increased their lobbying spend, some by as much as 32 percent.</p><p>\"It is not only proper, but also necessary for companies to engage in lobbying and advocacy for legislative and regulatory treatment that is in their commercial interest. There is nothing inherently wrong or corrupt about that,\" says Salinger, a former director at the Federal Trade Commission. \"When I was at the FTC, the commission was constantly soliciting input from businesses to help them understand their businesses, the markets in which they competed, and the likely effect of proposed regulations. Without that input, I'm sure that the commission would have made worse policy decisions.\"</p><p>Although many companies approach lobbying as an opportunity to improve public policy in a way that's good for society and business, cash-backed politicking didn't get a bad name for no reason.</p><p>\"Obviously, it would be na\u00afve to think that companies wouldor even shoulddo so in an even-handed way,\" says Salinger. \"They should be allowed to make their case. But I consider it immoral and ultimately self-defeating for companies to assert arguments they know to be wrong.\" A prime example: Big Tobacco.</p><p>\"For years, tobacco companies tried to cast doubt on the evidence about the health effects of smoking,\" he says, \"even though they knew the evidence was convicting. Efforts by big energy companies to cast doubt on climate science are similarly problematic.\"</p><p>Salinger advises companies to think carefully about what they're lobbying for.</p><p>\"They should begin by asking why it is in the interest of their shareholders to spend company money on political activity,\" he says. \"They should also ask whether they are participating to clarify issues or to intentionally muddy the waters. If the honest answer is that the company is trying to obscure something that it knows to be true or to promote an idea that it knows to be false, that should be a huge red flag.\"</p><p>Even Zoom chats aren't safe from the effects of political polarization. According to a 2019 study by the Society for Human Resource Management, more than half of employees say political discussions have become \"more common in the last four years\" and close to half say that's led to disagreements.</p><p>Given the potential hit to morale, should companies police discussion of hot-button topics?</p><p>\"Companies can set policies prohibiting political discussionor wearing a MAGA hat, or Feel the Bern shirt,\" says Chang. \"Political affiliation is generally not a protected category in state discrimination lawsMississippi and D.C. are the exceptionsso managers can require workers not to talk about politics or even terminate someone for refusing.\"</p><p>If companies don't want to go that far, how can managers and company leaders encourage political conversations to be constructive?</p><p>\"There is no simple answer,\" Salinger says, \"but I do think companies should make extra efforts to build a culture of respect for customers, suppliers, fellow workers, and so on.\"</p><p>And there is one politics-related move that employers can get behind without creating controversy: giving their staff time to vote.</p><p>\"In a perfect world, employers would give employees the day off to voteor election day would be a holiday or on the weekend,\" says Chang. \"Short of that, employers can give their employees leeway to arrive late or leave early so they can get to their local polls.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123838348</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DV-3FM1-JCBF-S0WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Three days after airing an ad that featured a lesbian couple kissing at their wedding, the company pulled the spot due to complaints from a conservative activist grouponly to have the company CEO apologize and reinstate the ad the next day.</p><p>\"Hallmark claimed they wanted to avoid controversy,\" says Michael Salinger, Jacqueline and Arthur Bahr Professor, a professor of markets, public policy, and law, \"but given the issue, there was no way to do that.\"</p><p>If a company does decide to join the political conversation proactively, it's imperative that management first consider their brand history, core values, and most important, their audience. \"If a firm knows its customer base and its market segment very welland it's relatively homogenousthey can certainly gain favor by taking a political stance that is in line with their core customers,\" says Dylan Walker, an assistant professor of information systems. One example is outdoor clothing company Patagonia.</p><p>In 2017, after President Trump ordered an 85 percent reduction in the size of Utah's Bears Ears National Monument, Patagonia openly joined the fight for public lands. The designer and retailer positions itself as an activist company, frequently getting involved in politics, from publicly endorsing candidates to suing the government.</p><p>The company has been donating to climate action organizations for years. As a result, speaking up about Bears Ears was consistent with its valuesand those of its customers.</p><p>\"Knowing that a business cannot satisfy every group of stakeholders in making a statement on a controversial issue,\" says Chang, \"the most authentic thing to do is act consistently with what it stands for.\"</p><p>At a time when consumers are both wiser and more jaded about the motives of a company taking a sociopolitical stanceaccording to a 2019 Edelman Trust report, 56 percent of people believe that too many brands are guilty of \"woke-washing,\" using social justice issues to get in the public's good graces with the sole intent of selling morethat consistency is vital.</p><p>\"Connecting a brand to political trends can cause positive outcomes, but also can result in valuation-damaging customer reactions, brand reputation harms, and reverberations through the companyincluding ousting of the CEO,\" says Shuba Srinivasan, Norman and Adele Barron Professor of Management, a professor of marketing. \"I would advise companies not to take a stand if there is not a fit of the brand with the socio-economic-political, or SEP, trend. The bottom line is to assess whether the political category can be claimed with authority as the basis for an enduring brand platform versus a one-off marketing move.\"</p><p>If a company's political or social stance is insincere or inconsistent with its established values, the public will take noticeand call it out on social media. Take the tone-deaf 2017 PepsiCo ad featuring Kendall Jenner that caught flack for trivializing protest movements and co-opting imagery from movements like Black Lives Matter. The ad was so widely criticized that it ran for only a day. But the damage to the PepsiCo brand lasted nearly a year: millennials' willingness to buy a Pepsi plummeted to its lowest level in at least eight years, according to YouGov BrandIndex.</p><p>In the lobby</p><p>Many Americans find the idea of using money and influence to sway policy decisions unpalatable. In fact, Trump's plan for ethics reform in Washington, D.C., and his calls to \"drain the swamp,\" became a keystone of his 2016 presidential campaign. Still, you'd be hard-pressed to find a lawmaker in D.C. who didn't meet with special interest groups. In the last year, many corporationsparticularly big tech firms that were feeling the heat from the press and lawmakers, like Amazon, Apple, and Facebookhave increased their lobbying spend, some by as much as 32 percent.</p><p>\"It is not only proper, but also necessary for companies to engage in lobbying and advocacy for legislative and regulatory treatment that is in their commercial interest. There is nothing inherently wrong or corrupt about that,\" says Salinger, a former director at the Federal Trade Commission. \"When I was at the FTC, the commission was constantly soliciting input from businesses to help them understand their businesses, the markets in which they competed, and the likely effect of proposed regulations. Without that input, I'm sure that the commission would have made worse policy decisions.\"</p><p>Although many companies approach lobbying as an opportunity to improve public policy in a way that's good for society and business, cash-backed politicking didn't get a bad name for no reason.</p><p>\"Obviously, it would be na\u00afve to think that companies wouldor even shoulddo so in an even-handed way,\" says Salinger. \"They should be allowed to make their case. But I consider it immoral and ultimately self-defeating for companies to assert arguments they know to be wrong.\" A prime example: Big Tobacco.</p><p>\"For years, tobacco companies tried to cast doubt on the evidence about the health effects of smoking,\" he says, \"even though they knew the evidence was convicting. Efforts by big energy companies to cast doubt on climate science are similarly problematic.\"</p><p>Salinger advises companies to think carefully about what they're lobbying for.</p><p>\"They should begin by asking why it is in the interest of their shareholders to spend company money on political activity,\" he says. \"They should also ask whether they are participating to clarify issues or to intentionally muddy the waters. If the honest answer is that the company is trying to obscure something that it knows to be true or to promote an idea that it knows to be false, that should be a huge red flag.\"</p><p>Even Zoom chats aren't safe from the effects of political polarization. According to a 2019 study by the Society for Human Resource Management, more than half of employees say political discussions have become \"more common in the last four years\" and close to half say that's led to disagreements.</p><p>Given the potential hit to morale, should companies police discussion of hot-button topics?</p><p>\"Companies can set policies prohibiting political discussionor wearing a MAGA hat, or Feel the Bern shirt,\" says Chang. \"Political affiliation is generally not a protected category in state discrimination lawsMississippi and D.C. are the exceptionsso managers can require workers not to talk about politics or even terminate someone for refusing.\"</p><p>If companies don't want to go that far, how can managers and company leaders encourage political conversations to be constructive?</p><p>\"There is no simple answer,\" Salinger says, \"but I do think companies should make extra efforts to build a culture of respect for customers, suppliers, fellow workers, and so on.\"</p><p>And there is one politics-related move that employers can get behind without creating controversy: giving their staff time to vote.</p><p>\"In a perfect world, employers would give employees the day off to voteor election day would be a holiday or on the weekend,\" says Chang. \"Short of that, employers can give their employees leeway to arrive late or leave early so they can get to their local polls.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123841386</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F2-2JD1-DYTH-G4VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A stronger Alliance: Ford and Volkswagen tying up in autonomous tech and electrification. A bitter taste. AB InBev shares pressured as questions swirl over their Asia IPO. And not a fan: President Trump's verdict on Facebook's crypto ambitions. It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to FIRST MOVE this Friday. TGIF, or should I say TG High F. Yes, I'm talking about record highs here for the U.S. majors because that's what we saw yesterday. I can give you a quick look at it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors well and truly hoping here that the Fed is going to come to the rescue ultimately and cut rates in July, I am just not sure anybody really can understand the size or if indeed an emergency exists here right now. We saw the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow breaking fresh granted. The Dow closing above that 2,700 level for the first time ever and right now, futures do look set to add to those gains.</p><p>Among the sectors that we're going to be watching though, energy stocks today. Oil right now sitting at some seven-month highs. We have two brewing storms, in fact driving oil prices. A possible hurricane barreling towards the Gulf Coast currently shuttering half the region's oil output as we await that.</p><p>The timing, of course, particularly difficult given the tensions that we've seen in the Strait of Hormuz between the U.K. and Iran just this week, of course, never mind anyone else. We'll talk through all the details of that shortly.</p><p>But I also want to draw your attention to some of the other things that I've been watching and something else actually that I've spotted. Warning signals from Asia overnight. Singapore reporting its worst second quarter growth numbers in a decade.</p><p>We saw that GDP shrinking from 3.4 percent in the three months to April. What about the Chinese data for June, too? Trade war reality kicking in here once again. Imports dropping sharply, 7.3 percent down from a year earlier. Exports also falling over one percent for the same period, too. I'll tell you what if Jay Powell is looking for evidence of that international slowdown, never mind the United States, then hey, look no further.</p><p>All right, let's get to the drivers and driving is the key here. Volkswagen and Ford announcing a third extension of their tie up, this this time joining forces on autonomous vehicle technology and electric vehicles.</p><p>Volkswagen investing some $2.6 billion into Ford's AI unit, Argo. Peter Valdes-Dapena joins us now. Peter, I think this is what we were all hoping to hear about back in January when they were talking about commercial vehicles. Talk to me about what we're going to see both in autonomous vehicle technology, but also in electric vehicles, too, because the comparative advantage here for both is huge.</p><p>PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR AUTO WRITER: Right. Well, on the autonomous front. Volkswagen is becoming now a co-investor in Argo AI, an independent company that Ford is already an investor and so together Ford and Volkswagen combined will own a majority of Argo AI developing self- driving car technology.</p><p>The other part of this deal is that Volkswagen, as you know, is very heavily investing in electric cars and has huge plans in the EV space. Coming out of their diesel scandal, they really aim the company towards electric cars. And they have a platform, an electric vehicle platform called MEB. Ford is going to be the first outside automaker besides Volkswagen to use that technology. Ford is going to develop two different European market electric cars based on that platform.</p><p>That's a big deal for Volkswagen because it means Volkswagen now has another chance to lower its costs, get some more profit back from that investment, but also established itself as a go-to maker of electric vehicle platforms for the future.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, it's so fascinating. Economies of scale here for Volkswagen, as far as their electric cars is concerned and the platform, the architecture that they built here. Do you think we see more car companies coming to them now and saying, \"Hey, you know, you've produced this technology. You've invested billions and billions of dollars in it now. Can we use it to?\"</p><p>DAPENA: Yes, I bet you probably will. One thing about electric vehicles is they're mechanically very simple, which makes platform sharing even easier, you can build a much greater variety of different vehicles on the same basic engineering with electric vehicle technology.</p><p>And as the CEO of Volkswagen pointed out, you know, kind of, it's all the same underneath. It is batteries, it is electric motors, there's not that much reason for companies to feel like they should develop their own if somebody else has a good engineering platform for this.</p><p>So yes, I'm going to bet that we're going to see other companies probably coming to Volkswagen, wanting to share that as well.</p><p>[09:05:31] CHATTERLEY: And I want to circle back to what we were saying there about autonomous vehicle technology. I mean, we've seen big players in this space, Alphabet - WayMo, out there up front. We can name some of the others. But where does this position Ford and Volkswagen now in this space? Because it's all about scale. It's all about data collection as you and I have discussed on this show many times.</p><p>DAPENA: Yes, well, this puts Ford and Volkswagen, I think in a very good position. Certainly, Ford was already invested in Argo AI, but this certainly helps Volkswagen to jumpstart some of that autonomous driving technology that that company is going to need as well.</p><p>And yes, for something that's really not out there yet, or making any money, it's become a very, very competitive space. And this puts Ford and Volkswagen up against General Motors and Honda with cruise automation based out in San Francisco, it's going to be interesting to watch how this comes out.</p><p>And this is an area where there's a lot of difference in the technologies, a lot of difference in how companies are approaching it with a different philosophy. So it's going to be really interesting to watch.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And I will be speaking to the CEOs of Ford and Volkswagen later on today, and that will air on \"The Express.\" Can't wait for that. Peter Valdes-Dapena, in the meantime, thank you so much for that. Fascinating to watch.</p><p>All right. Next driver sour taste for AB InBev, investors today amid reports, it might delay its IPO at the Asia unit. Paul La Monica has all the details on this. Paul, this was going to be perhaps the biggest IPO of the year. We're talking more than $9 billion.</p><p>You know, when I look at the details here, the pricing, the way that the book run is on this, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan approached it, I can see all sorts of problems here. What do you think on this one?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, I agree, Julia. I think the biggest issue is that this IPO, which if it happens would be bigger than Uber. The problem is that investors realize that AB InBev wants to do this deal so that it can pay down some of its debt. This is a company has more than $100 billion in net debt. It has a very bloated balance sheet. It also wants to do acquisitions in Asia.</p><p>But as a result, AB InBev's intentions are well known. So the buyers of the possible IPO, they're the ones with the upper hand and they look at this valuation, and I think they realize that it is a bit frothy -- pardon the beer pun, if you will -- and that is going to lead AB InBev to have to come to a realization that if they want to do this deal, they may have to cut the price, even though it means they won't get as much money from it as they were hoping. The buyers are in the driver's seat right now, not AB InBev.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more. When I looked at this and looked at the relative valuations of the competitors in the area, I was like, wow, that's the low end of their anticipated pricing here, I just think perhaps they were drinking some hard stuff when they were thinking about pricing this one, Paul.</p><p>But to what extent is this also, do you think about market conditions? I mean now, we are just looking at what else is going on over there in Swiss Re pulled an IPO. They suspended the Reassure Group PLC yesterday. So is this to some degree to do with market conditions, the problems that we've seen in Hong Kong with the protest, the broader tensions between the United States and China here? Do you think it could be about that, too?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that might play a part in what's going on with AB InBev. Clearly, right now, there are more worries about the rest of the world's economies slowing in light of trade tensions particularly, Europe and China.</p><p>But make no mistake, China is still a very attractive market for the beer companies, which face stagnant growth in the U.S. and other developed markets. AB InBev wants to make some acquisitions, they're facing tough competition from rivals like Heineken and Carlsberg. They need to probably do this deal even if they have to cut the price because it's not as if the Chinese consumer has suddenly lost their taste for Western beers. That's not really the case at all.</p><p>So I think it's less about some of these macro concerns right now and just an issue of it's a bloated company with a lot of debt. The market recognizes that. So why should they pay up for this when they can force AB InBev to sell it at a more attractive price?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And they also didn't get big institutional investors involved at to anchor it either. So some really strange mistakes here.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, that was a key one definitely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Paul La Monica -- thank you. Yes. Paul La Monica, I don't get too excited about this, but watch this space. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>[09:10:05] CHATTERLEY: All right. Next driver, the President -- President Trump tweeting, he is quote, \"not a fan of crypto currencies.\" He suggested that Facebook might also need a banking charter for their currency, Libra. He says, the quote, \"Dependable dollar is the only real currency,\" just don't buy it of the course because he wants it weaker. Naughty.</p><p>Hadas Gold joins us now on this story. He also said, Hadas, here that actually this facilitates illegal activity. I mean, some could argue cash does that, too, but he has not pulled his punches here on cryptocurrencies.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: No, Julia, he has not pulled his punches on cryptocurrency. Just to remind everybody, Libra is the cryptocurrency that Facebook announced last month and they're doing this setting up a Swiss nonprofit. They're doing this in a separate way than what we've seen for example, Bitcoin do. They are bringing in 28 other companies. Big names, like Uber, Spotify and MasterCard, each of which has pledged to invest at least $10 million into the project, which they hope to launch in 2020.</p><p>But there's already been a lot of pushback on Libra, of course, coming from Donald Trump most recently. He tweeted yesterday, \"I'm not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which he said are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other legal activity.\"</p><p>\"Similarly, Facebook's Libra as a virtual currency will have little standing or dependability if Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations like other banks, both national and international.\"</p><p>He goes on to say that the only real currency in the United States is the dollar, but he's actually not the only one who is coming out against or questioning Libra and actually in one of the rare moments of agreement with the Fed Chair Jay Powell. He is echoing what Jay Powell actually told Congress just this week, which he said that he has serious concerns over privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.</p><p>And so his comments could be as a result of the Jay Powell comments in Congress this week, or also there was a Social Media Summit at the White House yesterday, and though the Social Media Summit was more about conservatives and whether conservatives are somehow censored online, this is part of Donald Trump's general sort of antipathy towards a lot of these Big Tech giants that he says is biased against him.</p><p>So it could be also a reaction as a way that he thinks he could get sort of in Facebook's way, but as I said, there's a lot of legitimate concerns around Libra. And there's sort of this trend that we have, we're seeing with regulators and with politicians' unease over a lot of these tech companies becoming bigger than what they were.</p><p>I mean, Facebook was just a social networking site a few years ago, and now they're getting into the currency world. You see the same thing with Amazon, getting into web hosting, getting into supermarkets, so we're kind of seeing all of this concern come around how big and powerful these tech companies can be. And David Marcus, who is the cofounder of Libra tweeted that they want to work with regulators, and that's why they actually he said, shared the plans early.</p><p>He'll be in Washington next week in front of lawmakers where they're going to have hearings specifically about this cryptocurrency, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, the global remittances business, a $500 billion industry is ripe for disruption, particularly in emerging markets. People pay way too much money to transfer money. I just didn't believe that Facebook actually is the right company here to be pushing this.</p><p>I just -- the trust isn't there, but to your point, and it's a really important one, Facebook's Libra is going to be discussed by the Senate Banking Committee next week and the rumors suggest that's going to be a tough hearing -- Hadas.</p><p>GOLD: It will be a tough hearing for David Marcus and they do seem ready for it and you're right, especially about the idea of all these people out there who aren't necessarily banked with specific banks. Those are the people that Facebook is trying to target and there's just a lot of concerns. Because of Facebook's history with security with data that a lot of these politicians and regulators are looking at them and say, \"We don't trust you to handle something like a currency that could disrupt the market.\"</p><p>Because think about it, think about how many users Facebook has, something like two billion users. So imagine what that could do to monetary policy around the world, if even just half of those users started using this cryptocurrency.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, as we've discussed with Scott Galloway on this show, it could be huge. Just again, I am not sure Facebook is the company to do it right now. Hadas Gold, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world. Turkey has received its first shipment of Russia's S400 missile defense system. A Russian plane landed in Ankara earlier today. The delivery is expected to continue in the coming days. The move comes despite the U.S. warning over NATO allies purchasing quote \"weapons from our adversaries.\"</p><p>Monsoon rains are causing extensive damage at Rohingya Muslim refugee camps in Bangladesh. Thousands of families have been displaced after landslides destroyed their makeshift homes. UNICEF says at least two children have drowned and there's more rain in the forecasts.</p><p>Millions of Americans along the Gulf Coast are bracing for a possible hurricane. Tropical Storm Barry is closing in on Louisiana. It could reach hurricane force when it makes landfall on Saturday. Barry is expected to dump half a meter of rain on the ground already threatened by the swollen Mississippi River. A state of emergency has been declared in New Orleans.</p><p>Natasha Chen is there for us. Natasha, a huge problem here because you've already seen heavy rainfall, swollen Mississippi River and now having to deal with a potential storm, too. Talk about the preparations that are being made there and what we can expect.</p><p>NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right. Well, Julia, we are seeing a lot of floodgates being closed. There's one just down the levee right there, we saw a crew closing that gate yesterday. That would help a great deal in preparation for this. They've also closed pedestrian gates close to the river walk downtown, which is right across from us there.</p><p>And you can take a look at the Mississippi River right here, as you mentioned, very swollen. You can see there by the large tree is the top of a fire hydrant, so you can just tell how far out people are typically able to walk this time of year. But right now it is all water.</p><p>The good news is that the water is not expected to top over this levee where we are standing, Julia and the authorities are hoping that it stays this way.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And yet, for many of us, I think we remember the devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina 14 years ago now, but the infrastructures since then have been updated. The pumping systems, the storm barriers. This is going to be a crucial test of everything that's been put in place since then, surely.</p><p>CHEN: Yes, and they have been tested since Katrina with other storms, too. The challenge with this one though, is because we have a record flood level of the Mississippi River. This is now more than 250 consecutive days of this river being at flood stage. You're adding a storm on top of that.</p><p>Typically, the river is not this high. So this is sort of an unprecedented situation for them. The Mayor of New Orleans says that while they have 118 pumps that are functional and ready to go, this is still not a situation they can simply pump their way out of.</p><p>Right now, the City of New Orleans is telling people to be prepared to shelter in place while there are a few other parishes that have certain areas under mandatory evacuation. And of course, local authorities also have buses that are ready to go in case people need to leave at the last minute -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Natasha Chen there and stay safe this weekend. All right. We're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, as Tropical Storm Barry barrels through the Gulf of Mexico, oil of course and the industry there in its path.</p><p>And Daimler's great profit warning sending shares lower. The carmaker expects to sputter through the quarter with deep losses. Stay with us. We've got all the details. You're with CNN.</p><p>Cleaning the outside of your house and exhausting all day affair.

The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also positioned for a strong open here.</p><p>Let's talk about what we're going to see here as we head into earnings season. Lindsey Bell is Investment Strategist at CFRA Research and joins me now. Lindsey, Happy Friday.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARH: Happy Friday.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Fresh record highs for U.S. markets. They expect Jay Powell to ride to the rescue here whether or not we see an emergency. Is there an emergency here? Is there a need for a rate cut?</p><p>BELL: I mean, it's really hard to square the economic environment that we're in right now with the need for a rate cut. But his concern really revolves around inflation and trade. He doesn't want inflation to get too low and also to turn into a Japan situation. And then also trade, it's like kind of like might be buying some time for Trump and the trade negotiations to really get on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you've mentioned trade negotiations there twice. To what extent have corporates baked that into the cake for their forecasts here because I know this is one of the things that you see, it's going to be critical as we head into earnings season, simply what they say about the likelihood of a deal this year?</p><p>BELL: Yes, absolutely. I'm a little bit worried about this. Numbers have come down, especially for the third quarter. We're looking for flattish earnings there. With the fourth quarter, we're looking for a robust seven percent earnings growth.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow.</p><p>BELL: Yes, and that's pretty big. So to the extent that trade is baked into, I don't think it is at all. And I think that investors really could be disappointed once second quarter earnings season gets underway, because you're going to see outlooks and guidance from CEOs and CFOs come down because it needs to, they need to be prepared in the event that the trade tensions escalate.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So for the second quarter though, what we've seen and what we tend to see coming into these earnings season, is analysts bring their expectations down and they bring them down, they bring them down and strangely enough then, earnings feat because the expectations are so low.</p><p>BELL: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is this going to be any different?</p><p>BELL: No, I don't think we're going to have any different situation here. You're absolutely right. For the second quarter, we're looking for a decline in earnings of 1.8 percent, which is pretty low. It's come down from a positive half a percentage point at the beginning of the quarter.</p><p>So the numbers are weak. I think we're going to get a lot better growth, like two and a half percent somewhere in there was what we should actually see. Look, these guys haven't missed estimates since 2009 and in the entirety of this bull market.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the analysts are rubbish, we need to like get a grip here. I said it, not you. What we've also seen, though, is that nine percentage point rally in U.S. stocks since the first of June. So we're coming into it where there's also a lot of good news baked into the cake here.</p><p>So sort of explain what the likely reaction is, given that there's a lot of good news in the price here, too.</p><p>BELL: Yes, it's pretty tough when you have a run like that in the stock market before earnings season starts, especially in an earnings season that there's some questions about the operating environment, especially because of trade.</p><p>It's going to be a rough patch to go. And we've seen a couple early reporters. And if they beat on bottom and top line and guidance is good, then you see the stocks rally, but these guys that are lowering guidance are getting crushed faster than who reported yesterday. And that was one example where they talked about how trade is impacting their business.</p><p>They've actually been raising prices for their customers, and they've been able to pass that through to offset tariffs. But they're seeing inflation in their own cost of goods. So that's the problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and investors are sort of moving, reacting very quickly - -</p><p>BELL: Very quickly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And maybe this is a real negative here. Talk to me about what we're seeing between the majors here and some of the smaller cap stocks because I've been seeing this earlier this week, there's a 17 or 18 percentage point difference in performance -- under performance for the small caps here over the last year. To me, that's a warning. Should we be listening to it?</p><p>BELL: I would also point to what you're seeing in gold. Gold is rallying, and the gold has actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since the beginning of May. So the gold us up 9 percent since the beginning of May while the stock market, the S&amp;P 500 is up about three percent since then.</p><p>So you've seen that outperform and I think the weakness that you're seeing in the small caps, too, goes to show that investors are really putting their money in large caps, safe havens with good balance sheets, high quality stocks, and gold and some of these -- it just points to the fact that investors are getting worried.</p><p>[09:25:34] CHATTERLEY: Yes, there's an increasing dizziness despite the fact that you know, Jay Powell is talking about rate cuts here. If we see a resolution to the trade deal, and forgive me, and our viewers if I keep asking that question, does that make small caps then a great buying opportunity, given the underperformance and the lack of rally that we've seen relative to the big ones, the big caps?</p><p>BELL: Exactly. I think that's the case, because these guys are shielded from trade, which is like why it's confusing that they haven't been rallying. But the problem with the small caps is they're highly levered. They're much more levered than the large caps are at this point in time, they really have taken advantage of the low interest rates and to fill out their businesses.</p><p>So I think that that's going to be an area of pressure until we have trade resolution where we know that we can sustain economic growth here in the U.S. and that's really what it's all about.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We have 20 seconds, which sector surprises us in earning season? Is it technology? What do you think actually outperforms here?</p><p>BELL: I think technology could outperform. I think numbers have come down quite a bit and that could be an area of surprise -- positive surprise. I mean, we have heard from some semiconductor companies, and the numbers are a little bit better than the dire expectations so --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What the chips and the techs, too. Lindsey Bell, great to have you with us. Thank you.</p><p>BELL: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Lindsey Bell there. CFRA. The market open is next. Plenty more to come.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and the opening bell here at the New York Stock Exchange for the final time this week. We were anticipating a higher open for stocks and that is exactly what we've got adding to gains from yesterday's trading session. Of course we've got the S&amp;P 500 now above that 3,000 level. Dow crossing the 27,000 mark. It's going to be fascinating to see what we get through our earning season.</p><p>But right now, as I said earlier, TG high F. Record highs for these U.S. majors. Not so great news though for Daimler. Let's take a look at what's going on with that their shares under pressure today, after the firm issued its fourth profit warning in the past year. They're expecting a Q2 loss of nearly $2 billion.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us now. Second in a month, fourth profit warning in a year and whatever it is, you name it, we can throw at it -- airbag issues, the emissions scandal, a softening market anyway. Challenged, I think that's the word for Daimler right now.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: But a kitchen sink, we have there. A hefty loss for the second quarter. $1.8 billion, now as you said, this is certainly not the first profit warning we've had from them in the last year, it is the fourth.</p><p>Now, there is a new CEO and a new CFO at the top. And I think that is why we're seeing this. They want to have a fresh start. It involves doing a big deep clean of the company and they have uncovered quite a few nasties.</p><p>Top two that are really weighing down on this report. New information they say related to the Takata airbag recall. They are putting that at $1.1 billion; also reassessing the projected cost of dieselgate in the Mercedes Benz division, that's going to cost $1.8 billion.</p><p>Now you might think that this kitchen sinking would please investors, you might see a bit of a relief rally, not -- we saw shares fall three percent. They have come back a little since then.</p><p>But speaking to analysts today, Julia, there's a sense that maybe there's a trust issue for investors, because this is new management. But this is actually the second profit warning they've given within just a few weeks, are the one-offs, really one-offs? What does it mean for the dividend? And what about the overall health of the underlying business? It doesn't look good.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a case of isn't it, one and done or we keep doing this? Are we over the worst now? Are we going to keep hearing more bad news as far as this company is concerned, even with the bad news that we see in the price right now? But it does underscore a bigger issue here, which is that the entire industry is struggling with softness, weakened profit, so the time when they need to be pumping money into investments for the future of cars, whether it's electrification or autonomous vehicle technology. It's a tough environment right now.</p><p>STEWART: It couldn't really be tougher, and they're certainly not alone. We had that profit warning from BMW earlier in the year. They're also actually looking for a new CEO. But yes, you're facing weak demand in almost every single market, particularly China, which is of course such an important market, drop off in sales in diesel, huge cost in investing in the future as you said, because if you don't, you will fall even further behind. And that's why we're seeing all these big joint venture.</p><p>So Daimler has partnered with BMW, both pretty troubled, though, but both partnering together for the future. And of course today as announced, Volkswagen and Ford, they're all in it together.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. And they are trying to share the costs here, the cost burden of technology and share of that technology, indeed, is critical here. What about China? What were they saying about China, because this is a huge theme for all of these guys and the softening demand that we see there.</p><p>STEWART: So in its preliminary report, nothing said specifically on China. It will be interesting to see in the broader report that comes out because we saw just earlier this week one earnings report is saying that they saw car production fall 12 percent in the first half of this year. So I expect to see further numbers to do with that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's going to be fascinating to see. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that. All right, let's move on and take a look at what's going on in the energy market. Because we do see oil trading at around a seven-week highs, all eyes, of course, on Tropical Storm Barry, as we mentioned in the northern Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>John Defterios joins us now. John, let's talk about the short-term dynamics. We've got the storm. We've got the impacted facilities in that region, but also, more broadly, what we've been discussing this week in the Strait of Hormuz and the ongoing tensions with Iran and vessels there. It's a lot for investors to keep an eye on right now.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Yes, I think, Julia, we have to break this market down into two different categories, as you're suggesting there, the short-term risk and the longer term glut that's emerging and we can cover that shortly.</p><p>But let's break down the Double Trouble that's in the energy market today. I think we have to put Iran at the top of the list here because of what's been transpiring over the last hour or so with the Iranians from the Revolutionary Guard camp suggesting that the U.K. has to release this tanker to avoid a quote unquote \"dangerous game.\"</p><p>Now, this is very tricky on behalf of the Iranians because they're honing their attention in on the U.K., picking one target, particularly, perhaps in this energy transition and leadership transition that's taking place in the U.K. with Boris Johnson siding with Donald Trump. The Iranians, focusing on the U.K. deciding to take out a single target, perhaps, going forward.</p><p>[09:35:24] DEFTERIOS: Khalid Al-Falih, the Minister of Energy in Saudi Arabia told us at OPEC that Iran serves as a global threat to energy supplies here. This is what he is talking about -- stepping in, intervening at different occasions. And we can't overlook Barry, this topic that you'd led into the segment with here.</p><p>We already have seen 53 percent of the facilities shuttered in Louisiana when it comes to oil, about 45 percent of the facilities when it comes to gas. And I've seen early estimates here of a perhaps a billion dollars' worth of damage. And the energy companies don't want to take any risk because of the refining capacity. It comes in particular out of Louisiana.</p><p>You said we're hovering around a seven-week high here, you have to go back to the end of May when we were at $70.00 a barrel. And we're hovering around $66.00 to $67.00 for the international benchmark -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, I do want to circle back to what you were saying about the IAEA and the warning that we got from them this week about the supply cut hitting in 2020 despite all the efforts that OPEC and OPEC-plus are making to strip capacity out of the market.</p><p>I mean, these guys are saying that we'd need to see a further 800,000 barrels a day strip back in order to prevent significant weakening of prices here. I mean, I can only imagine the howls going on over OPEC for the OPEC members here and OPEC-plus, of course, Russia.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes, they're trying to stay with the strategy here that they've had going for two and a half years between Russia, Saudi Arabia and all 24 members of the OPEC-plus structure right now. But whether it's OPEC on Thursday, or the International Energy Agency on Friday, that message is the same, we have a glut forming in 2020, a tighter market in the second half of this year.</p><p>But the glut emerging in 2020, let's take a look. The real reason is the expanding U.S. production. Let's go back to 2018, knocking on the door of 11 million barrels a day, surge into what? 12.4 in 2019. And look at the surge for 2020.</p><p>We've added basically with the United States in the last five years, the scale of Iraq to the market. So OPEC had to make a call going back four or five years ago, the previous Energy Minister, Ali Al-Naimi wanted to flood the market to keep shale out of the market.</p><p>In the collaboration with Russia, Saudi Arabia is basically saying we're going to serve as the global shock absorber for the shale market. We want to keep oil prices $60.00 to $65.00 a barrel. We want to keep the surplus under control and having them doing that, you have to make space for shale.</p><p>And basically the Saudi Minister said, \"Look, we were producing about 9.4 million barrels when the U.S. shale was expanding. We're around 10 million barrels, we're not losing market share. We're earning more money per barrel. But we have to respond to this revolution that's taking place in the United States.</p><p>And if we slow down, Julia, 2020 is going to be even nastier when it comes to the glut that's forming that the IAEA is talking about today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, one heck of a tug of war. What is that breakeven level now for the shale guys? At what point did they look at the price and go, \"Actually, we have to strip back again and stop pumping so much because it's not working for us either because the oil prices has got so low?\"</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, it's a very clever question that you're asking, because if we had this conversation two and a half years ago, most of the field's breakeven price was $50.00 to $55.00 a barrel. They've become much more competitive with $30.00 to $35.00 a barrel.</p><p>But you hear the cries from Wall Street suggesting here, should the U.S. be throttling forward here with so much production on the market serving as a disruptor if you're not making that much per barrel, knowing that they're being propped up by Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Sources within that OPEC-plus apparatus are saying they're playing a medium term game and this is where it gets very interesting. They don't think that the shale expansion can last for better than five, six, seven years. So they're willing to be the balancer of the market right now hoping that this revolution that we see tops out in by -- say what? 2030 maximum going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, fascinating. John Defterios, I've missed you. Great to have you back.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Thank you. I've been traveling everywhere.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I know you have. We missed you. Okay, good. All right. Let's move on and talk about the global movers that we are watching in this session today. Ford -- higher -- announcing it is extending its global collaboration with Volkswagens, as we've been discussing on the show, adding autonomous and electric cars to the joint venture that they announced back in January.</p><p>The automakers are saying there they will remain independent and fiercely competitive. But on technologies of the future, they're working together.</p><p>[09:40:01] CHATTERLEY: Illumina also in focus in the session. The biotech firm slashing its revenue expectations. It predicts Q1 revenue at some $835 million. That's significantly lower than Wall Street's estimates. It also says -- actually, I'm going to actually hand over to my colleagues at CNN U.S. actually for some breaking news.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: ... underage minor girls. Again, if you're just joining us, the breaking news this morning, the Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta is resigning. This is after, remember, that defiant press conference that he held on Wednesday defending vehemently the decisions he made while he was a prosecutor in Southern Florida on the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p><p>And, remember, Epstein will be in court on Monday. The President, we were told was pleased with Acosta's performance in that press conference Wednesday. But something has changed in the last 24 hours. We heard rumblings that the President may not still feel that way.</p><p>What contributed to this, of course, our reporters are all working their sources. But this is really big. Jeff Mason, White House reporter for \"Reuters\" is back with us. My colleague, Brynn Gingras as well, who's been covering this. And Brynn, let me just turn to you first. Remind people, if they're not as familiar with this story, the highlights of what has happened in the last few days for Acosta.</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's been a lot, right? I mean and you kind of summarized it really well there. The big thing that sticks out in my mind is, yes, he came in that press conference, he placed a lot of blame on other attorneys, essentially saying that they didn't do their jobs. We're the super heroes. We jumped in. We actually, you know, helped bring some sort of agreement, which was the big shady agreement, as we can probably call it. And he didn't apologize. He wasn't sorry for anything that came of it.</p><p>HARLOW: And, actually, when he was asked by a reporter, would you, you know, give Epstein the same deal again, he didn't say no.</p><p>GINGRAS: Right, he didn't say no. He kind of said, you know, we -- we can't turn back the clock in a sense and try to sort of think about what we gave him and think, was it good or bad, because you have to take it in that time reference.</p><p>But the other thing that sticks out too is that he said he had the President's support, right?</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>GINGRAS: But we also know the President has been very careful about distancing himself from Epstein from the very beginning.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>GINGRAS: So in that sense it's not 100 percent surprising.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>GINGRAS: But certainly this is a huge development.</p><p>HARLOW: Jeffrey Epstein, a very just high-flying hedge fund guy, very politically connected. The President called him a terrific guy, Jeff Mason, back in 2002. Former President Bill Clinton has flown on his plane numerous times, he has been to his homes. And now because, you know, it's clear that it's the fallout from this that is why Acosta is resigning.</p><p>What has your reporting told you over the last 24 hours here in terms of the turn that apparently the President has taken on him?</p><p>JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS: Well, number one, yes, this is clearly the reason why he is resigning. And, number two, I think the President was watching closely during that press conference and must have decided that the fallout was going to be too great or was too great.</p><p>He's just outside right now talking to the press, and Acosta joined him on his way out to get on Marine One. And so he's giving him sort of a send- off in some ways, which he doesn't always do for people who he fires.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>MASON: So he is, I think, trying to show that he still likes him and likes the fact that he performed well as Labor Secretary, and they were talking about the job numbers being good. But clearly he also is not eager to have somebody at the helm of an important department who is tainted, and now he is.</p><p>HARLOW: One thing -- so we're learning this and we're going to play you, of course, everything the President and Acosta says on the South Lawn as soon as we get that in here, so standby for that.</p><p>But the Labor Secretary, apparently we're hearing, Jeff, called the President this morning and said that he thought it was the right thing to step aside.</p><p>What I find interesting is that it has really been a call from Democratic lawmakers, Democratic senators and Members of the House for him to resign, like Schumer and Pelosi, not Republicans at this point yet.</p><p>MASON: Yes, I think that is interesting. And it's also interesting to the extent that that may have played a role in this. I mean usually in Washington, you get pressure from both sides and the Democrats, obviously, as you say, Poppy, certainly upped that pressure on him.</p><p>And have also, in that sense, kept the issue in the news. And that's probably one of the bigger things for President Trump. I mean the story of Jeffrey Epstein, whether or not the Secretary did well in his press conference the other day or not, is not going away.</p><p>And the more and more we continue to watch that, hear about the charges, see what happens to him, Acosta's name is going to continually be part of that narrative.</p><p>[09:45:08] HARLOW: Right. Sarah Westwood joins me outside of the White House, I believe -- in Milwaukee, I apologize. That's where the President is going.</p><p>All right, so this is huge news, Sarah. What can you tell us about what has happened within the White House in the last 24 hours? Because, frankly, last, all our viewers heard is that the President was pleased with how Acosta has been handling himself.</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right, Poppy, but there was some questioning of whether Acosta's connections to that extremely lenient plea deal that Jeffrey Epstein received back in Florida about a decade ago was going to become an even greater distraction for this administration. Sources told CNN that President Trump and his White House team were waiting to see how the coverage of Acosta-Epstein connections developed over the past week.</p><p>We know that earlier this week President Trump and Secretary Acosta spoke. President Trump requested that Acosta go out and address this more forcefully. And Acosta said in that press conference that he had a solid relationship with President Trump and he acknowledged that, \"At some point, if the President is no longer satisfied with my performance, then I would go,\" saying, \"I serve at the pleasure of the President.\"</p><p>And President Trump, this morning, speaking to reporters on the South Lawn at the White House, as he's heading here to Wisconsin, said that it was the Secretary of Labor's decision to leave. He did not force Acosta out. That is what he made clear to reporters.</p><p>But there were a lot of pressure building of Democrats, of 2020 hopefuls, calling for Acosta's resignation. Acosta apparently telling the President, Poppy, that he did not want his connections to his explosive case to become a distraction for the administration.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. And, Sarah, let's remind people that part of Acosta's mandate as Labor Secretary is to oversee any human trafficking. I mean that -- the irony of that cannot be overstated, right? I mean that is part of his mandate. And he is the boss who signed off a decade ago on this sweetheart plea deal for Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Stay with us, Sarah. Let me bring Brynn back in, because, Sarah, I want to go back to you on sort of the judgment and the vetting of the White House in a number of picks, including this pick, because we knew a lot of this before his confirmation hearing. Can you explain to people the highlights of the deal that Acosta gave to Epstein?</p><p>GINGRAS: Well, it's -- and so everyone has been calling it a sweetheart deal, right? And the reason is because Acosta's office at that time actually drafted an indictment, a Federal indictment against Epstein. I believe it was 53 pages long, right?</p><p>And then all of a sudden a deal is made between Epstein's attorneys and Acosta, basically making Epstein plead to a lesser state charge. Of course we know Federal and state charges, there's a big difference there.</p><p>HARLOW: Sure.</p><p>GINGRAS: And that state charge basically meant that Epstein would have to go to jail -- not prison, jail -- for a year, and he was even allowed to leave on work-release, conduct his business deals, several times leave the jail, go do his work and then return to jail. And this is for a 13-month period.</p><p>And then in addition to that, the most important part of this was that deal was never discussed with the victims who came forward against Epstein.</p><p>HARLOW: And we're talking about dozens of underage women, 13, 14-year-old girls.</p><p>GINGRAS: Dozens of underage women. And we're talking about dozens of reports, too. I mean the reporting of this, before Epstein's office even got -- I'm sorry, Acosta's office even got involved, it was -- it was a lot. I mean there was so much investigation that was done, not only by local authorities in Florida, but in other states. The F.B.I. was involved. So he had all the information in front of him --</p><p>HARLOW: Well --</p><p>GINGRAS: And yet there was --</p><p>HARLOW: And I'd be remiss not to mention, Sarah Westwood, if we still have you, White House reporter, that the Southern District of New York now is the lead on this. I mean the Southern District of New York is now taking a deep, deep look at Jeffrey Epstein and thereby, obviously, will look at, again, the deal that was made for him by Acosta, right?</p><p>WESTWOOD: That's right. And there was a lot of scrutiny on that deal. It's not just on the charges that Epstein is now facing in New York and what he did face in Florida ten years ago, but also on how prosecutors at that time behaved, what they did with the evidence that was given to him and why victims at the time were not notified of the plea deal that Epstein ultimately accepted.</p><p>Acosta faced questions about that at his press conference, as well as, as you mentioned, how he can continue to oversee a big parts of the administration's human trafficking policies when his handling of a case that is now involving alleged sex trafficking is being scrutinized this way.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>WESTWOOD: And Acosta did attempt to answer those questions earlier this week, but, naturally, those questions are going to continue, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. And so we have some reporting as well, Sarah, from our colleague, Kaitlan Collins, also a White House reporter. Let me just read this to you, adding that the President was having his doubts about Acosta, people close to the President were questioning how long Acosta would last because the President went from praising him earlier this week and urging him to defend himself, to privately questioning why the victims had not been notified about the deal.</p><p>[09:50:03] HARLOW: That's very interesting, Jeff Mason, if we still have you with us, that what seem to have turned the page here for the President is his learning more about the lack of notification to the victims in this plea deal, which, by the way, a Federal judge has subsequently ruled was illegal. It broke the Victims' Rights Act.</p><p>MASON: Yes, I mean, I think that's one of the -- that's one of the issues in this whole case that has been the most troubling to everyone who has seen it. And I'm not sure that Secretary Acosta had an answer to that at his press conference the other day that was enough to assuage the concerns of people and apparently that affected the concerns of President Trump as well.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's the victims here who, you know, everyone's heart has gone out to. And even Secretary Acosta indicated in his press conference that, you know, that he's seen the testimony and seen the accounts of some of those victims in the meantime, and that it was a concern to him as well.</p><p>But why didn't they have a hand in approving or giving a thumb's up or probably a thumb's down to what the Secretary or the then prosecutor was doing? That's something that is troubling to a lot of people, including apparently the President.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. And when you talk about, Jeff, how many people around the President in these Cabinet positions have resigned, have been forced out, a lot of -- because of their past and because of things that could have been better vetted.</p><p>And this was brought up in the confirmation hearing, but a lot was not known until after Julie Brown's great reporting for \"The Miami Herald\" in November.</p><p>Okay, again, the breaking news, the Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, is resigning. The fallout from this sweetheart plea deal he gave to a sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein, who is very connected politically. We'll have much more on the other side.</p><p>[09:56:14] HARLOW: All right, we are back with our breaking news, and it is significant this morning. The Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, has resigned. This is in the fallout from the sweetheart plea deal that he led for known sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein a decade ago that has come into much more stark focus this week as the Southern District of New York has brought new charges against Epstein for essentially running a child sex trafficking ring for years and years.</p><p>All of our correspondents on this story are with us. But let me begin with Kaitlan Collins. She joins me on the phone.</p><p>Because, Kaitlan, you know, the president apparently thought that Acosta did a good job defending himself in that press conference on Wednesday. He said this morning this was Acosta's decision to resign. But what is your reporting on what seems to be a change of heart from the President himself?</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Yes, that's right, Poppy. So the President was the one who had the idea for Alex Acosta to come out to defend himself, something he felt that he needed to do on his own from the Labor Department.</p><p>And he had initially been pretty receptive to how that had gone. He noted he had this calm demeanor. He took a lot of questions. It didn't go as poorly as people had thought it could have gone.</p><p>But then there started to be this shift in the President's tone essentially based on what our sources are telling us. That the President started to have his doubts about it. He started talking about victim notification. That was a big part of that plea deal and why Acosta was facing scrutiny because those victims had not been notified about the plea deal, something he spoke about during that press conference. And that was what led people to start to believe that potentially Acosta did not have that much time left in the White House.</p><p>The President also has said nothing publicly about it, which was another cause for concern for people at the West Wing who were worried about potentially the Labor Secretary having to be forced out of his job.</p><p>Well, the President made clear this morning, he said that that was based on Acosta's decision, that he didn't want to be the focus, but certainly he did not feel that he had the support of the President based on the conversations that the President had been having over the last 24 hours or so.</p><p>HARLOW: Kaitlan Collins, thank you very much. Stand by. Let us know if you have more reporting. Nia-Malika, let me go to you.</p><p>I think it's interesting that, according to Kaitlan's reporting, the President's turn here was about the lack of the victims being notified. And let me remind people, it's a Federal judge that has ruled that what Acosta agreed to here, to basically keep this deal secret from all of the victims, the dozens of victims, over 30 victims that we know about, was not only illegal, that's what a Federal judge said.</p><p>The great reporting from Julie Brown in \"The Miami Herald\" earlier this year pointed out that Acosta actually acquiesced to Epstein's lawyers over and over again after having this secret meeting with them, agreeing to keep things private, also helped them limit the scandal by shutting out the victims, moving some of this to Miami to keep it out of, quote, \"significant press coverage,\" away from many of the victims in the Palm Beach area?</p><p>NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER: That's right. And he tried to offer an explanation in that press conference, but, you know, when the reporters from \"The Miami Herald\" sort of fact checked it, it came up to be false. He was, you know, in many ways, he was sort of full of excuses and misdirection.</p><p>In that press conference, I thought he was terrible, terrible, terrible. In that press conference, he seemed smug. He seemed self-satisfied. There was a glibness about him. He portrayed himself as sort of the hero in this story who rescued this case from the folks in the State of Florida who weren't going to go further and really be harsh on this guy, Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>So, yes, I mean, it's not a surprise. I mean it sort of sounds like the President, once he listened carefully to the press conference, that he saw I think what I saw initially, which was a poor, poor performance by Acosta.</p><p>[10:00:10]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071201cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJM-6BC1-JB20-G28F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9080\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000984V</classCode><className>ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV NV/SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J45</classCode><className>FORD MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS312120 BREWERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC2082 MALT BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK &amp;

Ford, obviously, I think, at least from our opinion, is progressing well through a transition and actually largely through it at this point. Just finished the ramp of the F-150. There's still some benefits from commercial fleet this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the road to launching another incredibly important product in the product portfolio, the Super Duty, late this year and will have, by our estimates, a ton of new launches over the next few years, which really is key to the story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Along with this product success, there's been great execution, really stellar. It has positioned the Company in a great way on its balance sheet. It's allowing Ford to not just institute and raise its common dividend, but also to put a supplemental dividend in place of $1 billion this year and I think we will probably see more in the coming years. That's by our estimates, not necessarily Ford's at this point.</p><p>But I think there's some great color we're going to get from Bob Shanks today, who is the Executive Vice President and CFO. He also oversees the global data and analytics team I think, which is a very interesting role in addition to his CFO position. And he has been at Ford I think -- we were just talking -- 39 years, which I believe means that Bob probably started when he was about three years old, given how great he looks.</p><p>We really appreciate, Bob, you coming today. I will turn it over to you for a couple of opening remarks and then we will get into the Q&amp;A session.</p><p>BOB SHANKS, EVP &amp; CFO, FORD MOTOR COMPANY: Okay, thanks, and thanks for having us at the conference today. I thought what I'd do is I'd just make a few brief comments about where we see ourselves right now and then what we will do is we will just leave the balance of the time, most of the time for just Q's and A's. Is that all right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's perfect.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Okay. So just to put into context this year, we are coming off of six years starting in 2010, and really kind of started in 2009 even as we were coming out of the Great Recession, of really, really strong results. We've been doing $8 billion to $10 billion of pretax profit at a company level each year.</p><p>We have had very strong cash flow and it kind of was capped last year post the F-150 launch, because 2014 was quite affected by that really unprecedented launch for us with a record company profit. We had probably the highest level of automotive cash flow that we have ever had, but we say since 2001 because that's when we started calculating it the way we do now. But I think if you go back, it had to be the best year of cash flow we've ever had.</p><p>We had our best operating margins since at least the 1990s. We saw a big improvement in our risk profile. We got all parts of Ford, other than South America, profitable for the first time since I think 2010-ish, so that was a great accomplishment for us. Particularly for the European team, because they finally got back to profitability, and it was in line with what we expected when we launched the European transformation plan back in 2012.</p><p>We had targeted 2015 for profit and they actually delivered that. The thing that's kind of interesting about that it was done despite the fact that Russia, of course, subsequent to 2012 when we developed the plan, went into a very deep recession driven by the commodity cycle and public sanctions on top of that. So we felt very good about that.</p><p>And when we think about where the Company is as we go into 2016, this year, we expect basically the business to do as well as, if not better, across almost all parts of the business than we did in 2015. So we are looking for another strong year, so a seventh year of very strong results by Ford.</p><p>In terms of -- just a brief comment about the external environment. I think you had IHS on prior to us, right? We're looking at this year as being a year of relatively moderate growth on a global basis. We do think that conditions are supportive of continued growth in the global industry volume. It's going to be different, obviously, by region and by market, but we still see a little bit of growth.</p><p>We see the US continuing to grow modestly in terms of GDP and we see 17.5 million to 18.5 million unit industry. We include medium and heavy in that.</p><p>We are seeing very strong growth in Europe in terms of industry; probably at the high end, if not a bit above, the range that we provided, which was about 18 million to 20 million units. So that's looking very, very healthy.</p><p>China started off very strongly. A little hard to tell in the first two months because of the impact of the Chinese New Year, but it looks really, really good.</p><p>Pricing there is starting to stabilize. We still expect it to be negative year over year, but certainly we are starting to see pricing stabilize if we looked at it on a sequential basis, which is a good sign.</p><p>I think the big issue that we have, and probably everyone has, in terms of regions is South America. The recession there probably is going to be even worse than what we had thought. I think the GDP, the decline in GDP will probably be greater than what we guided to, although interestingly we don't see the industry moving in line with that. It's still very low, but it still seems to be within the range that we had projected.</p><p>So I think everything is shaping up so far -- still early in the year -- to be the kind of year that we guided to. So we feel pretty good about where we are. Always lots of work to do and certainly working to do even better, but we feel pretty good about where we are right now.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Great. I will kick it off with the first question, and this is sort of a ubiquitous question that we're all focused on, is: where do you think we are in the US cycle? And how do you think Ford is positioned, not just for the downturn?</p><p>You gave us some great metrics yesterday and help in understanding that, but maybe, as an optimist, more importantly if demand runs very hot, how are you going to keep up with potentially some real significant upside in the cycle from where we are right now?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: We see the US economy, as I just mentioned, growing at sort of probably the low 2%s. We've got a range of 2.3%, 2.8%. We think we're probably at the low end of that range. We think the industry is going to be in that range I just mentioned, 17.5 million, 18.5 million, so that seems to be holding up well.</p><p>Pricing is looking good. Our pricing is up more than the industry, but the industry actually is up in terms of transaction prices, although incentives within that are up modestly. But pricing still looks to be healthy.</p><p>It's different by segment. We see cars as being under pressure and that's more, I think, driven by the fact that consumers, for quite some time, have been shifting from cars into utilities. Truck is holding up pretty well. And so I think that's really -- more of what's happening there is more of a consumer demand-driven dynamic than anything else in terms of cars, but the industry still looks quite healthy.</p><p>The leading economic indicators that we look at -- and we look at quite a number, as you might expect us to do -- all look, for the most part, to be supportive of that type of outlook. There's nothing that would suggest that we are imminently ready to go into a recession here in the US, which is what we've been saying for quite a number of months, which I think the market is starting to recognize as well. So things seem to be getting back on track in terms of even a market perception. So I think everything is being set up for the type of year that we had thought it would be in terms of the US.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: If we see the US --</p><p>BOB SHANKS: If it's stronger?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: -- ratchet up to an 18 million and 18.5 million, ramping up to 19 million, how do you respond to that and how do you think the industry responds to it? Because I personally think it's a high-class problem the industry is going to be facing.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Yeah, you would have a high (multiple speakers), yes.</p><p>Well, I really -- again it will depend on (technical difficulty) running our production this year. Probably about 70% of it will be coming from plants that are running on three crews, which means that they are running flat out. And we run those types of operations day in, day out, constantly so that we can make sure that we have the appropriate supply of vehicles in the peak selling season, so the spring, late summer, and end of the year.</p><p>We don't have a lot of room in those plants. There's about 18 weekends where you can run overtime, but that's about it. Otherwise, you get what you get. We do have, obviously, some open capacity in other parts of our system, but they tend to be in the segments that are under pressure, which is the cars that I mentioned.</p><p>I think we will be very careful in terms of any further capacity actions, at least, for example, in trucks. I think where we are is fine. I'd be concerned about adding more capacity of any substance at this point in time.</p><p>We know that some of our competition are also going to be adding capacity. I think FCA is planning to shift some of its car capacity into truck capacity, so want to be kind of careful in terms of what the overall competitive dynamic is in that space.</p><p>We have also got the ability; with our One Ford approach to the business that we also have the ability to bring in vehicles, depending upon what the demand is, from other parts of Ford into North America, if that were the case. If there was a sustained level of much higher profitability, I think -- or volume, I think we would have to go back and look at that. But I think where we are we would probably just look at pricing opportunities or mix opportunities, things of that sort.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And just on mix, when we see this phenomenon of cars shifting to crossovers, partially it seems like it's gas price, but partially it seems it's like a structural shift that's going on.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Yes, it's demand driven.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: As you look at your capacity right now, is there opportunity to move some of this car capacity over to crossovers? And do you think crossovers, as everybody is kind of making some of that shift, will remain much more profitable than cars and this may solve some of the industry's issues on the car profit side?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: I think we have that opportunity and we probably would do what we've already done on sort of an organic basis when we have normal model changes or even when we add a vehicle line to the lineup. And we've talked about adding four SUVs over the next several years to the lineup. I think we will probably make those choices in terms of what's built where on sort of an organic basis and I think you probably will see some shifting of capacity from cars into SUVs to some extent.</p><p>But we will do that sort of organically as those changes naturally occur.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. And then the other hot topic that we get, and we will maybe get some follow-up questions on, this is on auto credit and how overheated do you believe it is. Is this stuff that we are seeing on the fringes, in the subprime market, new? Is it just on the fringes? Is it something that you think is problematic for the industry?</p><p>And how is Ford Credit operating and how do you see the cost of funds for Ford Credit? Has it ratcheted up and are you seeing some pressure in the credit market on a cost basis, not necessarily on a crisis basis, if we're looking forward?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Let me just talk from Ford's perspective and Ford Credit, not the industry. Ford Credit has been following very consistent underwriting policies for a long, long, long, long time. We haven't really changed.</p><p>So if you look at the portfolio of the business in Ford Credit, about 5% to 6% is what we call high risk. That is not necessarily subprime, because we actually have a proprietary way of assessing customer risk. So that has been constant; it's still 5% to 6%.</p><p>What we have seen is a continued shift -- and this has been something that has been happening for many, many years, not just recently -- to longer and longer terms. We've also seen more and more leasing in the industry. We're kind of under indexed in both of those instances, but our portfolio also is getting longer and longer and leasing has been going up, but again less than what the industry has been.</p><p>But again, we do all of that with these very, very consistent practices that we follow in terms of who we lend to and how we assess the risk. And so if you look at the portfolio and the robustness of the portfolio, it's very, very strong.</p><p>What we are seeing in the credit markets is I think credit is widely available. We have seen spreads increase, particularly given the overall volatility that we saw early in the year. I think they are coming in a little bit recently and certainly the upgrade that Ford got from S&amp;P and Moody's has helped already.</p><p>So I don't think we see any constraints in terms of supporting the continued growth of Ford Credit as that supports the overall growth of Ford. I think everything looks good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: When you think about Ford Credit, it's a big player in supporting the business in North America. It's a smaller player in Europe and a smaller player in China. Is there the potential opportunity to globalize Ford Motor Credit?</p><p>If you can just sort of talk about really what the support is in aggregate in the business and how important a role it is for the ongoing business and stability of earnings and cash flow going forward.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Actually, Ford Credit does support Ford around the world. Now we do it in different ways; it kind of depends upon local conditions and does it make sense or not for Ford Credit itself to go in?</p><p>Sometimes we will do it with joint ventures. Sometimes we will do it with partners, but we're behind the scenes in terms of supporting that partner who may be, if you will, providing the direct support to the network or to customers.</p><p>We follow different models and we've got a specific approach that we will take depending upon conditions in each market in terms of what way we will go to market in that manner. In Europe actually, Ford Credit does provide a great deal of support, both on the wholesale side and on the retail side. It's more like North America than any other part of the world.</p><p>In Brazil, I think we work in partnership with local banks. In Russia, we work with local banks as well.</p><p>And China we are wholly-owned and supported there, although in China itself overall financing is much lower. It's just a market condition, which I think will change over time as consumers become more and more comfortable with taking on financing to purchase vehicles. But I think we've got a good position there.</p><p>The good news, I think, in China is that the regulators, the People's Bank of China, has been working very aggressively I think to continue to open up the capital markets there and make them more normal, if you will. And so we're continuing to see more and more opportunities to get local financing for the credit operations, which is great.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Europe has been a really great turnaround. It's I guess the third consecutive profitable quarter. I know it's been a hard-earned success. If you could help explain what some of those milestones were and what some of the game plan was that you actually achieved and then give us a feeling of how sturdy that recovery in that business is going forward.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: And maybe a comment about what we're seeing so far this year as well.</p><p>If you go back to 2012, when we announced the European transformation plan, we said it was around three things. It was brand, working on the brand, because we do, at least versus some of our European competitors had sort of a brand discount in the way that we look at it. So it was working on the brand, working on product, and working on cost.</p><p>If you now look at what we've actually accomplished versus where we were in 2012, we have largely delivered on what we expected and in some ways we've done a bit better. And I will explain that.</p><p>If you look at that, we've done very well on volume and mix. Share is actually flat over that period of time. We've gotten favorable pricing and that is around all the work that the team did on brand and on product.</p><p>If you look at cost, I think we actually have done better on cost than what we had expected. We've had a bit of an increase in what we call structural cost, which was expected. If you look at the contribution costs, think of that as sort of variable costs, we actually have had a lot of good news and that is through I think the team doing more than what had been expected. We also benefited from the commodity cycle turning, so we picked up about $400 million from that.</p><p>The thing that we have overcome; in our original plan we had actually expected Russia to be a much bigger and positive contributor to the turnaround because of the investments that we were making there. And our expectation that the Russian market probably by about now would be, if not the largest in Europe, among the largest.</p><p>And of course, the commodity cycle turned. It's largely a gas, oil-driven economy; sanctions on top of that, so it's in a very deep recession. The industry fell sharply and is still at sort of a 1.5 million level and so, of course, we have losses there. We've been able to accomplish a return to profitability, despite Russia actually going in the opposite direction.</p><p>And we see actually, as you go forward, we're targeting a 6% to 8% return for our operations in Europe, including Russia, and we do think that eventually the cycle will turn on commodities. It will benefit Russia; that will be a positive contributor at some point in the future.</p><p>But so far this year we're seeing a really good start to the year for the operations in Europe. The team is continuing to focus on even making further improvements to our product lineup, really focusing on what customers really want and value. Walking away from products that we think are no longer relevant, if you will, in the future in Europe.</p><p>Doing a great job on costs, pushing even further on costs. We've announced a voluntary separation program across Europe that probably will give us about a $200 million ongoing cost save versus where we were last year. And so we're not letting up at all.</p><p>And the industry, as I mentioned, looks like it's actually going to be a bit of a tailwind this year for us. It's coming on very, very strong, other than Russia.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thank you, that's helpful.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: So it's really -- Russia I think is a really good story and will be a highlight for us this year.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's awesome, thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe, if you could just quickly before we open up for Q&amp;A, talk about South America. Obviously it's a smaller piece of the pie, but with a big cost-cutting (multiple speakers).</p><p>BOB SHANKS: With big numbers, though.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I know, but -- well, yes, yes. I mean, yes; big numbers and profits are small or losses are hopefully getting smaller. But the $450 million that you saved last year in cost savings, which you showed and broke out very specifically yesterday, was wildly helpful and actually wildly impressive to do in the space of the year.</p><p>How much more of that do you see as an opportunity going forward to cut costs in response to a market that, based on IHS and I think a lot of our expectations, is going to continue to be very weak? Do you get that region back to breakeven in the next two or three years, even if we're still kind of chugging along at these very low levels because you are doing great cost cutting and great product launches?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: I think the team has done a really good job and that's why we wanted to show that particular slide that we did yesterday at the Let's Chat event. I think the team has done a really, really good job of responding to the crisis, if you will, that we have in the region.</p><p>It is entirely externally driven. It's an economic downturn driven by the commodity cycle, but it's also overlaid I think by all the political issues that we see in Brazil and read about every day.</p><p>Frankly, the turnaround is going to require the cycle to turn and I think resolution, to some extent, of the political crisis that we see. Because for Brazil to unleash its potential is really going to require some structural changes to the economy, which are going to take a government that has got the ability and the will do that. So I think it's dependent, in part, on that.</p><p>So I would say the turnaround of our business there is likely in probably the medium term. I don't think this is going to happen in the next year or two, but we do think the commodity cycle is likely to start to turn next year globally. And I think that will help, but I think the political resolution in terms of the fiscal and structural things that have to be done to the economy in Brazil is going to be an important factor in terms of how strong that turnaround happens to be.</p><p>So our team is still working on further things that we can do. We actually mentioned yesterday that we will be taking another shift, the third shift off at our big Camacari facility in Northeast Brazil, so that obviously is going to help. And we are going to continue to work on other things we can do.</p><p>We've actually challenged the team to think about what we're going through, as we did in North America back in 2008-2009, as an opportunity, as a crisis. What more can we do, even beyond the normal cost cutting, to restructure the business so that when things externally do start to turn that we can come out of it far stronger than we were than when we went into it. So that's work ahead of us, but I think team has got the charge to be creative and it will be interesting to see what they come back with.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: We can open it up for questions, if we've got any in the audience. I've got a bunch more.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to focus on the comment you made on the call yesterday about the lease returns and the impact to Ford Credit from residual pricing.</p><p>Just wondering, the comment about the less than $100 million impact, is that based on current auction values or are we assuming further declines in auction values for the rest of the year? And I guess just stepping back, how quickly can Ford Credit respond by raising lease prices, monthly prices to offset the loss of some of the residual-related income?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: It's interesting what's been going on in the auction market and with residuals. Let's just talk about what normally happens.</p><p>Normally this time of year you start to see a seasonal increase in auction prices. Until very recently we didn't see that. They didn't go down, but they just didn't go up to the extent that they normally should.</p><p>Actually, in the last month or so, after I think we ended February, we started to see an increase in auction values. Still not back to the level that you would normally expect to see at this point in time, but nonetheless they actually are now increasing. In the aggregate; it's different by segment.</p><p>So one of the things that, at least from an internal perspective, we're looking at versus our plan and what we had expected, auction values are a bit of a drag on the Ford Credit business, which is what I talked about yesterday. We are working to contain that, but it is a bit of a drag on the business versus our expectations, for the reasons I mentioned.</p><p>When you look at what's happening on a year-over-year basis, on a year-over-year basis trucks were actually up so auction prices for trucks are up. In terms of utilities, flat to a bit down and, for us, that's really driven by the Escape.</p><p>We launched the new Escape, or what was then the new Escape, in the 2013 model. We, unfortunately, had quite a number of recalls on that model, if you remember back those days, and so we are really paying for that now as the vehicles come back into the marketplace. It's really a very specific, focused issue for us around the Escape.</p><p>Cars is a different issue. I think this is more of an industry issue. We are seeing the auction values of cars decline and pretty sharply. Again, I think this is going back to what I said earlier around the whole consumer demand shift from cars into utilities and that's playing out now in the auction place.</p><p>One of the things that is encouraging, if we look at our no-sale rates -- again, I'm just talking Ford -- the no-sale rates have been throughout all of this very, very normal. And in fact, recently I think they have even been strengthening. Just looking at last week's auction values, they were up several hundred dollars.</p><p>So I think things appear to be a little healthier than what we thought when we looked to January and February, but I think if you --. As I mentioned yesterday, when you see our results for the first quarter, our expectation is that when you look at Ford Credit's results, which I think will be quite good in the aggregate -- but within that on the year-over-year basis you will see headwinds from auction values not being what we had expected and certainly this year-over-year issue that I mentioned largely around the cars. And it will be less than $100 million in terms of that impact.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Just on that real quick, when you talk about pricing coming down that means -- how does that run through the P&amp;L for Ford Motor Credit? That ultimately means that your depreciation expense goes up as the expectation for vehicle prices goes down?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Well, there is two aspects. In fact, I think you asked that; I maybe didn't complete the answer or forgot it.</p><p>So there's two things that are going on. First of all, you've got vehicles actually coming back and going through auction. And so how does that compare versus the expectation? That's really what I was talking to more so.</p><p>The other thing that's going on is we basically, largely use ALG in terms of setting the lease-end value expectation for contracts that we are in the process of concluding. What we have seen is that the phenomenon I just mentioned around cars in particular, that those values are lower and so as a result, on a go-forward basis, at least versus our expectations, those are less than what we had expected. And so that's another phenomenon that you will see in the results as we move forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: That would be an ongoing increase in depreciation if used vehicle prices came down in total? It wouldn't be a one-time big bang hit thing (multiple speakers)?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Yes, we kind of makeup that difference, if you will, over the -- along the way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Sorry, I was just going to ask: GM made a big purchase of a software company just a couple weeks ago and I'm just curious how you think about your spending levels organically versus inorganically, fixed assets versus software. Because that seemed to be a big price paid for a three-year-old company.</p><p>Obviously, they're buying talent. The purchase price is maybe for some unique software that doesn't exist internally at GM or very much outside of GM. I'm just kind of curious how you, as Ford, think about that, because you guys are investing heavily in your business. But obviously over time, if more value is accreting to the software side, will you be shifting some of your investments more to software as opposed to fixed assets?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: That's a great question and actually for quite some time now we've been talking about the business in sort of two ways. We talk about the core business, which is the business you're all very familiar with, which is the business that is generating all the profitability, all the cash for us to invest in going forward, however we choose to do that.</p><p>And then what we see is a lot -- this is not just us, I think this is the industry. This is also some of the larger non-OEM tech firms; they see the same opportunities, but coming from sort of the other end of the spectrum around how you take new technology, connectivity, and think about the vehicle as a new big thing on the Internet of Things.</p><p>How do you take the ability to connect to the customer in the 900-plus hours that they spend every year in a vehicle, how do you take that, all of that together in a way and monetize it and develop a relationship with the consumer as they use that product in their day-to-day lives?</p><p>And so what you have is all of us trying to figure this out. I don't think anybody has yet; this is still a lot of work in front of us, but clearly it's going to require a lot more of a software-type focus and solution than hardware.</p><p>We do a lot of software today inside Ford, calibrations and all the electronics that are in the vehicle, but I think it's true and a fair statement that going forward, to fully leverage the opportunities that we see in what we call the space of Ford Smart Mobility, it will require different solutions, different expertise, partnerships. We will have to make some investments.</p><p>It's just going to be a whole new space that we believe -- and I think everyone has the same point of view. It's just who's going to get there and how are they going to do it and what's the combination of places that they are going to invest in specifically to create new business opportunities and new business models in that space to combine with the core business to create, in our point of view, a bigger and stronger business?</p><p>So I think you've seen GM do that; you've seen Toyota do that. You're going to see us do things. But what we will want to do as we go forward -- and we're not there yet, frankly -- but we will want to explain how we see the space, where we're going to place our bets.</p><p>And as we do make these investments, particularly if they are material, we will want to explain why we've done it, how does it fit in; how does it move us forward, if you will, in terms of driving and delivering value so that the investors understand the context in which the investment is made. And we commit to you that we will do that.</p><p>But this is a space that is going to be rapidly evolving and you're going to see it across a number of OEMs. And I do think you will see -- and we know that from at least the rumors around Apple, the rumors around Google and so forth. You've got these big tech firms who are starting from the software side. They have to go the other direction in terms of how they try to leverage and capitalize on this opportunity.</p><p>We're all seeing the same thing; we're just coming from different directions and working in different ways that will be unique by company to leverage that opportunity. That's a lot of work ahead of us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: You did an excellent job improving the profitability of the business and the return on you getting capital investment, and yet the equity markets were obviously still tough on you and others. There's some voices, one particularly loud voice, that speaks about the need to consolidate the industry.</p><p>Do you see opportunities to get step-function improvements in capital investments to generate free cash flow, either through scale, either combining companies, or coordinated development of engine technology and transmissions and all the other things that are very costly to develop?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: I don't actually -- let me come at it from a different direction. I do think going forward that we, in particular, we will look for more opportunities in the parts of the business that probably the customer doesn't care that much about in terms of whether we did it all ourselves or did we do it with other people.</p><p>I think that there will be opportunities for us to partner. We are doing that already; for example, in Europe on diesel engines we partner with PSA on that. Here in North America on both the 6-speed transmissions, automatic transmissions, and now these new 9- and 10-speed transmissions that will be coming, we are developing those jointly with General Motors. We then both build on our own, because the scale that each of us has is so large it just makes sense to do that.</p><p>But I think you'll see more and more efforts underway, probably across the industry, but including at Ford, to partner and to join with others in various aspects of the business where the customers don't really care. And I think that we can probably get better capital utilization by doing that and better scale by doing that.</p><p>I think you will also see -- I don't think you will see -- I'd be surprised if you saw successful consolidations, if you will. Because one of the things that we have learned, particularly as we have developed the One Ford plan and basically merged ourselves, is there is a certain level of benefit that you get at sort of the global level; you put all those units together. It's largely around engineering, frankly.</p><p>And so us going from 27 platforms down to nine and we're working to get to eight, we've seen tremendous opportunities and efficiencies from the engineering side. But when you get down to actually then building that vehicle, you build it in a plant and a site, the scale is really at that site level and with the suppliers around you, which can be 50,000 units or 100,000 or 300,000, based on whatever is the economic scale of a particular commodity or a different part. It's not 7 million units, it's at that level.</p><p>So if you were to take two big enterprises and mash them together, I think you have to keep that in mind. You may over time, and it would be a lot of hard work -- I can tell you from us doing it ourselves, a lot of hard work to get the scale advantages that are available at that global level. But the real -- the pedal meets the road when you get down to that site level and that's just a lot of hard work and leveraging the local supply base and so forth. It's not at that big, massive put-it-all-together level; that's not where it happens.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I have a quick balance sheet question, if it's all right. We have a lot of fixed-income investors here, so the balance sheet has really been extraordinarily strong.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Did I tell you we got upgraded recently?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes, I saw that. You [read] about 1 turn of gross leverage, which is really great, and over time Ford has in the past talked about increasing their rating as a long-term competitive advantage in a cyclical industry. Can you just touch on that really quickly?</p><p>BOB SHANKS: In terms of how we think about that or --? I think we are cyclical. We've been through downturns and I think none of us will ever forget what happened in 2008 and 2009. Of course, we started a big restructuring of North America before that, so we had a number of years that were extremely difficult.</p><p>It was difficult back then to fund Ford Credit, for example. So we know -- we feel viscerally, know what it's like to be in a position where the balance sheet is not strong and what happens when a cycle turns and you're not positioned well. Particularly having the credit company, but not just the credit company.</p><p>Since then we have really worked hard to make sure that we've got a very, very strong balance sheet and we are absolutely committed to keeping a very strong balance sheet. That's also one of the key reasons why over the last six years at least we have had a very committed strategy to fully fund and derisk our global-funded pension plans, because that was one of the bigger issues that we were facing. Because what happens when interest rates go the wrong direction or asset returns don't work out? You could be forced to make capital contributions just at the time where you don't have the capital to do that.</p><p>We're almost there. This year we are going to invest $1.5 billion into our global-funded plans, and once we do that, those plans in the aggregate will be fully funded. We're done. And then going forward, all we have to worry about are basically the ongoing service costs, which should be $500 million, $600 million, $700 million a year, and that's that.</p><p>That really is an important part of strengthening our balance sheet and I think it's one of the key elements that influenced the rating agencies in terms of giving us this next move up, along with the fact that we are starting to see better performance in the operations outside North America.</p><p>So we are absolutely committed to keep the balance sheet strong and to make sure that Ford Credit itself remains strong, because that's a really critical aspect that we see in the support of the automotive business around the world, going back to the earlier conversation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe just one quick follow-up. When you look the assets and liabilities in the pension, to get into esoteric discussion on pensions, they are largely at this point duration-matched, so interest rate moves will have a relatively similar impact on the liability --</p><p>BOB SHANKS: That is the whole strategy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: -- and the assets. So once you are fully funded, presumably -- there can always be shocks in assets, but that is a fairly locked and loaded position.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: And as part of that, as we progressively have gotten more funded, we have been increasing progressively the percent of the assets that are in fixed income investments, but we're targeting 80% for the most part. We still want to have 20% in equities, alternative investments because we still would like to get a little bit of a higher return than what we'll get on the fixed income side, because that will be largely matched.</p><p>And I think you saw that in terms of what happened with the overall funded status of the plan this last year. There was a lot of bad news, if you will, both in terms of asset returns but also the interest rates didn't really move as much as what we had expected and we end up improving the funded status overall. The US actually got worse, but it was offset by the funds outside, so it all works.</p><p>It's never going to be perfect. It will always probably be a little good, a little bad, but it's just not going to be the big risk that it was if you go back to 2005-2006 and the very unfunded status that we had at the time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: That's great. I think with that we have to wrap up; we are out of time. We really appreciate you coming, Bob, and good luck with the rest of the day.</p><p>BOB SHANKS: Thank you, it's great to be here.

Brinkman</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Presentation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RYAN J. BRINKMAN, SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Okay. I thank you for joining us today. Very happy to have Ford Motor Companyat this conference for the first time and happy to have Hau Thai-Tang here. Hau, thanks for coming. Hau is the Executive Vice President of Product Development and Purchasing for Ford Motor Company. He has, I was just mentioning, almost precisely the same title as the next speaker from General Motors. It'd be nice to compare their responses. Welcome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I think maybe just to begin, you've spent 25 years in various roles, often in product development, right? And given that perspective, I was just curious, from an overarching perspective, if you could share a little bit about how the auto industry has evolved over that period of time in terms of its focus on technology, like how would you rate the pace of innovation today, for example, compared to prior periods, et cetera?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Thanks, Ryan. Thanks for having us, and thanks, everybody, for your interest in Ford. As Ryan mentioned, I'm approaching 30 years with Ford. I spent the first 25 in product development, the last 4 in purchasing, and now I have a chance to work with both teams. And the rate of innovation is just really astounding right now and it's more than just the pace of innovation. I think you have this confluence of changing consumer behaviors, a lot of that fueled by millennials and younger buyers but also by technology, and the smart car being a great example. You have this convergence of advances in technologies, connectivity, autonomy, electrification. And all of these things are really profound changes that can kind of -- a pretty dramatic impact on how we think about not only the design of the vehicles in terms of the architecture, but the value creation and how we're going to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace, and then on top of that, you've got business model innovation. So the combination of all those things together is creating this disruptive force, and it's something that's really unprecedented in the 115-year history of Ford Motor Company.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Thanks for that overview. I'm just curious the different roles that you do have, at product development and purchasing. Can you talk about how these roles, seemingly different, actually might be sort of hand in hand and how that can drive improvements in the product and cost?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. This is clearly one of the, I think, motivations behind combining the 2 organizations under 1 leader, with <person><nameText>Jim Hackett </nameText></person>coming onboard, as we really see -- historically, this is something our suppliers have cited that Ford has done very well, having this -- we refer to it as a matched pair concept, where we have write-downs at the engineer-buyer level, all the way up through the senior executives, a matched pair between product development and purchasing. Now having them under 1 organization is just going to accelerate this. And it gives us a chance to think about commodity segmentation, how we want to determine which parts are core to Ford that we should do ourselves in-house, both the design and, in some cases, the manufacturing, to what should we leverage our supplier partners for and how do we want to engage them and at what point in time. And if we can do that well, we'll not only deliver more technology and innovation to the marketplace, but do it at much greater value for the customers.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: What does that decision-making framework look like, in terms of do you develop a capability in-house versus you try to outsource it from suppliers?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. We -- just like most things, we start with a customer point of view, and we try to think about how does the customers see value in that particular commodity, system, technology and is it going to be brand differentiating for Ford going forward. And I think this is something that's going to change very dramatically. It is changing very dramatically in the marketplace. Some of the things that historically had been brand differentiating I don't think will be going forward in a world that's increasingly more connected, autonomous and electrified. So we start with that point of view, and then we think about what's the value-add that Ford can bring? Is it a good use of capital? Is it a good use of engineering resources? And then if the answer to those questions are yes, then those are things that we would potentially do ourselves and vertically integrate, and if the answer is no, then we would most likely look to partner or to leverage our supplier partners to do that.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: The investors here who participated in the last presentation heard a lot about connected cars. Aptiv was the speaker there. And I'm just curious how the increasingly connected nature of cars might affect your job in terms of product development.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: It's completely changed the way we think about the product. Once the vehicles become connected to the Internet of Things, it's a completely different ball game in terms of value creation, services that we can provide, how the customers think about the products, the ability -- we started seeing this maybe a decade ago, when people started bringing nomadic devices, their own phones, tablets into the vehicles. But now, having vehicles with modems and then having them connected and being able to communicate to the vehicles even when the driver is not in the car is game-changing. So this is something that is a huge part of our focus in terms of smart vehicles in a smart world. It's a big part of how we want to differentiate Ford going forward, and it's requiring us to really think about the entire vehicle differently in terms of the electrical architecture. So I'll give you an example. Almost every single Ford and Lincoln vehicle in the U.S. comes with a garage door opener. We also have GPS in all of our cars. So you should be able to geofence it and have it recognized when it's pulling up to your driveway and automatically open the garage door. All of those -- a lot of garage door openers now are smart devices that are connected. But to do that, you have to rewire the electrical architecture of the vehicle to get those stand-alone devices to talk to each other, and so that's something we would partner with a company like Aptiv to do, yes.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: And I'm curious, too, in your focus on product development, you've come up with some really strong years, record and near-record years for light vehicle sales in the U.S. It's been a very significant trend there, right, where the passenger car segment of those sales has been really declining while the crossovers and the trucks have been increasing. I'm just curious what your thoughts are in terms of the future of passenger cars in the U.S. and what that means in terms of ability to profit and how much resources you allocate toward that effort.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. So I wouldn't want to generalize because one of our learnings from -- as we transition beyond ONE Ford is not to just think about all segments and markets as being homogeneous. We have some passenger cars that do really well, that are very -- that are profitable. Mustang is a great example. And I think in the luxury segment, some of those passenger vehicles also can be very profitable and differentiated. But there are segments, primarily B, C, C, D in the U.S. market, that are becoming commoditized. People in those market in -- shopping in those segments are looking for low total cost of ownership, reliability, resale value, and those are things that maybe are not historical strengths and hallmarks of Ford. So as we go through and look at our business of where we compete, where we allocate capital, where do we allocate engineering resources, we consider all of those things. The shift that you've highlighted of going into crossovers and utility vehicles, we think, is a secular shift. We don't see this as a trend. And I think people -- once they make the move, they like the higher command driving position, the greater visibility, the sense of confidence, the utility of those vehicles, and the vehicles are getting increasingly better for fuel efficiency because of the pace of -- the regulatory requirements are outpacing the cost of fuel. That customers, I don't think, will go back even if the price of gas goes up. So we see this as a secular shift, but I don't want to generalize across all markets and all segments.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Yes. Pivoting then, though, from cars to trucks, which are a historical hallmark and strength of Ford Motor Company. I think there's going to be some new competition in 2018 with maybe a new Ram, maybe a new Silverado and Sierra. I just -- can you talk about what you're doing to keep the F-Series, the best-selling vehicle, fresh and competitive amidst that increased competition?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. We -- it's a very competitive business that we're in, and that segment, in particular, is increasingly more competitive as you've highlighted, Ryan. I think what we've done really well and why we've been the best-selling vehicle and the best-selling truck for over 40 years is we understand those customers very well. We don't rest on our laurels. So as you guys all know, we did a major change, architectural change in 2015. And then 3 years later, we followed up with a very significant freshening, all-new powertrain lineup. We just launched this year -- or we just announced that we're going to launch a diesel engine into the F-150, and all of those things are geared to deliver to those truck customers what they want, which is not only improved fuel efficiency, but more capability, more towing, more payload, things that they value and they want to pay for. It's funny that you bring this up because immediately after Jim's keynote this morning, I had the honor to accept one of the Edmunds CES innovation awards. F-150 was named the Most Innovative Truck of CES, and this is coming off earlier this year where it was named Motor Trend Truck of the Year. So it just shows you that we're not resting on our laurels, and we're committing to continue to invest in that product to keep it ahead.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I think I saw a headline the other day saying that the diesel in the F-150 might break like 30 miles per gallon, so like the 4-minute mile for pickup trucks. Is that possible?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Thirty-mile per gallon on a highway, yes. That's a really significant milestone. It's also based on the SAE calculations. It's going to deliver Best-in-class Towing and Payload as well.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Speaking of powertrains, I think an important or an interesting question is, what is the most advantageous type of power train for autonomous vehicles? GM has been pretty adamant recently that all AVs must be EVs, but Delphi and some others have said that maybe plug-in hybrid would lend itself better because you wouldn't have to take vehicles out of service. So utilization could be greater. I'm just curious -- and then also, is there a power draw or a range draw from all of the technologies that facilitate autonomous? Where does -- what's Ford's current thinking in terms of this debate?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. I think the answer to this question really depends on the time horizon of which you're talking about. Are you talking about 10 years from now, 20 years from now or 3 or 4 years from now? I think we -- when we talk about, I'll call it, the near-term horizon, when these vehicles start to launch, they will be very expensive vehicles, these autonomous vehicles. We're talking LiDAR systems that are in the tens of thousands of dollars. Now we know with technology and scale, the cost will come down. But I think we can all fairly say that the first generation of autonomous vehicles are going to be very expensive assets. If you have an expensive asset, if it's not being utilized, you're not making money. So that's a very simplistic way to look at it. And for us, offering our customers the ability to have maximized uptime is going to be very key. That's why we think a hybrid solution is the ideal solution. The power draw consumptions of the sensors and the computational hardware in the vehicles, if you look at most companies and all of the leading companies, they'll tell you it's somewhere between 3- to 4-kilowatt hour -- kilowatt per hour. So on a 20-hour cycle, that's 60 kilowatts. That's the range of most electric vehicles. So we don't think, in the near term, that, that complete BEV vehicle is going to give you the utilization that will deliver the cost of ownership that those customers will demand. Now you can argue that you [won't] get advances in computational powers. The sensors will demand less current draw. All those things are absolutely true, but you have -- as technologists, as development engineers, you have to work with the current state sensor suites to develop the systems. So we can talk about, and if common, what's going to happen 10 or 20 years from now. But in the near term, we don't think a BEV will deliver the best solution for those customers.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I see. And not long ago, speaking of BEVs, you announced a partnership with a domestic Chinese automaker. I believe it's pronounced Zotye.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Zotye.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: A couple of different pronunciations. Can you talk a little bit about the motivations behind that partnership, what it says about your strategy to grow in China, what kind of powertrain types might be in that country? And it's also no secret that automakers have struggled to make a profit on electric vehicles, right? How might this partnership help along those lines?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. I think all of those things are key considerations. First, we have to recognize that the markets are differentiated because of the regulatory environment, the cost of fuel and the consumer behavior. Certainly, China, there's a very strong push from the government to drive new energy vehicles. Clearly, part of that push is to drive localization of the entire value chain, so not only the vehicles themselves, but also the battery manufacturing, the raw materials, the supply chain. And we look at where the growth is happening and where the incentives are being offered, both on the demand side as well as the supply side. The sweet spot is really going to be in the B and C segment at lower cost, and that's typically not an area where the global western OEMs have done a very strong job of. So we're still going to go to market with Ford and Lincoln electrified vehicles in China. But to get the level of penetration and scale that we need, we need a local partner that has the expertise, the value chain, the supply base that's localized that can compete in that high volume, lower revenue price band. So we've been delighted. It's great learning for us as well in terms of how can we increase our cost competitiveness in China, not just for battery electric vehicles but across the entire portfolio. And it gives us a chance to partner and build local scale, develop new indigenous suppliers and find solutions that are better suited for those local Chinese customers.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I think around the same time as you announced that partnership, there was also something in the works with Mahindra, is that right? What were you trying to gain from that relationship in terms of development of vehicles?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. We've announced a memorandum of understanding with Mahindra in India just to explore ways for us to both improve our business in India. India is -- while it's a big market with tremendous growth opportunities, it is a market that is very tough on costs, very low revenue. And for us to compete there, we really need to understand the Indian customer requirements better. Mahindra is somebody who's been very successful in that market. Their product portfolio, I think, potentially complement ours very well, and we can help them in areas, such as electrification and some powertrain technology, as the regulatory environment changes. So it's something that we're having a lot of fruitful dialogue on, yes.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Okay. And you talked before about sort of the question of whether AVs must be EVs. But independent of that, must AVs be connected cars? It seems like 5 years ago at CES, all anyone wanted to talk about relative to the (inaudible) was connectivity, and now it's more autonomous. But I was just curious looking in product development to the extent to which you see these 2 trends as interrelated.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. I don't -- so you may get some debates on whether or not AVs have to be BEVs. So EVs is too general because we are aligned that a hybrid is good solution. But you won't get anybody, I don't think, that will debate whether or not AVs have to be connected. That's mandatory, clearly, for route planning and telematics and all those things. But I think even going beyond that, as we see advances in artificial intelligence, edge computing, how much of that can you now do, how much of that processing can you do off board of the vehicle. And leverage the infrastructure and the cloud, I think, will be a huge enabler to reduce power consumption, drive the cost down and potentially make it compatible with a BEV architecture. So those are all things that I think everybody's aligned on.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: The CEO Strategy Update back in the fall, Ford outlined some really aggressive cost-saving objectives. And it was discussed that the cost savings will build and be much larger in the out-year than initially, and the explanation that was given to that was we want to cut a lot of material cost and it's a lot easier to do that as we entirely develop a vehicle from scratch, some big cost savings targets. It seems like the organization is going to be looking for a lot from you in terms of your ability to reduce material costs and purchasing. Can you just give us some outlines in terms of how you expect to deliver those savings?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Sure, yes. I think, Ryan, what you're referring to is <person><nameText>Jim Hackett </nameText></person>referenced a $14 billion cost opportunity over the planned period versus what we had in our plan. So it's a variance from a plan that we had. $10 billion of the $14 billion is going to come out of material costs, which is basically the cost that goes into every vehicle that we design and purchase, and then the remaining $4 billion would come out of engineering costs. So I feel sorry for the guy that's got to deliver both those things.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: That would be you.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: That would -- that's me. So on material cost, it's really -- it's a couple of things. It's leveraging our understanding that the customers are learning from ONE Ford analytics, now that we have better -- a lot more data coming off the vehicles, understanding what customers use, what features and technologies and then selectively putting in the right content that customers value that they want to pay for is a huge opportunity. This opportunity of PD and purchasing working with the supply base earlier, I think, is another huge opportunity. A big one for me is, we touched on the theme earlier, is rethinking how we're going to differentiate Ford and Lincoln going forward in the future, and in the areas where we no longer think they're going to be differentiated, is how do we stop spending money in those areas. So all of those things are things that we're all looking at. Regulatory costs is a huge part of the cost adds. It was in the original plan. One of the things we're doing a much better job of is having a better expectation of how scale advances in technology should drive the cost down. I'll give you a great example. When we launched EcoBoost more than a decade ago, we had 1 turbocharger supplier. We started with BorgWarner. Now we have 4. We've developed Honeywell, Continental, MAHLE. So we've driven down the design costs, but we've also driven down the commercial costs through greater scale, but also more competition in the marketplace. So what's our expectation of how the costs of the EcoBoost engines, how did that come down over time? How would you then extrapolate that to other technologies, such as rear cameras or automatic braking, all the things that we're being forced at into the vehicle, stop/start systems. So we're overlaying some of those things in -- as in the enabler for the $10 billion. On the $4 billion of engineering costs, it's just improving our engineering efficiency, reducing complexity, which Jim talked about, speeding up time to market and leveraging some of our joint venture partners.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I have more questions for Tau but -- for Hau, but are there any in the audience? One up front. Why don't you speak loudly? Sorry, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you just talk to the (inaudible) so which is some of the big tech companies, such as Google, now you've got (inaudible) there, as well. You've got Apple as well. How does Ford think about their role versus some of the big tech players as it comes to the consumer experience in the car? And how does Ford end up owning that experience versus some of the other tech players?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. So the question was really around the integrating some of the technologies into the vehicle and what does Ford view as ours versus others. I think a great example is what you'll hear this week. We're going to announce a partnership with Waze, and this is one where I know from personal experience. I drive a Lincoln Continental. This is our flagship luxury vehicle with all the latest technology. It's got a wonderful instrument cluster in it, all sorts of technology. And the first thing I do when I get in is I put my Waze on my iPhone and I stick it in front of my 12-inch cluster. Why? Because it works better for navigation, and it's crowd-sourced. It tells me where the police are hiding and I find value in that. I don't think I'm atypical. So for us, that's a great example of, is that something that Ford should invest engineering and capital to do or should we integrate Waze and have -- leverage that network effect of the crowd-sourcing of the Wazers into our vehicles? We're electing to do the latter. So we're doing -- you'll see us do more and more of that. You referenced Amazon Alexa integration. That's another thing. But as we do those things, we're also being very clear around who owns the data, what part is Ford's, what information is captured in the vehicle with our GPS system versus the smartphone in the case of Waze and then how do we monetize that? So that's very core in terms of our thinking.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Any other questions from the audience? One up front.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you talk about the 48-volt opportunities? Would you say, is that significant?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: It is significant. It's more significant in Europe. It tends to be a solution that's a better CO2 buy and CO2 reduction as a dollar buy for the driving cycle, the certification cycle in Europe. Smaller displacement engine as well as with manual transmissions, so we're going very heavy in terms of proliferating 48-volt systems in Europe. In the U.S., with the U.S. SORT cycles, the larger displacement engines and the higher penetration of automatic transmission, we don't see it as good of a weight buy -- fuel economy buy.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I wanted to ask how you balance in your job as head of product development to seemingly competing objectives. I mean, on the one hand, you want vehicles to be common and global. So the focus is the same in China as the U.S. as in Brazil, so that you can drive development and purchasing synergies. And then on the other hand, people have different tastes, different cultural preferences and needs in different markets. How do you balance those 2 competing interests? Are they not competing? How do you think about that?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: They are, at times, competing and I think this is probably one of our biggest learnings from ONE Ford, where we have to evolve our thinking, and it gets back to understanding the customers and what they want. And if the customers want the same things, then there's a huge opportunity for us to go to market with 1 global solution and not engineer it multiple times and leverage the global scale. But we're finding in markets like India, going back to our earlier discussion, those customers want very different things than the customers driving on the autobahn in Cologne, where we do a lot of our B car and C car engineering. So we have to really think through that, the customer lens on what they value. We're also finding that localization is becoming increasingly important, either because it's a requirement to get tax and tariff avoidance or it just makes sense as an exchange rate hedge. So if you have to localize with a local supplier, in the past, we typically would incentivize global suppliers to go invest and invest in brick-and-mortar in these far-flung regions. And there, we're finding that, that's not always the best way to get the best value. You're better off working with an Indian supplier versus asking your global suppliers to go into India because what we found is oftentimes, they'll say I -- that's not where I want to spend my capital. I'd rather put another plant in Mexico or China. I'll go to India if you want me to, but you're going to pay a premium for me to do that. So we're not realizing the savings. So I tell my team all the time, there's not a lot of sense in having a lot of scale of a design that's too expensive for that market, right? So what we're doing is -- as a combined team now, product development and purchasing, is for each commodity really thinking through how does the customer think about it? Is it truly a commodity that you can market test and source to the lowest bidder or is it something that's much more engineering investment intensive that you want 1 global partner to work with? And there's everything in between. How do we think through that as a company?</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Are there any more questions in the audience? It looks like there are several. [Paritosh]?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes. Just 2 quick ones. First, on the buy side, can you speak to what you're seeing with all the commodity inflation we've seen over the last 6 to 12 months, as far as how you guys go about procuring and the lead time lag associated with that? And the second, are you able to comment at all on product development and where they are with introducing or sharing their development work with [the customer].</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Argo AI?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Yes.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. So on the first question, we are still seeing some headwinds around commodities. What we try to do is really manage and mitigate those headwinds by staggering our contracts. So for example, when we buy steel or aluminum, we tend to stagger the contracts across the different suppliers that we work with so that they don't all expire at the same time. They're typically staggered by 6 months. That gives us a little bit of a hedge in terms of what's the month-to-month, week-to-week volatility in the commodity prices. And then obviously, we do our best to do substitution where we can and then improve utilization, but -- versus we had a tremendous windfall in commodity prices the year prior. And this year, we're just seeing the other side of it, and we're still seeing and anticipating some headwinds there. As you guys know, currency in many markets are tied directly to commodity prices. So there's also -- when we think about it, we also think about what's happening in the currency and there's a natural hedge there as well in terms of the cost basis. So it's not fair just to look only at commodities. On Argo AI, they're making great progress. I think you'll hear them talk more externally this year around some of the objectives and key milestones that they're achieving. We're very confident in that investment that we've made, that it's the right thing to do for us to accelerate our vision of delivering autonomous vehicles to market.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: I think we have time for just 1 more question in the front here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So today, I mean, there are probably like 20 of (inaudible) driving platform in the marketplace. Each OEM has their own kind of a platform. Each big tech company has their own. But if you look like -- I mean, in the future, in Asia and in Europe, I don't think there will be a like a 20-platform environment. So what do you think of the competitive landscape is going to evolve, in like a long term? Who will be the winner? How many platform would be (inaudible)?</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Yes. I think -- again, you have to differentiate, are we talking about Level 2, Level 3 or Level 4 autonomy? And even that as a definition, I think is too -- it's not granular enough. So there's a big difference in Level 3 at -- are we talking below 40 miles an hour or above 55 miles an hour? Are we talking divided highway or non-divided highway? So the -- I can speak to what Ford is doing. We believe for Level 4 autonomy, there's ride-hailing and goods movement that Jim Farley and <person><nameText>Jim Hackett </nameText></person>talked about earlier, this -- controlling the thinking phase, the algorithm for the virtual driving system is going to be core to Ford and brand differentiating, and that's something that we want to develop with partnership with Argo AI. And I think like most things, initially, you'll have a lot of competitors, but it will -- your premise is correct. You'll see consolidation and it will probably be down to a handful of players in that space, once they start getting into markets. Most likely, the solutions in China, because of the regulatory and national security concerns, will be different than solutions in other markets. So you may have to double the number of players if you include China versus Western Europe and North America. Level 3 and Level 2, I think this is clearly going to be in the domain of the supply base. You guys just walked out of Aptiv. They're one of the big players. There's other people: the Continentals and DENSOs and Boschs of the world that are all involved, and I anticipate that they'll be probably half a dozen very strong players, if not more, in that space as well.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Very interesting. That's all the time we have today, but please join me in thanking Hau for coming to the conference.</p><p>HAU THAI-TANG: Thank you.</p><p>RYAN J. BRINKMAN: Thank you.

The modern car company sees itself as not just a part of the $2.3 trillion auto industry, where it has a 6 percent market share, but as a member of the $5.4 trillion transportation market. We attended Ford's press event at CES, the big tech trade show[2] in Las Vegas last week. At the event, Ford CEO Mark Fields said the company would triple the number of autonomous vehicles it is testing and adopt Velodyne's solid-state hybrid Ultra Puck auto sensor for precision mapping. Ford is partnering with drone maker DJI to develop drone-to-vehicle technology for emergency services. And it is also working on ways that you can send voice commands to your car to get its motor running in the morning. After the press event, we sat down with Don Butler, executive director of Ford's connected vehicles and services, in an interview.\u00a0Here's an edited transcript of our conversation. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSCN0106.jpg\">http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/DSCN0106.jpg</url> Above: Ford CEO Mark Fields at CES 2016. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi VentureBeat: If you have a bunch of electric vehicles coming, what sort of percentage of the whole is that, and at what time? Don Butler: Electric vehicles, for us, represent a means of attaining some of the efficiency requirements we have. Either fully or partially electrified vehicles will represent up to a quarter of our lineup within the next five or so years. Now, part of that will depend on consumer appetite for those vehicles. We have to make sure that they're desirable, that they meet consumer expectations. Also, when we look at fuel prices, we need to make sure we get, at least within the U.S., the chance for the government to reassess the standards and understand what's feasible. We can make [the cars], but we need people to buy them. VB: On autonomous vehicles, some people thought you were going to talk more about Google and some kind of alliance? Butler: Did they? [laughs] Not sure why they'd have that opinion. We work with a number of partners, as our CEO has described, underneath this umbrella we call Fort Smart Mobility. Whether you're talking connectivity, or some of the mobility experiments and services we're looking at, the overall customer experience \u2014 We used to say our customers' digital lifestyles are connected lifestyles. That's understood now in autonomous driving and big data and analytics. We recognize that we will need to work with partners in the space, because as we look at the vehicle as more than just a piece of hardware that moves you from A to B, we're increasingly looking at the vehicle as a platform for the delivery of services. Some of those services we'll be able to deliver end to end. Financing. That's a good example. Ford Credit, we can do financing for you. Other services we'll connect with partners that are already developing their own ecosystems. We'll take advantage of that development without having to do it. What we're doing with Amazon is a good example. Amazon, the Eco device, and the Alexa cloud platform, they're already in the home, in many homes. They're already connecting with other smart things in the home. Rather than us stitching together that network, why don't we partner with someone who already is putting that network together and create a way of seamlessly interacting with them? When we look at autonomous vehicles, we've been working on that for more than a decade. It's not as if we need a partner to come help us. We are open to working with partners together to create autonomous vehicles, but it's not a situation where we become a contract manufacturer for someone. We talk about news when it's ready to be talked about. What you saw today, we talked about our partnership with Velodyne, our work with the University of Michigan. We're continuing to advance on the autonomous front. As developments occur, we'll be sure to communicate about those. &lt;nl/&gt;Play Video[3] VB: I've read a bit about some of the challenges for self-driving cars. I wonder what you think is the state of things in that field, how far the research has gotten. Butler: The research has advanced quite a bit. That's one reason we've moved from the pure research phase to what we call the 'advanced engineering phase.' The pure research phase is one around just feasibility. Is it feasible to have a car drive itself? Now we're in a stage where we've proven that. Now the question is, how would you implement it? That's why we're expanding our fleet, moving from about 10 vehicles to about 30. The bulk of that fleet will be in the Michigan area. A lot of that work will be at Em City, at our own proving grounds in Dearborn. Some of that work will be in California. We recently announced that we've received a license to operate autonomous vehicles in California. The technical side is coming along really well. The thing we need to work on is continuing to refine the algorithms and our sensor technology. You see an example of that with Velodyne, working with them to shrink the size of the LIDAR [Light Detection and Ranging] sensor. Our goal is what we call level four autonomy, which is fully autonomous, driver out of the loop, but only in known geographic locations and known conditions. That's what we're aiming for. From a technical standpoint it's very much within reach, within the next four years. What we need to work on at the same time are some of the regulatory and liability issues. Some of the societal issues in terms of autonomous vehicles interacting with vehicles that are being driven. It's a situation where the landscape continues to evolve. We're evolving and adapting with it. We're focusing on the technical challenges and working with other partners, like universities and governments, on the regulatory, liability, and societal sides.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ford-ceo.jpg\">http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ford-ceo.jpg</url> Above: Ford CEO Mark Fields says people searching for parking cause 30% of congestion. Image Credit: Ford VB: Things like LIDAR, are they the likely path for tackling that problem? Butler: From the exposure I've had, LIDAR\u00a0and its ability to, first of all, do 360 degrees, and then the ability to do precise 3D mapping -That's critical. And then for the vehicle to have a really clear sense of where it is within that environment. We think you can't just rely on cameras or radar or other sensors. We think it's a combination of all of those that's going to be necessary. One of the challenges is those unanticipated or unexpected things. It's fairly easy to map a static environment, and even to map the roadway and expectations of what happens on it. There's no way to map pedestrian behavior, or the behavior of the bicyclist right next to you and what happens if they don't obey a stop sign. Encountering those situations and understanding the parameters that lead into that will impact and affect those deep learning algorithms. But we're all exploring similar territory. We'll be working partners where it makes sense, bringing our own knowledge and expertise to bear. VB: And then the other big problem of just waking up the human. Butler: That's why we're focusing on level four. There are two different paths happening. What we call the semi-autonomous path, levels one through three, the driver will still need to be engaged, but we're doing things to assist in the driving experience, like adaptive cruise control or panic stop braking. But we believe that when you're in autonomous, you need to be in a situation where the vehicle can drive itself. We're looking at what that means. How do you operate in a situation where you have to hand control back to the driver? That's a tough area. Other than saying, 'You need to keep your hands on the wheel.' It's interesting to look at companies like Tesla and what they're doing with autopilot. It's funny. It even says 'Beta' on the screen, and yet it's out in production. Our goal, though, and what we're working on with our autonomous fleet, is level four, driver completely out of the loop.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ford-ceo-2.jpg\">http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ford-ceo-2.jpg</url> Above: Ford CEO Mark Fields has stats on how the roads are getting more congested. Image Credit: Ford VB: It still seems like the problem that Mark painted about how crowded cities are going to get isn't all that solvable with smarter things. Butler: It's certainly more addressable. The smarter things are, the more connected they are. Then we have the opportunity to do things much more efficiently - things like route-planning and logistics. We have a partnership with a fleet services company called Telogis. They work with other companies that have large fleets of vehicles. They help them manage those fleets. Most of those vehicles happen to be Fords, so we've worked with them to provide telematics capability within vehicles to do things like managing and monitoring fuel consumption, logistics planning, map pathing, and planning for those vehicles out in the market. If everything can become that much more efficient by being connected, you reduce congestion. You reduce traffic. Things become more efficient. We're also working with cities. Even our Go Drive pilot, we're working with the city of London on understanding their goals and how we can participate with them in helping to achieve those. Certainly the challenges that Mark outlined are daunting. We also recognize them. We're not hiding from them. We're taking steps to address them. The more connected our world is and the more willing we are to work with partners, I think we will find solutions. VB: Anything else you'd like to focus on? Butler: Another great example of working with partners is, again, what we're doing with Amazon. The point of this whole notion is, we understand that the vehicle is no longer just a piece of hardware that gets you from A to B. We are no longer just in the vehicle hardware business. That represents, if you saw the presentation today, $2.3 trillion of revenue. The transportation services business is $5.4 trillion. Even beyond that, the commerce that's conducted while you're traveling represents an even bigger and broader opportunity. For us it's about interacting and intersecting with those areas of opportunity and understanding how we can put enablers in place \u2014 like App Link inside our vehicles for connecting with smartphone apps - to help create this new future. The important part is, we've been around for 113 years. I think we'll be around for many more years beyond that. We've demonstrated resilience. Things that have been disrupters in the past, we've looked at as opportunities, and we look at today in a similar way. VB: It's like railroads and the transportation business. Which are you in? Butler: We're definitely in the mobility business. That's what we're in. VB: It made me think of Ford Airways, Ford Tollways\u2026 Butler: Or working with partners in those areas, for sure.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ford-ceo-3.jpg\">http://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ford-ceo-3.jpg</url> Above: Ford CEO Mark Fields wants to move beyond cars into transportation services.

And that might sound like a good thing, but it could bring both help and problems for firefighters battling the ongoing camp fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: The rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides. It would also affect the crews searching for the remains of the victims. We know this morning at least 79 people have died. Almost - 700, rather, remain unaccounted for in this wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paul Vercammen joins us from Paradise, California. Paul, you know, what are they up against as they continue to fight this right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's just show you, Poppy and Jim, what they're up against is an immense debris field, never seen before in California because you never had it where a small city was obliterated. Look at the restaurant that was behind me. You can see the chairs where people sat.</p><p>And one of the worries for first responders, do you see all of that debris and ash? It can be moved along by water rather quickly. And what they fear is lots of the stuff is going to go down the hill, as they call it here in Butte County, and what could complicate things for first responders is if that becomes an ashy slurry mess, and they're on these mountain roads trying to take care of their business, they will be in treacherous conditions. They're also worried about people sleeping outside. They have done a very good job from what we have seen so far in moving people out of makeshift camps and into the shelters, but that's what they're worried about, this becoming one muddy problem in the middle of what is continuing to be a cleanup of a fire.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Last thing those poor people there need. And thanks for continuing to follow that story. We're going to keep at it because the suffering continues there.</p><p>HARLOW: It does continue.</p><p>OK. Let's take a quick look at the markets right now. About an hour into trading and the Dow is off 472 points, largely a sell-off driven by concerns about technology companies. We'll get a live update from the New York Stock Exchange next.</p><p>[10:36:55] HARLOW: All right. Welcome back.</p><p>In just hours, a highly anticipated debate takes place for the Mississippi Senate seat, a seat that once looked like a slam dunk for Republicans. That until the Republican candidate, Cindy Hyde Smith, was caught on tape joking about going to a public hanging. In another recording, she said she would welcome certain forms of voter suppression. Here team later said she was joking about that as well. But it has really opened the door for the Democratic candidate Mike Espy, a former Congressman, who if he wins will be the first black senator from Mississippi in over a century. The two face off in a run- off one week from today.</p><p>Adam Ganucheau is with us, political reporter from \"Mississippi Today.\" Good morning. Thank you for being here.</p><p>I'm fascinated by this for so many reasons, including the fact that this is a state that the president won by nearly 18 percent. This should be in the bag for Republicans. It is not, largely because of these controversial comments. Could we see an Alabama-style upset on Tuesday in your state?</p><p>ADAM GANUCHEAU, POLITICAL REPORTER, \"MISSISSIPPI TODAY\": Well, I think Democrats and Republicans both are now thinking it's possible, Poppy. You know, it's a tough thing for a Democrat in Mississippi to win. I guess that's the bottom line. But reports this week have Espy down just five points. And as you said, in Mississippi, that's a really big deal. These two videos that have surfaced in the last week or two, you know, really, I think, have tightened this race and made sort of this national intrigue and brought a lot of out of state cash to Mississippi.</p><p>HARLOW: You know, what I think is interesting is sort of the defense that the Republican candidate, that she and her team are taking here because - I mean, she's essentially taking a page Hyde Smith is out of the Trump playbook. Because Espy called her a walking stereotype who is an embarrassment to the state, those are his words. She responds on Twitter saying, is it still OK to have a sense of humor in America? Isn't it? I mean, are the people of Mississippi laughing?</p><p>GANUCHEAU: Well, you know, it just depends on who you talk to. I will say this. There's not a single Mississippian that either myself or my colleagues have spoken with in the last two weeks who haven't at least heard this video or seen this video.</p><p>HARLOW: Interesting.</p><p>GANUCHEAU: You know, it is sort of, you know, split by racial lines and of course by party lines to some degree, but without exception, the Mississippians I think who are sort of defending this or you know calling this sort of the attack of the politically correct in America or the state of Mississippi, without exception, those are conservative white people. And most of the people who are upset about this are of course African-Americans in Mississippi.</p><p>HARLOW: Which make up about 38 percent of the electorate in Mississippi, African-Americans and let's not forget, Mississippi had more lynchings that are on record, of course, many lynchings were not ever recorded, but more than 600 lynchings on record, making it the highest number in any state in this country. But the way that the Democrat Mike Espy is running is also really interesting to me because he's got some big, you know, Democrat names coming there for him. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California, and he's embracing that, but he's also making very clear he's not a liberal, liberal.</p><p>[10:40:04] GANUCHEAU: That's right. You have to remember that, you know, Mike Espy has already made history in Mississippi. He was the first African-American Congressman in the state since reconstruction. If he were elected, he would be, like you said, the first African- American senator elected by popular vote in Mississippi, at least, back to reconstruction. But you know he really has embraced Senator Kamala Harris this week, Senator Cory Booker.</p><p>You know I was in a classroom this week with some African-American students. Elementary school students, and when Espy was there, he sort of talked about, you know, there have only been 10 U.S. Senators in history of the country that are African-American. So you know he's really pushing this. And you know, I think at this point, that's certainly a strategy of theirs, of sort of to you know, talk about that history, how he's already made history and sort of pitch how he could continue that.</p><p>HARLOW: So the president will be there on Monday, trying to make the final push that clearly Hyde Smith's team thinks they need to get over the finish line here for the election on Tuesday. But before you go, there is controversy also that is surrounding Espy. It has to do with lobbying work that he did back in 2010. This was for the Ivory Coast. Of course, the president at the time is now being tried in the ICC for crimes against humanity. There's a controversy over payments that he received. Is that weighing on him?</p><p>GANUCHEAU: I mean, I think it's something he certainly had to deal with. He's faced several, you know sort of questions about that. Espy and Hyde Smith actually tonight are having their first and what looks like their only debate before next week's election. I think you know we can expect that to come up. You know, for Espy's part, he's sort of said, you know, backed out of this. He said that in 2011, and then in 2014, there was a Department of Justice filing that suggested he actually got full payment.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>GANUCHEAU: So, it's something that he's going to have to continue to answer to. It's certainly affected his campaign.</p><p>HARLOW: Sure. You'll have a late night covering that debate. It will be an interesting and important one. Adam, we appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.</p><p>We're going to be right back with a quick check on the markets. The Dow off 420 points at the moment.</p><p>[10:46:45] HARLOW: All right. This morning we're keeping a very close eye on Wall Street. There's why. You've got the Dow off 414 points, largely driven by a sell-off in tech stocks.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Joining us now from the New York Stock Exchange, CNN business anchor and anchor of \"First Move\" Julia Chatterley. So, Julia, we have seen a fair number of days like this. Several hundred points down, 1 percent, 2 percent. Of course, the market over the course of the year, flat, it's actually below flat at this point. But when you're speaking to traders there, what do they see different in the last several days and with today's fall? Are they concerned this is part of something bigger?</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": That's a great question, Jim, a great view on the show. OK, I give you two things. One, today for the first time all year, we have completely wiped out the gains that the U.S. equity markets have made. So just in terms of sentiment, people are looking at the situation now and going, does this mean it's a good opportunity to get back into the market and buy? Or do you stand back and see how much further this can fall?</p><p>The other thing is, the thing that's been lifting the markets all year has been the big tech stocks, Apple, Amazon, two great examples. And suddenly we're seeing those stocks down 20 percent from the highs. So people are looking at this and going, if they're not going to lead the border markets higher, what is? Those two things I think are very important here. And it's not just about stocks. Oil prices today, they're off 6 percent. There's just a real sense of uncertainty in these markets. And I tie it back to trade and the headlines that we got over the weekend coming into this week. And of course, Poppy, I know you'll know this very well. The Federal Reserve, will Jay Powell continue to hike rates, and the fear remains that he'll overshoot in terms of interest rates. And that weighs growth here too.</p><p>HARLOW: All great points. When you look at the sell-off in tech stocks, though, it's the driver today, as you noted. And it doesn't seem like it's going to be a one-off, Julia, or a just for now. I mean what these tech companies are looking at is what's facing Facebook right now after that damning \"New York Times\" report, and the regulation in Europe with GDRP, and the reality that a reckoning is coming, right? A reckoning is coming for these companies that will fundamentally change the way they have to do business. And that's going to be a prolonged bit of pain for them, no?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more. I mean we've had Tim Cook this week saying, guys, get ready. More regulation is coming. You're going to have to get used to it. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has been under the spotlight for the last few months. We have seen that stock punished. Even the ones that we thought were the strongest like Apple. They're having reports now that they're struggling to sell iPhones to the size that they were hoping to. So all around, there's individual stories that mean they're going to be challenged going forward. And it's a real headache. You know and I take it back to trade. A lot of people I'm speaking to right now are saying when you look at the tensions between Vice President Mike Pence at the weekend with Xi Jinping, there's not going to be a solution here either anytime soon. It's tough.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Julia Chatterley, we know we're going to keep coming back to you there as we follow this. Thanks very much.</p><p>Coming up next, a stunning new CNN investigation uncovers hundreds of mishaps involving armed Federal Air Marshals and their firearms.</p><p>[10:54:25] SCIUTTO: Loaded guns left behind in bathrooms. Accidental misfires onboard. Officers hired to keep you safe on airplanes are now accused in a range of gun misuse cases.</p><p>HARLOW: This is all according to the CNN investigation that our colleague Drew Griffin did that uncovered more than 200 alleged gun mishaps by Federal Air Marshals. Our senior investigative correspondent Drew Griffin is here. This is stunning, Drew.</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: You know, guys, just last month, yet another air marshal committed suicide. We've reported extensively on these suicides by the air marshals in the past. It's what prompted us to ask the federal government for every record involving mishaps and air marshals. This is what we found.</p><p>[10:55:05] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): These documents released to CNN through a Freedom of Information Act request reveal more than 200 cases of alleged misconduct by Federal Air Marshals involving firearms. Men and women supposedly well trained to use their weapons in one of the most dangerous environments. Misplacing, misfiring. Even accidentally and not so accidentally shooting themselves. Documents released to CNN include 19 accidental discharges, including an air marshal who caused a gunshot wound to his right foot. Another accidentally discharged his firearm in a hotel room, hitting a television in the adjoining room. More than 70 cases of air marshals losing weapons, three times air marshals have left their service weapons in an airplane's bathroom. They've left weapons in restrooms, bars, even a bed, bath, and beyond in New Jersey. In at least 13 cases, alcohol was involved.</p><p>After releasing the documents, the Federal Air Marshal Service invited CNN to the Air Marshal Training Academy outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where new air marshals are taught how to handle their weapons and top instructor Daniel Kowal admitted the reports are embarrassing.</p><p>DANIEL KOWAL, SUPERVISORY AIR MARSHAL: We look at what was the underlying cause, what happened? If and when training failed, how and why did it fail? How do we plug that gap? How do we fix that? Our goal as the training department is to strive for zero percent error.</p><p>GRIFFIN: It's hard to compare if air marshals are more or less dangerous with weapons than other law enforcement agencies because the number of air marshals is classified. But former air marshals tell CNN any mishap is unacceptable because their agents operate at 34,000 feet.</p><p>HENRY PRESTON, FORMER AIR MARSHAL TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: There's no backup. You have got to take care of business. And you got to do it very quickly and efficiently.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Henry Preston, who spent 10 years in the service, says he observed a decline in weapons training and practice, year by year. Inconsistencies he said, that could contribute to mistakes.</p><p>PRESTON: They need additional training. There's no doubt about it.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Oddly, three of the apparent mishaps occurred during firearms training. In one case, an instructor allegedly threw training bullets called Simunition into an open flame. They exploded, and one staff member was struck in the face by flying debris. Problems are nothing new to the controversial air marshal service. CNN has previously reported agents have continually complained about low morale, low staffing, grueling hours.</p><p>A 2012 sleep study obtained by CNN shows 75 percent of domestic air marshals were flying while sleep deficient. That study found that lack of sleep puts them at greater incidents of serious errors. Critics question if air marshals are even necessary. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general slammed the air marshal service and said its contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable. Ohio state professor John Mueller, who studies the efficiencies of security measures, says nearly $1 billion agency is almost worthless.</p><p>JOHN MUELLER, POLITICAL SCIENTIST, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY: Federal Air Marshals simply don't pass muster in terms of cost/benefit analysis. They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Now, the revelation that at least 200 cases where agents made dangerous mistakes is yet another strike against the Federal Air Marshals program.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN: The TSA tells us the air marshals are trained to the highest levels. The problem, Poppy and Jim, is the air marshals we have been talking to say that's just not true. And in 2016, the government accountability office said the record keeping is so bad that it's really hard to tell if these agents are trained and retrained to proper specifications. TSA insists that's all fixed now.</p><p>SCIUTTO: The air marshals themselves are identifying this is a problem. I'm curious, just to be clear. Did any of these mishaps happen in the air with passengers onboard? Were passengers put in danger?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Several cases where these guns that were left in airplane bathrooms were found by the passengers themselves. That's how these guns were discovered. So the answer is yes. Does that put a passenger in danger? Well, I guess it depends on which passenger picks it up. But I would say absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm struck by so much in your report, but especially the record keeping. The record keeping was so messy that they don't really have the ability to say were these people trained up to snuff or not. How can that be?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Poppy, I have been reporting on the air marshal service for 10 years. This is a service that got ramped up right after 9/11. I believe ill thought out and it's been a mess ever since. And since we've hardened the cockpit doors, many people just say we don't need these guys sitting on planes.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Interesting question. Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm Jim Sciutto.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm Poppy Harlow. We'll see you back here tomorrow morning. \"At This Hour\" with Kate Bolduan starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018112004CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSN-PR71-JB20-G1W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2913\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

And that might sound like a good thing, but it could bring both help and problems for firefighters battling the ongoing camp fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: The rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides. It would also affect the crews searching for the remains of the victims. We know this morning at least 79 people have died. Almost - 700, rather, remain unaccounted for in this wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paul Vercammen joins us from Paradise, California. Paul, you know, what are they up against as they continue to fight this right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's just show you, Poppy and Jim, what they're up against is an immense debris field, never seen before in California because you never had it where a small city was obliterated. Look at the restaurant that was behind me. You can see the chairs where people sat.</p><p>And one of the worries for first responders, do you see all of that debris and ash? It can be moved along by water rather quickly. And what they fear is lots of the stuff is going to go down the hill, as they call it here in Butte County, and what could complicate things for first responders is if that becomes an ashy slurry mess, and they're on these mountain roads trying to take care of their business, they will be in treacherous conditions. They're also worried about people sleeping outside. They have done a very good job from what we have seen so far in moving people out of makeshift camps and into the shelters, but that's what they're worried about, this becoming one muddy problem in the middle of what is continuing to be a cleanup of a fire.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Last thing those poor people there need. And thanks for continuing to follow that story. We're going to keep at it because the suffering continues there.</p><p>HARLOW: It does continue.</p><p>OK. Let's take a quick look at the markets right now. About an hour into trading and the Dow is off 472 points, largely a sell-off driven by concerns about technology companies. We'll get a live update from the New York Stock Exchange next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:36:55] HARLOW: All right. Welcome back.</p><p>In just hours, a highly anticipated debate takes place for the Mississippi Senate seat, a seat that once looked like a slam dunk for Republicans. That until the Republican candidate, Cindy Hyde Smith, was caught on tape joking about going to a public hanging. In another recording, she said she would welcome certain forms of voter suppression. Here team later said she was joking about that as well. But it has really opened the door for the Democratic candidate Mike Espy, a former Congressman, who if he wins will be the first black senator from Mississippi in over a century. The two face off in a run- off one week from today.</p><p>Adam Ganucheau is with us, political reporter from \"Mississippi Today.\" Good morning. Thank you for being here.</p><p>I'm fascinated by this for so many reasons, including the fact that this is a state that the president won by nearly 18 percent. This should be in the bag for Republicans. It is not, largely because of these controversial comments. Could we see an Alabama-style upset on Tuesday in your state?</p><p>ADAM GANUCHEAU, POLITICAL REPORTER, \"MISSISSIPPI TODAY\": Well, I think Democrats and Republicans both are now thinking it's possible, Poppy. You know, it's a tough thing for a Democrat in Mississippi to win. I guess that's the bottom line. But reports this week have Espy down just five points. And as you said, in Mississippi, that's a really big deal. These two videos that have surfaced in the last week or two, you know, really, I think, have tightened this race and made sort of this national intrigue and brought a lot of out of state cash to Mississippi.</p><p>HARLOW: You know, what I think is interesting is sort of the defense that the Republican candidate, that she and her team are taking here because - I mean, she's essentially taking a page Hyde Smith is out of the Trump playbook. Because Espy called her a walking stereotype who is an embarrassment to the state, those are his words. She responds on Twitter saying, is it still OK to have a sense of humor in America? Isn't it? I mean, are the people of Mississippi laughing?</p><p>GANUCHEAU: Well, you know, it just depends on who you talk to. I will say this. There's not a single Mississippian that either myself or my colleagues have spoken with in the last two weeks who haven't at least heard this video or seen this video.</p><p>HARLOW: Interesting.</p><p>GANUCHEAU: You know, it is sort of, you know, split by racial lines and of course by party lines to some degree, but without exception, the Mississippians I think who are sort of defending this or you know calling this sort of the attack of the politically correct in America or the state of Mississippi, without exception, those are conservative white people. And most of the people who are upset about this are of course African-Americans in Mississippi.</p><p>HARLOW: Which make up about 38 percent of the electorate in Mississippi, African-Americans and let's not forget, Mississippi had more lynchings that are on record, of course, many lynchings were not ever recorded, but more than 600 lynchings on record, making it the highest number in any state in this country. But the way that the Democrat Mike Espy is running is also really interesting to me because he's got some big, you know, Democrat names coming there for him. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California, and he's embracing that, but he's also making very clear he's not a liberal, liberal.</p><p>[10:40:04] GANUCHEAU: That's right. You have to remember that, you know, Mike Espy has already made history in Mississippi. He was the first African-American Congressman in the state since reconstruction. If he were elected, he would be, like you said, the first African- American senator elected by popular vote in Mississippi, at least, back to reconstruction. But you know he really has embraced Senator Kamala Harris this week, Senator Cory Booker.</p><p>You know I was in a classroom this week with some African-American students. Elementary school students, and when Espy was there, he sort of talked about, you know, there have only been 10 U.S. Senators in history of the country that are African-American. So you know he's really pushing this. And you know, I think at this point, that's certainly a strategy of theirs, of sort of to you know, talk about that history, how he's already made history and sort of pitch how he could continue that.</p><p>HARLOW: So the president will be there on Monday, trying to make the final push that clearly Hyde Smith's team thinks they need to get over the finish line here for the election on Tuesday. But before you go, there is controversy also that is surrounding Espy. It has to do with lobbying work that he did back in 2010. This was for the Ivory Coast. Of course, the president at the time is now being tried in the ICC for crimes against humanity. There's a controversy over payments that he received. Is that weighing on him?</p><p>GANUCHEAU: I mean, I think it's something he certainly had to deal with. He's faced several, you know sort of questions about that. Espy and Hyde Smith actually tonight are having their first and what looks like their only debate before next week's election. I think you know we can expect that to come up. You know, for Espy's part, he's sort of said, you know, backed out of this. He said that in 2011, and then in 2014, there was a Department of Justice filing that suggested he actually got full payment.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>GANUCHEAU: So, it's something that he's going to have to continue to answer to. It's certainly affected his campaign.</p><p>HARLOW: Sure. You'll have a late night covering that debate. It will be an interesting and important one. Adam, we appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.</p><p>We're going to be right back with a quick check on the markets. The Dow off 420 points at the moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:46:45] HARLOW: All right. This morning we're keeping a very close eye on Wall Street. There's why. You've got the Dow off 414 points, largely driven by a sell-off in tech stocks.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Joining us now from the New York Stock Exchange, CNN business anchor and anchor of \"First Move\" Julia Chatterley. So, Julia, we have seen a fair number of days like this. Several hundred points down, 1 percent, 2 percent. Of course, the market over the course of the year, flat, it's actually below flat at this point. But when you're speaking to traders there, what do they see different in the last several days and with today's fall? Are they concerned this is part of something bigger?</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": That's a great question, Jim, a great view on the show. OK, I give you two things. One, today for the first time all year, we have completely wiped out the gains that the U.S. equity markets have made. So just in terms of sentiment, people are looking at the situation now and going, does this mean it's a good opportunity to get back into the market and buy? Or do you stand back and see how much further this can fall?</p><p>The other thing is, the thing that's been lifting the markets all year has been the big tech stocks, Apple, Amazon, two great examples. And suddenly we're seeing those stocks down 20 percent from the highs. So people are looking at this and going, if they're not going to lead the border markets higher, what is? Those two things I think are very important here. And it's not just about stocks. Oil prices today, they're off 6 percent. There's just a real sense of uncertainty in these markets. And I tie it back to trade and the headlines that we got over the weekend coming into this week. And of course, Poppy, I know you'll know this very well. The Federal Reserve, will Jay Powell continue to hike rates, and the fear remains that he'll overshoot in terms of interest rates. And that weighs growth here too.</p><p>HARLOW: All great points. When you look at the sell-off in tech stocks, though, it's the driver today, as you noted. And it doesn't seem like it's going to be a one-off, Julia, or a just for now. I mean what these tech companies are looking at is what's facing Facebook right now after that damning \"New York Times\" report, and the regulation in Europe with GDRP, and the reality that a reckoning is coming, right? A reckoning is coming for these companies that will fundamentally change the way they have to do business. And that's going to be a prolonged bit of pain for them, no?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more. I mean we've had Tim Cook this week saying, guys, get ready. More regulation is coming. You're going to have to get used to it. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has been under the spotlight for the last few months. We have seen that stock punished. Even the ones that we thought were the strongest like Apple. They're having reports now that they're struggling to sell iPhones to the size that they were hoping to. So all around, there's individual stories that mean they're going to be challenged going forward. And it's a real headache. You know and I take it back to trade. A lot of people I'm speaking to right now are saying when you look at the tensions between Vice President Mike Pence at the weekend with Xi Jinping, there's not going to be a solution here either anytime soon. It's tough.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Julia Chatterley, we know we're going to keep coming back to you there as we follow this. Thanks very much.</p><p>Coming up next, a stunning new CNN investigation uncovers hundreds of mishaps involving armed Federal Air Marshals and their firearms.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:54:25] SCIUTTO: Loaded guns left behind in bathrooms. Accidental misfires onboard. Officers hired to keep you safe on airplanes are now accused in a range of gun misuse cases.</p><p>HARLOW: This is all according to the CNN investigation that our colleague Drew Griffin did that uncovered more than 200 alleged gun mishaps by Federal Air Marshals. Our senior investigative correspondent Drew Griffin is here. This is stunning, Drew.</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: You know, guys, just last month, yet another air marshal committed suicide. We've reported extensively on these suicides by the air marshals in the past. It's what prompted us to ask the federal government for every record involving mishaps and air marshals. This is what we found.</p><p>[10:55:05] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): These documents released to CNN through a Freedom of Information Act request reveal more than 200 cases of alleged misconduct by Federal Air Marshals involving firearms. Men and women supposedly well trained to use their weapons in one of the most dangerous environments. Misplacing, misfiring. Even accidentally and not so accidentally shooting themselves. Documents released to CNN include 19 accidental discharges, including an air marshal who caused a gunshot wound to his right foot. Another accidentally discharged his firearm in a hotel room, hitting a television in the adjoining room. More than 70 cases of air marshals losing weapons, three times air marshals have left their service weapons in an airplane's bathroom. They've left weapons in restrooms, bars, even a bed, bath, and beyond in New Jersey. In at least 13 cases, alcohol was involved.</p><p>After releasing the documents, the Federal Air Marshal Service invited CNN to the Air Marshal Training Academy outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where new air marshals are taught how to handle their weapons and top instructor Daniel Kowal admitted the reports are embarrassing.</p><p>DANIEL KOWAL, SUPERVISORY AIR MARSHAL: We look at what was the underlying cause, what happened? If and when training failed, how and why did it fail? How do we plug that gap? How do we fix that? Our goal as the training department is to strive for zero percent error.</p><p>GRIFFIN: It's hard to compare if air marshals are more or less dangerous with weapons than other law enforcement agencies because the number of air marshals is classified. But former air marshals tell CNN any mishap is unacceptable because their agents operate at 34,000 feet.</p><p>HENRY PRESTON, FORMER AIR MARSHAL TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: There's no backup. You have got to take care of business. And you got to do it very quickly and efficiently.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Henry Preston, who spent 10 years in the service, says he observed a decline in weapons training and practice, year by year. Inconsistencies he said, that could contribute to mistakes.</p><p>PRESTON: They need additional training. There's no doubt about it.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Oddly, three of the apparent mishaps occurred during firearms training. In one case, an instructor allegedly threw training bullets called Simunition into an open flame. They exploded, and one staff member was struck in the face by flying debris. Problems are nothing new to the controversial air marshal service. CNN has previously reported agents have continually complained about low morale, low staffing, grueling hours.</p><p>A 2012 sleep study obtained by CNN shows 75 percent of domestic air marshals were flying while sleep deficient. That study found that lack of sleep puts them at greater incidents of serious errors. Critics question if air marshals are even necessary. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general slammed the air marshal service and said its contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable. Ohio state professor John Mueller, who studies the efficiencies of security measures, says nearly $1 billion agency is almost worthless.</p><p>JOHN MUELLER, POLITICAL SCIENTIST, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY: Federal Air Marshals simply don't pass muster in terms of cost/benefit analysis. They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Now, the revelation that at least 200 cases where agents made dangerous mistakes is yet another strike against the Federal Air Marshals program.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN: The TSA tells us the air marshals are trained to the highest levels. The problem, Poppy and Jim, is the air marshals we have been talking to say that's just not true. And in 2016, the government accountability office said the record keeping is so bad that it's really hard to tell if these agents are trained and retrained to proper specifications. TSA insists that's all fixed now.</p><p>SCIUTTO: The air marshals themselves are identifying this is a problem. I'm curious, just to be clear. Did any of these mishaps happen in the air with passengers onboard? Were passengers put in danger?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Several cases where these guns that were left in airplane bathrooms were found by the passengers themselves. That's how these guns were discovered. So the answer is yes. Does that put a passenger in danger? Well, I guess it depends on which passenger picks it up. But I would say absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm struck by so much in your report, but especially the record keeping. The record keeping was so messy that they don't really have the ability to say were these people trained up to snuff or not. How can that be?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Poppy, I have been reporting on the air marshal service for 10 years. This is a service that got ramped up right after 9/11. I believe ill thought out and it's been a mess ever since. And since we've hardened the cockpit doors, many people just say we don't need these guys sitting on planes.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Interesting question. Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm Jim Sciutto.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm Poppy Harlow. We'll see you back here tomorrow morning. \"At This Hour\" with Kate Bolduan starts now.</p><p>[Byline: Poppy Harlow, Jim Sciutto, Paul Vercammen, Julia Chatterley, Drew Griffin] [Guest: Adam Ganucheau] [High: Rain in the forecast tomorrow for Northern California.

And that might sound like a good thing, but it could bring both help and problems for firefighters battling the ongoing camp fire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: The rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides. It would also affect the crews searching for the remains of the victims. We know this morning at least 79 people have died. Almost - 700, rather, remain unaccounted for in this wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paul Vercammen joins us from Paradise, California. Paul, you know, what are they up against as they continue to fight this right now?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAUL VERCAMMEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's just show you, Poppy and Jim, what they're up against is an immense debris field, never seen before in California because you never had it where a small city was obliterated. Look at the restaurant that was behind me. You can see the chairs where people sat.</p><p>And one of the worries for first responders, do you see all of that debris and ash? It can be moved along by water rather quickly. And what they fear is lots of the stuff is going to go down the hill, as they call it here in Butte County, and what could complicate things for first responders is if that becomes an ashy slurry mess, and they're on these mountain roads trying to take care of their business, they will be in treacherous conditions. They're also worried about people sleeping outside. They have done a very good job from what we have seen so far in moving people out of makeshift camps and into the shelters, but that's what they're worried about, this becoming one muddy problem in the middle of what is continuing to be a cleanup of a fire.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Last thing those poor people there need. And thanks for continuing to follow that story. We're going to keep at it because the suffering continues there.</p><p>HARLOW: It does continue.</p><p>OK. Let's take a quick look at the markets right now. About an hour into trading and the Dow is off 472 points, largely a sell-off driven by concerns about technology companies. We'll get a live update from the New York Stock Exchange next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:36:55] HARLOW: All right. Welcome back.</p><p>In just hours, a highly anticipated debate takes place for the Mississippi Senate seat, a seat that once looked like a slam dunk for Republicans. That until the Republican candidate, Cindy Hyde Smith, was caught on tape joking about going to a public hanging. In another recording, she said she would welcome certain forms of voter suppression. Here team later said she was joking about that as well. But it has really opened the door for the Democratic candidate Mike Espy, a former Congressman, who if he wins will be the first black senator from Mississippi in over a century. The two face off in a run- off one week from today.</p><p>Adam Ganucheau is with us, political reporter from \"Mississippi Today.\" Good morning. Thank you for being here.</p><p>I'm fascinated by this for so many reasons, including the fact that this is a state that the president won by nearly 18 percent. This should be in the bag for Republicans. It is not, largely because of these controversial comments. Could we see an Alabama-style upset on Tuesday in your state?</p><p>ADAM GANUCHEAU, POLITICAL REPORTER, \"MISSISSIPPI TODAY\": Well, I think Democrats and Republicans both are now thinking it's possible, Poppy. You know, it's a tough thing for a Democrat in Mississippi to win. I guess that's the bottom line. But reports this week have Espy down just five points. And as you said, in Mississippi, that's a really big deal. These two videos that have surfaced in the last week or two, you know, really, I think, have tightened this race and made sort of this national intrigue and brought a lot of out of state cash to Mississippi.</p><p>HARLOW: You know, what I think is interesting is sort of the defense that the Republican candidate, that she and her team are taking here because - I mean, she's essentially taking a page Hyde Smith is out of the Trump playbook. Because Espy called her a walking stereotype who is an embarrassment to the state, those are his words. She responds on Twitter saying, is it still OK to have a sense of humor in America? Isn't it? I mean, are the people of Mississippi laughing?</p><p>GANUCHEAU: Well, you know, it just depends on who you talk to. I will say this. There's not a single Mississippian that either myself or my colleagues have spoken with in the last two weeks who haven't at least heard this video or seen this video.</p><p>HARLOW: Interesting.</p><p>GANUCHEAU: You know, it is sort of, you know, split by racial lines and of course by party lines to some degree, but without exception, the Mississippians I think who are sort of defending this or you know calling this sort of the attack of the politically correct in America or the state of Mississippi, without exception, those are conservative white people. And most of the people who are upset about this are of course African-Americans in Mississippi.</p><p>HARLOW: Which make up about 38 percent of the electorate in Mississippi, African-Americans and let's not forget, Mississippi had more lynchings that are on record, of course, many lynchings were not ever recorded, but more than 600 lynchings on record, making it the highest number in any state in this country. But the way that the Democrat Mike Espy is running is also really interesting to me because he's got some big, you know, Democrat names coming there for him. Democratic Senator Kamala Harris of California, and he's embracing that, but he's also making very clear he's not a liberal, liberal.</p><p>[10:40:04] GANUCHEAU: That's right. You have to remember that, you know, Mike Espy has already made history in Mississippi. He was the first African-American Congressman in the state since reconstruction. If he were elected, he would be, like you said, the first African- American senator elected by popular vote in Mississippi, at least, back to reconstruction. But you know he really has embraced Senator Kamala Harris this week, Senator Cory Booker.</p><p>You know I was in a classroom this week with some African-American students. Elementary school students, and when Espy was there, he sort of talked about, you know, there have only been 10 U.S. Senators in history of the country that are African-American. So you know he's really pushing this. And you know, I think at this point, that's certainly a strategy of theirs, of sort of to you know, talk about that history, how he's already made history and sort of pitch how he could continue that.</p><p>HARLOW: So the president will be there on Monday, trying to make the final push that clearly Hyde Smith's team thinks they need to get over the finish line here for the election on Tuesday. But before you go, there is controversy also that is surrounding Espy. It has to do with lobbying work that he did back in 2010. This was for the Ivory Coast. Of course, the president at the time is now being tried in the ICC for crimes against humanity. There's a controversy over payments that he received. Is that weighing on him?</p><p>GANUCHEAU: I mean, I think it's something he certainly had to deal with. He's faced several, you know sort of questions about that. Espy and Hyde Smith actually tonight are having their first and what looks like their only debate before next week's election. I think you know we can expect that to come up. You know, for Espy's part, he's sort of said, you know, backed out of this. He said that in 2011, and then in 2014, there was a Department of Justice filing that suggested he actually got full payment.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>GANUCHEAU: So, it's something that he's going to have to continue to answer to. It's certainly affected his campaign.</p><p>HARLOW: Sure. You'll have a late night covering that debate. It will be an interesting and important one. Adam, we appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.</p><p>We're going to be right back with a quick check on the markets. The Dow off 420 points at the moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:46:45] HARLOW: All right. This morning we're keeping a very close eye on Wall Street. There's why. You've got the Dow off 414 points, largely driven by a sell-off in tech stocks.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Joining us now from the New York Stock Exchange, CNN business anchor and anchor of \"First Move\" Julia Chatterley. So, Julia, we have seen a fair number of days like this. Several hundred points down, 1 percent, 2 percent. Of course, the market over the course of the year, flat, it's actually below flat at this point. But when you're speaking to traders there, what do they see different in the last several days and with today's fall? Are they concerned this is part of something bigger?</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": That's a great question, Jim, a great view on the show. OK, I give you two things. One, today for the first time all year, we have completely wiped out the gains that the U.S. equity markets have made. So just in terms of sentiment, people are looking at the situation now and going, does this mean it's a good opportunity to get back into the market and buy? Or do you stand back and see how much further this can fall?</p><p>The other thing is, the thing that's been lifting the markets all year has been the big tech stocks, Apple, Amazon, two great examples. And suddenly we're seeing those stocks down 20 percent from the highs. So people are looking at this and going, if they're not going to lead the border markets higher, what is? Those two things I think are very important here. And it's not just about stocks. Oil prices today, they're off 6 percent. There's just a real sense of uncertainty in these markets. And I tie it back to trade and the headlines that we got over the weekend coming into this week. And of course, Poppy, I know you'll know this very well. The Federal Reserve, will Jay Powell continue to hike rates, and the fear remains that he'll overshoot in terms of interest rates. And that weighs growth here too.</p><p>HARLOW: All great points. When you look at the sell-off in tech stocks, though, it's the driver today, as you noted. And it doesn't seem like it's going to be a one-off, Julia, or a just for now. I mean what these tech companies are looking at is what's facing Facebook right now after that damning \"New York Times\" report, and the regulation in Europe with GDRP, and the reality that a reckoning is coming, right? A reckoning is coming for these companies that will fundamentally change the way they have to do business. And that's going to be a prolonged bit of pain for them, no?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more. I mean we've had Tim Cook this week saying, guys, get ready. More regulation is coming. You're going to have to get used to it. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has been under the spotlight for the last few months. We have seen that stock punished. Even the ones that we thought were the strongest like Apple. They're having reports now that they're struggling to sell iPhones to the size that they were hoping to. So all around, there's individual stories that mean they're going to be challenged going forward. And it's a real headache. You know and I take it back to trade. A lot of people I'm speaking to right now are saying when you look at the tensions between Vice President Mike Pence at the weekend with Xi Jinping, there's not going to be a solution here either anytime soon. It's tough.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Julia Chatterley, we know we're going to keep coming back to you there as we follow this. Thanks very much.</p><p>Coming up next, a stunning new CNN investigation uncovers hundreds of mishaps involving armed Federal Air Marshals and their firearms.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[10:54:25] SCIUTTO: Loaded guns left behind in bathrooms. Accidental misfires onboard. Officers hired to keep you safe on airplanes are now accused in a range of gun misuse cases.</p><p>HARLOW: This is all according to the CNN investigation that our colleague Drew Griffin did that uncovered more than 200 alleged gun mishaps by Federal Air Marshals. Our senior investigative correspondent Drew Griffin is here. This is stunning, Drew.</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: You know, guys, just last month, yet another air marshal committed suicide. We've reported extensively on these suicides by the air marshals in the past. It's what prompted us to ask the federal government for every record involving mishaps and air marshals. This is what we found.</p><p>[10:55:05] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN (voice-over): These documents released to CNN through a Freedom of Information Act request reveal more than 200 cases of alleged misconduct by Federal Air Marshals involving firearms. Men and women supposedly well trained to use their weapons in one of the most dangerous environments. Misplacing, misfiring. Even accidentally and not so accidentally shooting themselves. Documents released to CNN include 19 accidental discharges, including an air marshal who caused a gunshot wound to his right foot. Another accidentally discharged his firearm in a hotel room, hitting a television in the adjoining room. More than 70 cases of air marshals losing weapons, three times air marshals have left their service weapons in an airplane's bathroom. They've left weapons in restrooms, bars, even a bed, bath, and beyond in New Jersey. In at least 13 cases, alcohol was involved.</p><p>After releasing the documents, the Federal Air Marshal Service invited CNN to the Air Marshal Training Academy outside of Atlantic City, New Jersey, where new air marshals are taught how to handle their weapons and top instructor Daniel Kowal admitted the reports are embarrassing.</p><p>DANIEL KOWAL, SUPERVISORY AIR MARSHAL: We look at what was the underlying cause, what happened? If and when training failed, how and why did it fail? How do we plug that gap? How do we fix that? Our goal as the training department is to strive for zero percent error.</p><p>GRIFFIN: It's hard to compare if air marshals are more or less dangerous with weapons than other law enforcement agencies because the number of air marshals is classified. But former air marshals tell CNN any mishap is unacceptable because their agents operate at 34,000 feet.</p><p>HENRY PRESTON, FORMER AIR MARSHAL TRAINING INSTRUCTOR: There's no backup. You have got to take care of business. And you got to do it very quickly and efficiently.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Henry Preston, who spent 10 years in the service, says he observed a decline in weapons training and practice, year by year. Inconsistencies he said, that could contribute to mistakes.</p><p>PRESTON: They need additional training. There's no doubt about it.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Oddly, three of the apparent mishaps occurred during firearms training. In one case, an instructor allegedly threw training bullets called Simunition into an open flame. They exploded, and one staff member was struck in the face by flying debris. Problems are nothing new to the controversial air marshal service. CNN has previously reported agents have continually complained about low morale, low staffing, grueling hours.</p><p>A 2012 sleep study obtained by CNN shows 75 percent of domestic air marshals were flying while sleep deficient. That study found that lack of sleep puts them at greater incidents of serious errors. Critics question if air marshals are even necessary. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general slammed the air marshal service and said its contribution to aviation transportation security is questionable. Ohio state professor John Mueller, who studies the efficiencies of security measures, says nearly $1 billion agency is almost worthless.</p><p>JOHN MUELLER, POLITICAL SCIENTIST, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY: Federal Air Marshals simply don't pass muster in terms of cost/benefit analysis. They deliver about 5 cents or maybe 10 cents of benefit for every dollar that's spent on them.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Now, the revelation that at least 200 cases where agents made dangerous mistakes is yet another strike against the Federal Air Marshals program.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GRIFFIN: The TSA tells us the air marshals are trained to the highest levels. The problem, Poppy and Jim, is the air marshals we have been talking to say that's just not true. And in 2016, the government accountability office said the record keeping is so bad that it's really hard to tell if these agents are trained and retrained to proper specifications. TSA insists that's all fixed now.</p><p>SCIUTTO: The air marshals themselves are identifying this is a problem. I'm curious, just to be clear. Did any of these mishaps happen in the air with passengers onboard? Were passengers put in danger?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Several cases where these guns that were left in airplane bathrooms were found by the passengers themselves. That's how these guns were discovered. So the answer is yes. Does that put a passenger in danger? Well, I guess it depends on which passenger picks it up. But I would say absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm struck by so much in your report, but especially the record keeping. The record keeping was so messy that they don't really have the ability to say were these people trained up to snuff or not. How can that be?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Poppy, I have been reporting on the air marshal service for 10 years. This is a service that got ramped up right after 9/11. I believe ill thought out and it's been a mess ever since. And since we've hardened the cockpit doors, many people just say we don't need these guys sitting on planes.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Interesting question. Thanks very much for joining us today. I'm Jim Sciutto.</p><p>HARLOW: I'm Poppy Harlow. We'll see you back here tomorrow morning. \"At This Hour\" with Kate Bolduan starts now.</p><p>[Byline: Poppy Harlow, Jim Sciutto, Paul Vercammen, Julia Chatterley, Drew Griffin] [Guest: Adam Ganucheau] [High: Rain in the forecast tomorrow for Northern California.

Others are delaying plans to go public. Hot new technologies like Bitcoin have been struggling.With all the nervous chatter out there -- Where is this going? What's next? -- I called on <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen, </nameText></person>who has lived through a bubble or two (or three).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, has been at the epicenter of the technology business here for two decades. In the early 1990s, he was a co-founder of one of the first major web browsers, Netscape. He went on to start Ning, an early social site. Now, in addition to being voluble on Twitter, he sits on the board of Facebook, eBay and Hewlett-Packard.</p><p>I got 28 minutes with him. But Mr. Andreessen speaks so quickly, it felt like an hour and a half.</p><p>Saying ''bubble'' to a venture capitalist around here is like saying ''homework'' to a teenager. They roll their eyes and try to shoo you away. So rather than ask if we are in the middle of another -- ahem -- bubble, I asked Mr. Andreessen why some young companies can't seem to raise all the money they want.</p><p>His answer: conditions ebb and flow. And right now, they are ebbing for some companies. But for others, capital is still available.</p><p>''We have not seen any pullback so far on private investment,'' Mr. Andreessen said. ''Actually, what we're seeing is more of the opposite right now. We're seeing a lot more institutional money -- in particular from the hedge fund world -- crossing over'' into tech investing.</p><p>But what about companies that can't find their way to the stock market, like Box and Square?</p><p>Mr. Andreessen pointed to 1997 and 1998, when the market for initial public stock offerings was briefly derailed by the Asian financial crisis. Before long, investor interest revved up again, and the Nasdaq stock market was flying high. (A few years later, of course, it came crashing down.)</p><p>So if a start-up can't go public just now, it's no big deal. ''The nature of the public market is that it is manic depressive,'' Mr. Andreessen said. ''It gets excited, it gets depressed.''</p><p>Speaking of feeling down, I asked Mr. Andreessen a question I often hear from people outside Silicon Valley: Why can't other places build their own valley-style tech hubs? People in cities ranging from Dublin to Berlin to New York often ask what they are doing wrong.</p><p>Mr. Andreessen said new valleys will eventually emerge. But they won't be Silicon Valley copycats.</p><p>Over the past couple of years, venture firms have invested in start-ups in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and all over China. Los Angeles, for example, is home to Snapchat, Tinder, Whisper, Oculus VR and Beats, some of the big tech stories of the year. Mr. Andreessen said another hot place is Atlanta, the home of Georgia Tech.</p><p>But he offers a caveat.</p><p>''My personal view is that Silicon Valley will continue to take a disproportionate share of the No. 1 positions in great new markets, and I think that's just a reflection that the fact that the valley works as well as it does,'' Mr. Andreessen said.</p><p>There is a caveat to his caveat.</p><p>In Mr. Andreessen's view, there shouldn't be 50 Silicon Valleys. Instead, there should be 50 different kinds of Silicon Valley. For example, there could be Biotech Valley, a Stem Cell Valley, a 3-D Printing Valley or a Drone Valley. As he noted, there are huge regulatory hurdles in many of these fields. If a city wanted to spur innovation around drones, for instance, it might have to remove any local legal barriers to flying unnamed aircraft.</p><p>So what kind of valley would <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>build? He is a big believer in digital currencies like Bitcoin, as well as in virtual reality. He says enterprises like Bitcoin will change the world on the scale that web browsers did. And before long, virtual reality will be, well, reality.</p><p>Don't believe him? Mr. Andreessen recalled similar skepticism in May 1994 when he was showing media and telecommunications executives this bizarre development called a web browser.</p><p>''They pretty much told us we were out of minds and to go away,'' he said. Five years later, Netscape was sold to AOL for $4.2 billion.</p><p>Finally, I couldn't end my discussion without asking him about Twitter. Over the past several months Mr. Andreessen has become a mantle on the social network, known for his long stream of tweets that have become known as the ''<person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>Tweetstorm.''</p><p>So Mr. Andreessen, why the long tweets?</p><p>''My view is that 140 characters doesn't make sense anymore,'' he said. ''If it was me, I'd immediately raise the limit to 300 or 400 characters.''</p><p>But if that doesn't happen, he's incredibly bullish on the service just the way it is. ''The counterargument is that there is magic to the limitation,'' he said, laying out a number of virtues around the limited character lengths. ''If Twitter doesn't adapt, I would not view them as being stupid. I just hope they change it because it would be a lot better for me.''</p><p>This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen </nameText></person>is a big believer in digital currencies like Bitcoin, and in virtual reality.

Along with Brazilian growth falling below the year before, the FT\u2019s forecasting team got those predictions wrong for 2019, though Philip Stephens last year admitted he offered his forecast that Brexit would be reversed \u201cas much in hope as expectation\u201d. </p><p>Though the world may seem ever more unpredictable, four wrong answers was an improvement on our dismal eight the year before. And aside from Brexit, readers in our annual competition generally made the same mistakes we did \u2014 more than 70 per cent of you got the same three questions wrong. </p><p>For a third straight year, though, the top-scoring readers beat the FT. Three tied on 19 correct answers out of 20. Many congratulations to Rowan Coorens from Amsterdam who won on the tie-breaker. To have a shot at beating the FT for 2020, provide your answers to the 20 questions and tiebreaker below, and submit your real name and email. Happy New Year! <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Neil Buckley</emphasis><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://survey.ft.com/jfe/form/SV_8pPsl8CaQ2b9YUJ\"> FT readers: submit your predictions for 2020</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Boris Johnson agree a trade deal with the EU?</emphasis><br/>Yes. That is his aim and he has a good chance. By announcing the deadline will be set in law, however, the prime minister has set his sights low. It will be near-impossible to negotiate much beyond a bare bones deal covering trade in goods during the time available. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Boris_Johnson\"> Mr Johnson</url> has emphasised his aim is to remove tariffs and quotas on all goods trade. The EU27 also have an interest in such a deal; collectively they have a large surplus in trade in goods. But there will be pitfalls. Watch out for French insistence that fisheries be included in any deal and that Britain give assurances that it will not seek to undercut EU standards on labour and the environment. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Philip Stephens</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Britain\u2019s Labour party return to electability?</emphasis><br/>No. Labour\u2019s outgoing leaders have recommended a \u201cperiod of reflection\u201d on the way forward for the UK\u2019s main opposition party after its worst election defeat since 1935. Those still in the party who feared or warned that having Jeremy Corbyn in charge would end this way \u2014 and those moderates rushing to rejoin in order to have a vote in choosing the new leader and deputy \u2014 may be disappointed, however. Recrimination and factional battles will take a long time to play out. So far, the leadership hopefuls are being careful not to repudiate the sharply leftward journey under Mr Corbyn \u2014 to win, they may have to promise much of the same. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Miranda Green</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Angela Merkel\u2019s grand coalition collapse?</emphasis><br/>Yes. Germany\u2019s chancellor will struggle to keep her \u201cGroKo\u201d intact because junior partners the Social Democrats are lurching leftwards. New SPD leaders Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken were forced by senior party figures and ministers to soften their anti-coalition rhetoric at the recent party conference. But they were elected on a plan to leave, and their vow to boost spending will clash with Ms Merkel\u2019s fiscally conservative CDU. The SPD might seek to avoid snap elections, fearing a drubbing, and allow a minority government until 2021 when Ms Merkel retires. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Anne-Sylvaine Chassany</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Matteo Salvini come back to power in Italy?</emphasis><br/>Yes. After bungling an attempt to trigger early elections in August and finding himself locked out of office, the leader of the rightwing nationalist League is riding high in the polls once again. The coalition that took power four months ago is proving to be as querulous and ineffective as the one Mr Salvini terminated. Defeat for the left in its stronghold of Emilia-Romagna in regional elections in late January will send the government into a tailspin. Even a new anti-Salvini protest movement known as the Sardines reaffirms his pre-eminence. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ben Hall</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Donald Trump win the popular vote in November\u2019s election?</emphasis><br/>No. In 2016, Hillary Clinton took almost 3m more votes than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/search?q=donald%20trump\"> Mr Trump </url>yet still lost the electoral college. That margin will be even wider in 2020 yet could still result in Mr Trump\u2019s re-election. Many of the most energised anti-Trump voters live in already-Democratic states like California and New York. Their votes could thus be \u201cwasted\u201d. The real battle will again come down to the smaller mid-western states that delivered victory to Mr Trump last time. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ed Luce</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will the US go into recession?</emphasis><br/>No \u2014 though the question haunts the markets, the White House and US corporate leaders; half of chief financial officers told a recent Duke University survey they expect a recession over the next year. It is easy to see why. No other advanced economy bar Australia has defied the business cycle for so long, and there are signs nervous US companies have been cutting capital spending. However, consumers have remained surprisingly buoyant in 2019. There is good reason for this to continue in 2020 with unemployment still at rock-bottom and jobs being created for the poorest parts of the economy. That, on balance, should keep the economy growing. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gillian Tett</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will India regain its status as the fastest growing large economy?</emphasis><br/>No. India\u2019s GDP growth has collapsed from 8 per cent to 4.5 per cent in the last year and a half due to severe problems in the banking and financial system and the once-booming real estate sector. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government insists India\u2019s economic woes are cyclical and has no credible plan to tackle the challenges. Growth may recover slightly from its current six-year low but India will struggle to regain enough momentum to outpace even a slowing China. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amy Kazmin</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will there be a war with Iran?</emphasis><br/>No. Concerns about a conflict between the US, its Arab allies and Iran have simmered for months as the Trump administration has ramped up his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy against the Islamic republic. Tehran has responded with provocative moves \u2014 downing a US drone, seizing a British vessel and allegedly attacking Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry. Yet despite the belligerent rhetoric, Mr Trump has displayed reluctance to take muscular action. All protagonists insist they do not want war. And with an election looming, Mr Trump is even less likely to want America embroiled in a conflict. Any miscalculation, however, risks inadvertently triggering a broader conflagration. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andrew England</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will South African debt hit junk status?</emphasis><br/>Yes. The country\u2019s sovereign debt rating has been hanging by a thread with only Moody\u2019s among the top three agencies rating it above junk. In November, Moody\u2019s put it on negative watch saying the government lacked the political capital to implement reforms. The economy has stalled and South African Airways placed into bankruptcy protection. Eskom, the biggest state-owned enterprise, has imposed growth-sapping blackouts and cannot repay $30bn in debt. Tito Mboweni, finance minister, will have to pull out all the stops to persuade Moody\u2019s things are salvageable. The odds must be against him. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">David Pilling</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will the protests that have shaken Latin America continue?</emphasis><br/>Yes. Underlying causes of the anger \u2014 weak growth, serious inequality and perceptions that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/latin-america\"> governments</url> are ignoring many people\u2019s needs \u2014 will not go away. 2019\u2019s upheavals did not respect political colours, hitting market-friendly governments in Chile, Colombia and Ecuador but also felling a leftist president in Bolivia. In 2020, Argentina\u2019s new Peronist president may enjoy a brief honeymoon, but there are serious unresolved crises in most of the Andean nations and Mexico could be vulnerable if its populist leader Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador proves unable to control rising violence and restart the stalled economy. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Stott</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron engineer a \u2018reset\u2019 with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia? </emphasis><br/>No. The French president has made ambitious overtures to bring <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/37361dd6-0de5-45a8-b8b9-29184b1b4bc4\">Russia</url> back into the fold. But the path to any broader reset runs through a peace deal in Ukraine \u2014 which is unlikely. Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky was elected in part on a pledge to end the simmering conflict in the country\u2019s east. He cannot agree, however, to Moscow\u2019s demands to grant \u201cspecial status\u201d to the Donbass \u2014 which Kyiv fears would enable Russia to maintain leverage through its proxies there, making the region a kind of cancer inside Ukraine. More limited resumption of dialogue with Russia is possible, though. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Neil Buckley</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will we see meaningful regulation of big tech?</emphasis><br/>No \u2014 at least not in the huge US market. The path towards the most likely regulation \u2014 a privacy bill \u2014 is fraught. Democrats want tough rules, and Republicans favour weaker regulation (which won\u2019t get through the House). Meanwhile, the US has pushed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/6a112bc2-de49-4956-be12-c835b7eab4a6\"> big tech</url> legal loopholes, such as a provision that tech companies are not treated as publishers, into the USMCA trade deal with Mexico and Canada, and is trying to make it part of any new transatlantic deals. The EU\u2019s digital supremo Margrethe Vestager wants to connect and strengthen privacy and antitrust regulation. But a precedent-setting case will take years to complete. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rana Foroohar</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Disney+ change the game in streaming?</emphasis><br/>Yes. The digital video services Apple, Disney and HBO unveiled in 2019 ensure that streaming will remain the dominant force reshaping media in 2020. First among them is Disney+, chief executive Bob Iger\u2019s gamble that viewers will pay up for franchises like Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar. Analysts expected it to find up to 12m users by late 2020 but its blockbuster launch wrongfooted them. Disney+ should instead blow through 20m, rattling larger incumbents and proving content truly is king when the Magic Kingdom also controls its distribution. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Uber become profitable in 2020?</emphasis><br/>No \u2014 but expect to hear a lot about \u201cadjusted\u201d profits in various parts of the company. Uber knows investors want proof the ride-hailing business can break even after breathtaking losses in 2019. It has promised to be profitable \u2014 but only on an adjusted basis \u2014 by 2021. Private backers were happy to fund expansion at subsidised rates. Public markets are not. After listing in May, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/dba27910-ff66-4433-a665-4fbcfd15446f\"> Uber</url> shares have lost a third of their value. Costs are being trimmed; sales are rising. But without exiting food delivery or launching driverless cars it is unclear whether Uber will ever make a profit. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Elaine Moore</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will China become world leader in 5G telecoms?</emphasis><br/>Yes. China\u2019s lead in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f6c789f3-5224-4701-b5bb-1d07e2389dbf\"> 5G telecoms</url> \u2014 superfast wireless connectivity that will be the nervous system of the Internet of Things \u2014 will be obvious in almost all arenas by the year-end. Measured by 5G base stations installed, China will surge far ahead of other countries. On the number of contracts to provide 5G services overseas, Huawei will pull ahead of competition from Ericsson, despite the US push to curb the Chinese telecoms group because of national security fears. And in 5G smartphone sales, Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo and other Chinese makers will far outstrip Apple, Samsung and others. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">James Kynge</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will vaping be banned?</emphasis><br/>No. Vaping of nicotine in e-cigarettes is safer than smoking tobacco, though it carries some risks. The deaths of 48 people in the US \u2014 some of whom inhaled THC oils for a cannabis high \u2014 and vaping by school students of brands such as Juul have put pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to get tough. But science indicates that switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes as a means of quitting saves lives. While countries such as India have rushed into making vaping illegal, do not expect a blanket US ban. Instead, it will move closer to European countries by tightening marketing and limiting e-cigarette flavours. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Gapper</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will global carbon emissions fall?</emphasis><br/>No. Emissions from burning fossil fuels have been growing 0.9 per cent a year on average since 2010 and there are many signs of another rise in 2020. If global GDP grows as forecast we are likely to see rising use of energy, which still mostly comes from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/24ad2c58-14fb-4217-b6f7-7ef88ac51375\"> fossil fuels</url>. Some of the fastest growing economies will again be big users of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, not least China. It emits more CO2 than the US and EU combined, and Beijing\u2019s efforts to stimulate the economy and boost energy security could easily bolster coal use.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Pilita Clark</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Brent crude prices end the year above $65 a barrel?</emphasis><br/>No. Saudi Arabia led Opec, and allies including Russia, in a recent round of production cuts at the end of 2019, propping up <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/companies/oil-gas\"> oil</url> prices above $65 a barrel. But for crude to remain here throughout 2020 will require producers to stick to their share of curbs, with the kingdom taking the heaviest burden for a prolonged period. Russia\u2019s ongoing compliance with the deal is under scrutiny. While growth in US shale supply growth is forecast to weaken in 2020, production from other non-Opec countries will expand. And Donald Trump in an election year will be keen to enlist the support of his Saudi partners in ensuring prices do not escalate. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Anjli Raval</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will the three-decade bond rally finally come to an end?</emphasis><br/>No \u2014 though it is right to ask the question. In summer 2019, the asset class experienced a storm of buying that fired up bond prices to the point where $17tn of debt around the world delivered buyers a guaranteed loss. The storm has abated, but still $12tn of bonds are effectively in the deep freeze. Now, investors\u2019 instinct to buy debt on any dip remains extremely robust. We may not see a repeat of the wild summer of 2019 any time soon, but a market rush to the exit seems unlikely as long as central banks stand ready to offer support. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katie Martin</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Europe\u2019s banks keep slashing jobs? </emphasis><br/>Yes. Little suggests 2019\u2019s tough operating environment will change soon. Lenders are being squeezed by low or negative interest rates, weak investment banking revenues and slowing economic growth. Banks are also braced for the Basel IV rules, which from 2022 will increase <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/77606738-b8cb-445e-8074-b13d1df45bea\"> banks\u2019 capital requirements</url>. By December, banks across Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland and the UK had collectively announced more than 60,000 job cuts. HSBC will keep up its cost-cutting drive under interim chief executive Noel Quinn. In Italy, other banks could follow UniCredit, which is cutting 8,000. More jobs could go in the UK, especially if Brexit hits the economy hard. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sylvia Pfeifer</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tiebreaker: How many gold medals will Japan win at the Tokyo Olympics?</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-078d232e269e11ea9a4f963f0ec7e134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV7-3H01-DXP9-92XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2403\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Asset and Liability Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRBNTJEQ0ZBMzU4NDJENEE3MzQ1MDgyNTYxQjU3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYwNzU1MEY2MzcyNDc1QUEzMjIyMkVGNDdBRTkxOUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Investment Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzI1QTAxRjkxOUUxNDBFREE3RUQxM0Y1OEY3NUVGOTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYwNzU1MEY2MzcyNDc1QUEzMjIyMkVGNDdBRTkxOUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Reforms will likely include data-handling transparency, stepped-up digital security and more consumer rights, such as the ability to ask for deletion of personal data.</p><p>The Federal Trade Comm. is making moves to study tech markets and uncover unfair practices. Lawmakers are mulling giving the agency more power to levy fines for mishandling data or to track mergers after they are OK'd to see how things are panning out.</p><p>Who's president in 2021 will play a big role. A Democrat would pick tougher antitrust regulators, though the courts would stymie many of their lawsuits aimed at pushing an aggressive antitrust stance.</p><p>In the states, digital privacy laws will spread. Calif.'s sweeping rules go into effect in Jan. Other states are writing similar bills. State attorneys general in both parties are readying a crackdown on Big Tech's power.</p><p>Tech companies are planning costly changes to many business practices to fend off the most onerous federal regulations and thwart future antitrust actions.</p><p>Expect heavier spending on security and privacy. Facebook, for instance, is rolling out encryption on its messaging apps to protect private conversations. Facebook, Google and others will give users greater control over their personal data.</p><p>Look for stronger efforts to remove violent videos and dangerous hoaxes with thousands more human moderators and better artificial intelligence software.</p><p>Online platforms will play nicer with small and midsize firms. Facebook and Google will offer more-accurate ad tracking tools. Amazon will give small sellers some reprieve from certain restrictions. Microsoft will offer free or cheap AI tools.</p><p>And there will be sharper focus on ethical standards for AI, biometrics, etc.</p><p>Global scrutiny is ramping up, too. The European Union has whacked Google with billions of dollars in fines, and more are coming. The U.K., Japan, South Korea and other nations are targeting tech's market dominance and its many bad practices.</p><p>Despite talk of the insurmountable lead of today's largest tech companies...</p><p>We still think disruption is possible. Competition is fierce around the globe, and companies are entering new markets. Apple is pushing into video streaming. Facebook will launch digital payments. Firms in other sectors are on high alert, too.</p><p>Even today's giants can't rest on their laurels as technology races ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STATE BY STATE</emphasis></p><p>New England's economy is slowing. But 2019 should still be a decent year.</p><p>N.H. faces a few clouds after a banner 2018. A rock-bottom jobless rate of 2.4% testifies to the Granite State's strong local economy, but also makes it hard for employers to find the workers they need. Still, job growth in N.H. will hit 1.2% this year...the fastest in New England and above the region's 0.9% average rate.</p><p>Mass. remains a regional leader, thanks to its robust high-tech industry centered in Boston and underpinned by world-class universities such as MIT. Biotech and pharmaceutical companies like Allergan and Novo Nordisk are hiring, as are Verizon, Google and Apple. But Boston's housing market is still very tight.</p><p>Maine is also in reasonably good shape, though again, its limited supply of workers is making life hard for employers. Deaths outnumber births in Maine, and state officials are desperate to attract folks from elsewhere. Tourism is strong, and the Bath Iron Works is benefiting from brisk orders to upgrade Navy vessels.</p><p>Conn. can look forward to a second year of economic growth after two years of contraction prior to 2018. General Dynamics subsidiary Electric Boat is benefiting from orders for submarines built at its Groton shipyard. High tech and health care are also doing well in the Constitution State. But the local housing market is soft.</p><p>Construction continues to power R.I.'s economy, though at a slower pace than last year. Providence and other cities are seeing a building boom as state officials hope to lure start-up firms and their workers from neighboring states and overseas. They are hoping to rejuvenate the Ocean State, which has a small and aging population.</p><p>Vt. is holding up, despite a shortage of workers and a population in decline. The local aerospace industry is supporting thousands of high-paying jobs. GE Aviation just won a lucrative helicopter engine contract...more work for its Rutland plant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GLOBAL ECONOMY</emphasis></p><p>Europe's economy is looking even weaker than when we warned about it a few weeks ago. Manufacturing in Germany, the Continent's powerhouse, has fallen to its slowest pace in more than six years, as global trade flows decline. That news has spooked investors around the world and sent bond yields tumbling.</p><p>Europe should still be able to avoid an outright recession this year.</p><p>But it can't do much better than that. For the European Union as a whole, figure on an expansion of 1.4%...and that's if it doesn't take a fresh turn for the worse.</p><p>Note the mounting problems weighing on the Continent: A new recession in Italy. The never-ending drama of Brexit, which has put much investment on hold. And the risk of continued fallout from the trade fight between the U.S. and China, which has hobbled the latter's economy and sapped European exports to Asia.</p><p>It's crunch time for approving the White House's North American trade pact, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which the three countries agreed on as a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement. All three countries must ratify the new deal in their respective legislatures, but the U.S. Congress isn't sold yet. Expect the Trump administration to press reluctant Democrats hard by pointing out that the new deal calls for more U.S.-made components in products in order to qualify for duty-free status...a potential win for America's labor unions.</p><p>We expect the president to prevail. But it won't be an easy fight for him. Mexico and Canada are chafing at continued U.S. tariffs on their steel and aluminum and are pushing Washington to drop those duties as a condition for OK'ing USMCA.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCE</emphasis></p><p>Note the growing popularity of green bonds...mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and others. Apartment landlords with mortgages owned by Fannie Mae get a reduced mortgage rate and additional financing in return for making energy- and water-saving upgrades to their rental properties. Fannie raises capital for the program by selling bonds to investors...$52 billion to date. For landlords, the upgrades are expected to pay for themselves in six years, on average.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ENERGY</emphasis></p><p>The U.S. will ship less oil by truck and rail as new oil pipelines come on line in West Texas...good news for exporters, who will pay less to ship their oil. But bad for railroad and trucking companies, who will miss the top-dollar business.</p><p>In Canada, new pipelines are largely a pipe dream. The Keystone XL project remains on hold after a series of legal setbacks in the U.S. And the government of Alberta recently invested in new tanker cars, a sign of continued reliance on rail.</p><p>Mexico will also need more infrastructure...whether pipeline, rail or port... to support its growing demand for U.S. refined petroleum in the coming decade.</p><p>Uncle Sam will fund more research into technology to lower carbon emissions. The Dept. of Energy is granting up to $30 million for research and development of carbon-capture usage and storage. The process involves separating carbon dioxide from other industrial gases for safe storage before it can reach Earth's atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon capture has garnered rare bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.</p><p>And existing tech has been effective. The DOE-funded Petra Nova project can capture about 1.4 million metric tons of CO[2] each year, equal to the emissions of 350,000 cars. So far, only 17 large-scale carbon capture plants exist worldwide.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AG</emphasis></p><p>Even as the financial picture in farm country continues to worsen...</p><p>U.S. agriculture has managed to avoid a full-blown crisis akin to the one that hit farmers in the 1980s, when spiraling debt unleashed a wave of bankruptcies.</p><p>One reason: Stable land values, which have kept farm balance sheets in check, despite rising levels of debt. Real estate accounts for roughly 80% of farm-sector assets...a crucial source of equity for cash-strapped farmers.</p><p>Lower interest rates have also helped by making loan repayments easier.</p><p>But signs of trouble are multiplying as more farmers default on loans and grapple with trade tensions, low prices and spring flooding. Rural banks plan to raise collateral requirements this year in response to lower farm income.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WORLD</emphasis></p><p>Embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a powerful ally:</p><p>Donald Trump. The U.S. president enjoys immense popularity in Israel, thanks to his staunch support for the Jewish state. While criticized in Washington, Trump earned plaudits in Jerusalem after moving the U.S. embassy there in 2018, and for his decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the disputed Golan Heights.</p><p>Netanyahu hopes Trump's support will help him win reelection in April, despite corruption charges that could land the Israeli leader in jail. His campaign has even featured Trump's picture on billboards and other political advertisements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HIGHER ED</emphasis></p><p>Colleges aren't keen on a White House plan to protect free speech on campus.</p><p>A recent executive order threatens to withhold federal research dollars from schools that stifle students' First Amendment rights. The order follows attempts by several college administrators to cancel speeches by controversial public figures.</p><p>Enforcement will be tricky, and officials are still working out the details. Twelve executive agencies will be tasked with carrying out Trump's executive order.</p><p>Many states...both red and blue...have passed college free-speech laws. The list includes Ariz., Colo., Ga., La. and Wash. Expect others to follow suit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIPLTR-ForecastsforExecutivesandInvestorsMarch2019Vol96No13</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIPLTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X22-FSV1-JCBK-Y2NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278342</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.

Reduce or scrap their legal immunity for the flood of content that is uploaded by their users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TECH</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Websites received liability protection in 1996. Congress wanted to encourage platforms to moderate content and remove objectionable posts... violent material, hate speech, etc...without the prospect of being slammed with lawsuits over users' material.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The move was pivotal in creating today's web by ushering in an era of popular, user-driven sites... Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Wikipedia, Yelp, etc.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But after a series of Big Tech missteps...</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties want a redo of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the brief section that some say \"created the internet.\"</p><p>Republicans are leading the charge, saying Facebook and others have too much power over speech and discriminate against conservatives. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) wants legal immunity that is premised on neutrality: Popular web platforms would have to prove to regulators that their policies for deleting posts and curating content were politically neutral.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly mulling taking action: The Federal Trade Comm. and Federal Communications Comm. would vet the policies of websites. An executive order of that kind would be hit with lawsuits and likely fail.</p><p>Democrats, too, question legal protections unless web giants do a lot more to fight misinformation, terrorist content, foreign election meddling, harassment, etc.</p><p>The legal protections that online platforms enjoy today won't be fully eliminated.</p><p>But changes around the edges are coming. Among the most likely ideas: Make sites shed more light on how they personalize content, delete certain material or ban users. Hold web platforms more accountable for some moneymaking content, such as YouTube's business partnerships with outside video makers. Require websites to be more accountable for the ads they run or for posts that users pay to promote.</p><p>Lawmakers recently narrowed protections of Section 230 for posted material relating to sex trafficking, the first major change since 1996. Other notable exceptions already in the law include intellectual property and federal criminal prosecutions. Otherwise, sites aren't on the hook for hosted content, as traditional publishers are.</p><p>The talk in Washington will jolt Big Tech into taking major voluntary action in a rush to avoid a disruption of its business models. Expect more transparency in how behind-the-scenes decisions happen...why one sees a recommended video, for instance, or how to appeal if a post is removed. Users will get more control, too.</p><p>Lawmakers will lean on rhetoric for now, as legislation seems a way off.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRADE</emphasis></p><p>Just how bad are U.S.-China trade relations now as the tariffs pile up?</p><p>The two sides have even disagreed about whether they're on speaking terms. In the wake of the latest hike in duties on each other's imports, President Trump said that Chinese officials called to restart talks, only for Beijing to say otherwise.</p><p>Dialogue will start up again at some point. Just don't expect any breakthrough ending the trade war between the world's top two economies. The issues they differ on, such as protecting American intellectual property and giving U.S. firms more access to the Chinese market, are too thorny for a deal to happen before next Nov.'s elections.</p><p>Europe's export-oriented economies will continue to suffer. The hit to China caused by U.S. tariffs means shrinking demand for capital equipment and other goods that Germany, in particular, ships to China. Europe's economic woes are far from over.</p><p>Sizable U.S. oil exports to China have dodged a tariff bullet. For now. Beijing was planning to apply duties to imports of U.S. crude, effective Sept. 1. But China is holding off on those and other duties for now in a bid to defuse tensions. Not long ago, China was the third-largest buyer of America's expanding oil bounty, behind South Korea and Canada, though its imports of U.S. crude are off 63% this year.</p><p>U.S. natural gas is already a casualty of the trade war. China ranks second among importers of liquefied natural gas, but its intake of U.S. LNG is down 76%.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE ECONOMY</emphasis></p><p>Expect factory activity to keep weakening as manufacturers curb production because of the uncertainties created by the trade situation. Inventory growth is slowing, a sign that manufacturers expect demand for their products to decline. Some wholesalers and retailers will keep stocking up for now in order to beat hikes in tariffs on Chinese imports, but that process figures to run its course fairly soon. And declining inventories subtract from GDP, to the tune of a tenth of a point in 2019 and a quarter of a point next year, at a time when economic growth is already slowing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CREDIT</emphasis></p><p>Interest rates show little sign of reversing their recent slide. How low they'll go is hard to say, but it's likely that the yield on the 10-year Treasury note won't return to 2% anytime soon. It now trades near 1.5%, versus 2018's peak of 3.25%. Even at this low level, foreign investors who face negative rates at home are buying.</p><p>Watch for the average rate on 30-year mortgages to dip below 3.5%. The rate for a 15-year loan: Below 3%. Yields on corporate and municipal debt will fall more, too, a sign that investors are seeking safety but aren't alarmed about the economy just yet.</p><p>But note that rates on credit cards are the highest in more than 20 years: 17.14% on average as of May. That's partly a product of the Federal Reserve's hikes on its short-term rate, which card lenders use as a benchmark for their own rates.</p><p>The cost of plastic won't decline much, even as the Fed reverses course. Some major lenders have dialed back their card rates a bit this summer, but in general, they won't be quick to pass interest savings on to their customers. (Imagine that.)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTING</emphasis></p><p>When considering international stocks, don't overlook Australian shares, say the editors of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kiplinger's Personal Finance</emphasis> magazine. Economic growth down under is robust. Many Australian stocks sport low prices and high dividends.</p><p>Among funds, consider the iShares MSCI Australia exchange-traded fund, a good way to gain broad exposure to the Aussie economy. It's weighted toward banks and other financial firms, and yields much more than the S&amp;P 500 index's 2% payout.</p><p>Also check out Aberdeen Australia Equity, a closed-end fund that trades at a discount to the market value of its holdings, making it potentially undervalued.</p><p>And First Trust Australia Alphadex, a specialty ETF that invests in stocks that look promising but that aren't easy for American investors to buy directly.</p><p>Individual Australian stocks worth a look: Westpac Banking. BHP Group, the mining giant. Retailer Woolworths Group (available through specialty brokers).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE WORLD</emphasis></p><p>U.S. foreign policy is suffering setbacks all over the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>The White House is struggling to reboot nuclear talks with North Korea, dealing instead with continued complaints and missile launches from Pyongyang. The North Koreans also canceled peace talks with their South Korean counterparts.</p><p>South Korea is in an escalating feud with Japan, another American ally. What began as a trade dispute has become a national security issue after Seoul formally withdrew from a military-intelligence-sharing agreement with Tokyo.</p><p>What will the Trump administration do? On North Korea, nothing...</p><p>For now. The president has mostly ignored Pyongyang's demands for sanctions relief and its missile tests, so long as they don't threaten the U.S.</p><p>Expect Pyongyang to up the ante to get President Trump's attention. Tensions will rise if North Korea crosses Trump's redline: Testing a missile capable of reaching the U.S. Don't be surprised if Kim Jong Un takes advantage of the U.S.-China trade war by convincing Beijing to go easy on sanctions.</p><p>On South Korea, the U.S. is attempting to conduct damage control.</p><p>But the situation will worsen before it improves. The list of issues dividing Seoul and Tokyo is long. Some of them go back decades, even centuries.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MIDDLE EAST</emphasis></p><p>Tensions between the U.S. and Iran appear to finally be easing after months of escalation following America's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal. Mediation by French President Emmanuel Macron has both sides in a better mood.</p><p>But don't expect much diplomatic progress anytime soon, despite signs that both sides are increasingly willing to talk. In fact, tensions may escalate again in the coming months as Tehran tries to strengthen its hand in potential negotiations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POLITICS</emphasis></p><p>President Trump continues to attract primary challengers. The latest: Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman turned talk radio host who once ranked among Trump's greatest supporters. Walsh joins Bill Weld, the former Mass. governor. Mark Sanford, the one-time governor and congressman from S.C., also says he's considering entering the GOP presidential primary.</p><p>Can they beat Trump? Unlikely. The president has a sky-high approval rating among Republicans. Early polls show him beating Weld by 70-plus percentage points.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IN THE STATES</emphasis></p><p>While most state and local governments are in decent financial shape...</p><p>Many are busy preparing for a potential recession, socking away money and keeping a lid on recurring expenditures for fear of being caught off guard.</p><p>States will continue adding to their rainy-day funds. 37 did so this year, buoyed by strong tax collections. (Tax revenues beat or met expectations in 38 states in FY 2019.) As a percentage of state spending, rainy-day funds are at record levels.</p><p>And setting aside cash for infrastructure projects...one-time expenditures that will not be a continual drain on future budgets. Plus, if a recession strikes, governments can take back the money and fund the projects with bonds instead.</p><p>A new Calif. law barring hairstyle discrimination is part of a new trend. Taking effect next year, the law protects both hairstyles and hair textures associated with a person's race, including braids, Afros and dreadlocks. It will apply to employers with five or more employees. Calif. often takes the lead with new workplace laws.</p><p>Other states are looking at the idea. N.Y. already passed a similar law, and legislation is pending in Mich. and N.J. More are expected to follow suit.</p><p>Employers may want to review and update grooming/appearance policies to address hair textures and styles. Also, train hiring managers to ensure that job applicants aren't rated unfavorably because of a race-associated hairstyle.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AG</emphasis></p><p>Democrats are angling for a larger share of the farm vote in 2020... a key constituency for President Trump. Farmers voted overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016, hoping his policies would boost the flagging rural economy.</p><p>Trade and ethanol have given the party an opening. Few farmers are happy with how Trump's trade war is playing out, despite supporting his broader goal of reducing barriers to U.S. exports. They also don't like his approach to ethanol, which critics say is undermined by the many waivers given to small oil refiners.</p><p>Both issues exacerbate other economic woes in farm country...low prices for key commodities, declining farm income, rising debt and delinquency, etc.</p><p>Most polls show Trump remains popular among farmers, though his support has eroded somewhat, depending on the survey. The latest Farm Journal Pulse poll, for example, shows 71% of farmers approving of Trump, down from 79% in July.</p><p>But even small-scale defections could help tip the balance in some key states that are critical to Trump's reelection chances next year, as they were in 2016. Think Iowa, Mich., Ohio, Pa. and Wis. Trump is polling poorly in all five states.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEMP</emphasis></p><p>Hemp still faces some hazy legal questions, despite Congress taking action last year to legalize the plant nationwide. Last winter, a long-haul trucker was charged with weed trafficking while carrying 6,700 pounds of industrial hemp through Idaho. Cannabis is illegal in the state, and hemp is considered marijuana under Idaho law. Hemp contains trace elements of THC, the psychoactive chemical found in weed, though you can't get high smoking or ingesting the plant. The outcome of the case will be a significant test of how and where hemp can be shipped in the U.S.</p><p>The Dept. of Agriculture has attempted to clear up the legal mess. In May, USDA issued a legal opinion that states cannot prohibit the interstate transportation of lawfully produced hemp. A legally binding final hemp reg is expected later this year. A handful of states bar the cultivation of hemp, a potential roadblock to the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ALCOHOL SALES</emphasis></p><p>It's getting easier to grab a beer at college football games. A growing tally of colleges and athletic conferences are allowing alcohol sales at stadiums. The powerhouse Southeastern Conference lifted its ban on alcohol, for example. The North Carolina legislature this year OK'd alcohol at state university athletic events.</p><p>Some schools are hoping beer can raise attendance, which has been down at college football games in recent years. It can also boost revenue. Another factor: Selling alcohol can curb binge drinking, since it cuts back on pregame excess.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WORLD CAPITALS</emphasis></p><p>Surprised that Indonesia is planning to move its capital city? Don't be.</p><p>Many countries have outgrown their capitals. The long list includes Brazil and Nigeria, which built Bras\u00edlia and Abuja when their capitals became too crowded.</p><p>Even the U.S. flirted with the idea earlier in its history. Washington, D.C., became the capital in 1800, replacing Philadelphia. After the Civil War, Congress considered moving the capital to the West, citing D.C.'s substandard infrastructure and overcrowded conditions, among other things. The city improved; the idea died.</p><p>Indonesia will build a new capital on Borneo to supplant overcrowded Jakarta, which also is slowly sinking into the sea. The move will cost the country $33 billion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIPLTR-ForecastsforExecutivesandInvestorsAugust2019Vol96No34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIPLTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1N-HBC1-DYTN-N3DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278342</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2323\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.

And financial markets are growing nervous. Risks to the economic expansion are rising. But we still don't think a recession is near.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. ECONOMY</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's natural to worry about the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bond yields are down...a sign that investors are concerned about the prospects for GDP growth. Yields on long-term bonds have slipped below those on short-term debt...often a sign of recession ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commodity prices are softening...again, a signal that future economic activity will be weak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Manufacturing is contracting in the U.S. and across the world as the trade war continues.</p><p>Still, there are reasons for some optimism.</p><p>Most of them hinge on the U.S. consumer. Despite talk of trade wars and manufacturing slumps and possible recession in Europe...all real problems... U.S. consumers continue to shop and spend freely. Unemployment is near a 50-year low. Wages are up. Home values and 401(k) balances are quite high.</p><p>Shoppers will have to carry the load for now because weak business investment shows no sign of perking up anytime soon.</p><p>Odds are they'll be able to. Some readings on consumer sentiment have declined lately, and a few categories of spending are starting to tail off. But for the most part, folks are spending, even on discretionary things like boats.</p><p>None of this means that all is well with the economy. Growth is slowing after coming in strong last year. There are plenty of problems overseas: Brexit. Weakness across Europe. A sharp slowdown in China. Flagging global trade.</p><p>The best-case scenario: GDP gains of 2.3% this year and 1.8% next year... far short of recession, but no boom, either. For some industries, such as farming and manufacturing, business conditions will continue to feel akin to a recession.</p><p>Growth could also slow more sharply, to 1% or even less next year...</p><p>If consumers get spooked by worrisome economic headlines. Manufacturing makes up only 11% of the overall economy, but if job losses there start to mount and cause the unemployment rate to inch up, other workers could get nervous. That in turn would ding consumer spending, which accounts for 68% of GDP.</p><p>Whether the economy slows modestly or sharply, a few things seem clear:</p><p>Interest rates will stay quite low, especially after the Federal Reserve implements additional rate cuts to stave off potential damage from the trade war.</p><p>Prices of industrial metals and other commodities will remain muted, too.</p><p>The global economy will stay shaky. And the trade situation will worsen before it gets better...both the U.S. and China are clearly digging in for a long fight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MORE ECONOMY</emphasis></p><p>Note the differing economic trajectories of regions around the country.</p><p>The Northeast and Midwest are under the greatest strain as trade tensions with China and other countries sow uncertainty and spark stock market fluctuations. The pressure is felt by financial services firms in the Northeast, with corporate profits under pressure, along with agriculture and oil firms in the Midwest. The loss of China as a market for soybeans and other crops, plus adverse weather, are slamming farmers.</p><p>Meanwhile, high-tech firms put the West and other areas on sounder footing. Calif.'s Silicon Valley and Wash.'s Puget Sound still attract ample venture capital. Fla. is gaining tech dollars, too. Other spots are benefiting from big tech's expansion: Amazon's move to Northern Virginia and Google's growth in Texas, for instance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRADE</emphasis></p><p>Tensions will climb with Europe and Japan over the specter of auto tariffs as President Trump keeps the tariff threat alive. The administration agreed in May to a six-month delay on slapping 25% tariffs on imported cars and parts from the European Union and Japan. But Trump says tariffs are \"never off the table.\"</p><p>U.S. auto tariffs would have a big effect on global trade. Autos and parts make up 8% of global trade volume. A 25% duty would hike new-car prices by $2,750, on average, and lead to spikes in used-car prices. Germany would take the biggest hit in the EU, as it makes up 55% of EU auto exports and is on the verge of a recession.</p><p>Autos are just a piece of a larger discussion about a trade deal with the EU. Trump's tactics are also aimed at reducing EU duties on industrial and farm imports.</p><p>It's unlikely that the trade war will morph into a damaging currency war.</p><p>But the danger will remain front and center as Trump refuses to rule out the possibility of using measures to counter the greenback's strength. The decision in early Aug. to label Beijing a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994 has heightened market worries about trade battles spilling over into global currencies.</p><p>Deliberate devaluations are rare and not easy to achieve. One big reason: Currency markets are so huge, with roughly $5 trillion per day changing hands and about $4 trillion of those trades involving the dollar. Even if the Treasury Dept. took sweeping action to weaken the dollar, it would need help from other nations.</p><p>Past currency interventions were coordinated efforts. The most famous: The U.S.-engineered Plaza Accord of 1985 with France, Germany, Britain and Japan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCE</emphasis></p><p>The Federal Reserve is creating a real-time payments system. Called FedNow, the system will narrow the amount of time between when money is deposited or transferred into an account and when it is available for use. At the present time, banks issue IOUs to each other to make funds immediately available to customers. Many of the transactions, from direct deposits to bill payments, are settled in batches three times per day during business hours. FedNow will launch in four to five years.</p><p>The Fed's system will compete with another one owned by the large banks, started in 2017 and run by the Clearing House. Big banks aren't fond of the Fed move, but the Fed says having two competitors will bring down prices and spur innovation.</p><p>The U.S. is playing catch-up with other countries, such as Brazil, Turkey, Japan and Singapore, that can handle real-time payments. Consumers nowadays expect instant money transfers as they shop online or send money via mobile app.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REAL ESTATE</emphasis></p><p>Uncle Sam is taking action to spur condo purchases by first-time buyers. The Federal Housing Admin. is tweaking the rules for the types of mortgages that it will insure at condominium developments. After the housing crash, regulations were tightened, and FHA-backed mortgages for condos sank from 72,900 in 2010 to 16,200 in 2018. Today, just 6.5% of the 150,000 condo developments in the U.S. are eligible for FHA-backed mortgages. The new rules, which will increase that tally with looser requirements that cover many more condos, will take effect in Oct.</p><p>Expect the move to boost the entry-level condo market in many areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">POLITICS</emphasis></p><p>An upcoming special election in N.C. is effectively a harbinger of 2020.</p><p>Both parties are desperate to win the state's ninth congressional district, which remains up for grabs after election fraud invalidated the 2018 result.</p><p>The district backed President Trump in 2016 by more than 11 points and demographically favors the GOP, with its sizable share of white rural voters.</p><p>But polls suggest a tight race on Sept. 10, and the Democrat, Dan McCready, has raised three times as much money as his Republican opponent, Dan Bishop.</p><p>Conservative groups are pouring money into the race to put Bishop over the top. The state senator has closely tied himself to Trump, so a loss in this conservative-leaning district would prompt panic throughout the party. But a Bishop win might encourage more Republicans to ally with Trump in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELECTRONS</emphasis></p><p>States will do more to guard against foreign meddling in U.S. elections in the absence of help from Congress. Federal election-security legislation remains bogged down by partisan bickering and is unlikely to pass anytime soon.</p><p>Some examples: Del. unveiled new voting machines this year. S.C. will have a new, paper-based voting system next year. And Ga. is contracting with a Denver-based company for a combined touch screen/paper ballot system.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REGS</emphasis></p><p>A new Trump administration rule puts tighter limits on legal immigration.</p><p>The target: Immigrants who use or are likely to use public benefits, such as food stamps and Medicaid. Set to take effect Oct. 15, the rule would make it more difficult for such individuals to obtain a green card or extend a temporary visa.</p><p>The goal: Shift the U.S. to a more skills-based immigration system by favoring wealthier, educated immigrants who can support themselves. The change will affect immigration from Latin America the most, Europe and Canada the least.</p><p>Businesses already short of workers will feel the effect...farms, hotels, restaurants, home health care providers. All rely on low-income, legal immigrant labor.</p><p>Legal challenges will be swift and numerous. Calif. and three other states filed the latest lawsuit, joining other states, counties and nonprofit groups.</p><p>Industry groups are lauding a proposal to ease driving rules for truckers... revised every eight to nine years...from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Admin.</p><p>What's new? Drivers could hit pause on their 14-hours-of-service clock to take an off-duty break of at least 30 minutes, but not more than three hours, so long as they take 10 consecutive hours off duty at the end of their shift.</p><p>Plus more flexibility for rest breaks and off-duty time. For example, drivers could split their required 10 hours off duty into two periods, one with seven hours, at least, spent in the sleeper berth; the other must be at least two consecutive hours.</p><p>Drivers could also extend their workday if affected by adverse conditions, such as bad weather and traffic congestion, by up to two additional hours.</p><p>For short-haul truckers: Expanded on-duty time and geographical range. These are truckers who make local deliveries, mostly within an urban area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LABOR</emphasis></p><p>Proposed changes would make it easier for workers to boot out unions, the first of many expected tweaks to Obama-era union election rules by the National Labor Relations Board, now controlled by a Republican majority.</p><p>A decertifying election can be held, despite charges of unfair labor practices. Currently, such charges can delay an election by months, even years. The proposal would allow the vote to proceed, but a ballot count must wait till the charge is resolved.</p><p>Employees will have a 45-day window to request a vote to decertify a union once an employer has voluntarily recognized it. Under current union election rules, a dissenting employee can't request a vote for at least six months, sometimes longer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AG</emphasis></p><p>Be skeptical of the Dept. of Agriculture's latest corn and soybean forecasts. Many analysts say they're at odds with what's happening on the ground... the yield estimates in particular. USDA's predictions of 169.5 bushels per acre for corn and 48.5 for soybeans are optimistic, they say, especially in a year rife with bad weather and late planting. For example, around 40% of this year's corn crop was planted in June. Yields decline significantly on corn planted after May 20.</p><p>Private estimates paint a less sunny picture. A recent tour of key farm states by Gro Intelligence found corn yields six bushels per acre and soybean yields four bushels per acre below USDA estimates. Yields in the eastern Corn Belt...Ill., Ind., Ohio...were off as much as 24 bushels per acre for corn, nine bushels for soybeans.</p><p>Marijuana legalization has been a tax windfall for participating states.</p><p>But even with some form of legality in 34 states, the black market thrives. Because of heavy taxation and regulation, many growers have decided not to go legit. One study valued the illegal trade at $70 billion...seven times the legal market's size.</p><p>Why hasn't the black market shut down? Illegal weed generally costs less.</p><p>Many cities in Calif., the largest fully legal market, won't allow dispensaries, turning customers to the black market. And the counterculture that developed around marijuana's illegality is so entrenched, many members don't trust the changes.</p><p>Look for states to tweak their tax structures to be more price-competitive. They'll also stress quality control. And crack down on those who won't come around.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE WORLD</emphasis></p><p>The longest war in American history is at least one step closer to ending.</p><p>The U.S. is on the verge of a deal to withdraw troops from Afghanistan following months of talks with Taliban leaders. The plan: The U.S. will start removing its roughly 14,000 troops from the country if the Taliban refuse terrorists safe harbor.</p><p>One thing is clear: President Trump wants out before the 2020 elections, allowing him to fulfill a key campaign promise. The U.S. would withdraw 5,000 troops as part of the deal with the Taliban, which the White House wants done by Sept. 1</p><p>But plenty of questions remain. Will the U.S. push for a broader peace deal between the Taliban and Afghan government? Unclear. The Trump administration has sent mixed messages. Also unclear: Will Trump back down? Fellow Republicans, who fear a worsening terrorist threat from ISIS and others, are pushing back hard.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AIRLINES</emphasis></p><p>Don't expect to see Boeing's 737 Max jet in the air again until at least Jan. The plane has been grounded since mid-March. Even after the software is fixed and OK'd by the Federal Aviation Admin., it will take airlines at least a month to train pilots and reactivate the nearly 400 Max jet planes gathering dust at airports.</p><p>The delay throws a wrench into carriers' scheduling for the holiday season. Pulling the jet from schedules will cause flight cancellations and travel disruptions. It could also push up prices and force travelers to book less convenient routes. The grounding is costly for U.S. carriers, which are leasing planes from other airlines to make up capacity. They're also using older, less fuel-efficient planes, upping costs and cutting profits. Things will get worse as delivery dates for new Max jets slip. Southwest and American are feeling it most. Delta doesn't have any Maxes in its fleet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIPLTR-ForecastsforExecutivesandInvestorsAugust2019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIPLTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT0-RNP1-JCBK-Y39D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278342</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2319\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.

It grabs over 40% of spending and is growing rapidly, poised to overtake traditional media...TV, print, etc.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How can businesses spend ad dollars wisely</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are some key trends and timely tips.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SELLING</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Googleand Facebook dominate digital, accounting for 58% of online ad spending. Google's share is 37%. Facebook...21%. Amazon is in a distant third place, with 4% of all ad dollars, but it's making a major push and has room to run.</p><p>On social media, flashy visuals rule the day. Video ads are proliferating and are about to be 25% of all digital ad spending. Facebook-owned Instagram, a photo-sharing app, is seeing torrid video ad growth.</p><p>Digital upgrades are helping TV and radio, making it easier to tally audiences and improve ads. Traditional TV viewers will dip slightly in years ahead, but TV delivered over the web is growing swiftly. Radio has received a boost from web-connected speakers.</p><p>Print will continue its decline in ad spending. Trade publications will tend to hold steady, though.</p><p>Billboards, digital displays and other out-of-home advertising are growing in terms of dollars spent. Tech giants such as Apple and Netflix have spent heavily.</p><p>Other areas gaining traction: Video games, movie theaters and podcasts.</p><p>Some advice for sellers trying to navigate the fast-changing ad landscape:</p><p>Go where your customers are. For niche audiences: Social media, search or display ads on Google and Amazon, infomercials on your website or event hosting are good choices. Targeting other businesses? Skip other social apps and try LinkedIn.</p><p>Focus on improving mobile sites as more web surfers rely on smartphones. Sites have to load fast and the buying process has to be simple, as finicky customers will ditch a slow mobile site in a heartbeat. Keep video ads short and text minimal.</p><p>Save money with do-it-yourself advertising by cutting out the middleman. Both Google and Amazonare focused on making it easier to place your own online ads.</p><p>Try Amazon if you haven't before. Its conversion rate...the portion of people who click or buy...is far higher than Google's. Folks on Amazon are in a buying mood.</p><p>Keep an eye on ad tech upgrades to television, radio and other \"old\" media. We expect coming changes to make it much easier to target the customers you want.</p><p>Amazon's potential growth seems greater than that of Facebook or Google. Amazon will nearly double its online ad share by 2020, stealing from the two leaders. While Facebook and Googlerely on ads for nearly all their revenue, Amazon doesn't.</p><p>Note that governments are likely to be a headwind because new tech taxes are being proposed. The U.K., for instance, is planning a new levy on big tech firms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. ECONOMY</emphasis></p><p>Job growth bounced back in Oct. from a hurricane-depressed level in Sept. 250,000 jobs were added as many folks jumped back into the labor force, driving up the participation rate. All major sectors contributed to the strong report.</p><p>There's nothing that stands in the way of a Dec. interest rate hike by the Fed.</p><p>Expect monthly job gains to slow to below 200,000 in 2019. Wage gains will continue to rise, to about 3.5% next year, as the unemployment rate falls further.</p><p>Though factories are still humming, more manufacturers are feeling jittery about rising trade risks and soaring production costs. Ford notes that the 25% tariff on steel and 10% duty on aluminum will slash profits by about $1 billion, for example.</p><p>Business spending will be healthy for the full year...about a 7% pickup, compared with 2017's 5.3% rise. But note the steep drop-off in the third quarter... a 0.8% annual rate, the worst since 2016...versus the second quarter's 8.7% rise.</p><p>For 2019, a leveling off or slight decline in business spending is in the cards as fears mount over trade wars, slowing global growth and rising raw material costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GLOBAL ECONOMY</emphasis></p><p>China's economic momentum is fading as it battles several risky headwinds.</p><p>Third-quarter GDP growth slowed to a year-over-year rate of 6.5%, from 6.7% in the second quarter. Expect a 6.6% expansion for 2018, down from 6.9% last year.</p><p>GDP growth will ratchet down significantly in 2019...to 6.3%. Trade battles with the U.S. aren't the only problem. Beijing suffers from slowing domestic demand, a continuing outflow of foreign investment and tightening U.S. monetary policy.</p><p>Longer-term challenges could hinder China's rise, too. Its aging population will require more social spending, shrinking the funds available to invest domestically. Plus, key trading partners are trying to contest China's push into high-tech sectors.</p><p>The European Union and Italy are nearing a showdown on budget discipline. Italy's populist leaders want a hefty fiscal stimulus to stoke growth. But the spending would push its deficit up to 2.4% of GDP, which EU authorities refuse to accept. The EU has given Rome until mid-Nov. to develop another plan. Italy may back down, but it will still buck EU proposals and widen its budget deficit from last year's 1.8%.</p><p>The EU's fourth-largest economy faces anemic growth ahead. For 2018 and 2019, expect paltry economic expansion of just 1%, after growth of 1.6% in 2017.</p><p>The big worry is a lack of confidence in Italy's ability to repay its debts, which could spark big trouble for the EU. Italy's borrowing costs are already sky-high.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FINANCE</emphasis></p><p>Banks will see dwindling returns from rising interest rates in coming months. In the past few years, banks have been boosting their profits as the difference between the rate they charged on loans and their borrowing costs steadily widened. Banks were quick to raise loan rates, but slower to move on what they paid on deposits.</p><p>Customers are hungry for yield on cash that has been sitting in accounts that pay no interest. Banks are now seeing an outflow of money from such accounts.</p><p>Several credit unions and online banks offer rates as high as 2%, far higher than the average yearly 0.09% rate on savings accounts. Some big banks pay even less.</p><p>Small-business lending is growing at a steady clip, with total commercial and industrial loans extended by U.S. banks up in Oct. about 6% from a year ago.</p><p>Small banks are leading the charge, with a beefier 12% increase in lending. They hold about half of small-business loans, even though they have only 17% of banking assets. Small firms rely on nearby small banks because very few of them accept small-business loan applications online. That gives the banks a natural edge.</p><p>Note that interest rates on small-business loans are rising. Premiums charged on riskier loans are heading higher, too, as are the costs for lines of credit.</p><p>Fintech companies in the payment industry are becoming bigger players. For example, PayPal and Square now use customer data to underwrite loans for smalls.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CONGRESS</emphasis></p><p>Earmarks are poised for a comeback. Lawmakers think they can be trusted to again steer money to specific projects without lining their own pockets or those of donors, relatives, etc., which led Congress to ban the practice in 2011.</p><p>Top Democrats say they will reinstate the practice, which is almost as old as the country itself, if they control the House next year, but with restrictions: No funds for businesses. No anonymous, unclaimed requests. No midnight add-ins.</p><p>Democrats note that unprecedented legislative gridlock came with the ban: There is less incentive to compromise or take a tough vote without any sweetener, such as money to build a highway, repair a bridge or launch a program back home.</p><p>Many Republicans agree, especially top brass, President Trump included. But many conservative and watchdog groups call earmarks government waste. Whether earmarks return depends on enough House members voting to do so and keeping Trump on their side, or getting their Senate colleagues on board, too. Any two sides can push the holdout their way. If the House allows earmarks, and Trump will sign bills with them, why would the Senate deny itself the privilege? Conversely, if pork-laden bills can't pass the Senate or will be vetoed by Trump, why would House Democrats take the PR hit? Trump could be the swing vote.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ELECTIONS</emphasis></p><p>President Trump is trying to make immigration the midterms' defining issue. He hopes to energize his voters as in 2016 and boost Republican turnout. The issue will help them win the Senate but put the House further out of GOP reach.</p><p>Being anti-immigrant doesn't play well with swing suburban women voters, exactly whom Republicans need to retain House control. It also motivates Latino voters in states where Democrats are targeting Republican senators: Ariz., Nev. and Texas. Trump thinks it's a risk worth taking. Many women will not vote for him regardless. But the issue can help Republicans win Senate seats in Ind., Mo., N.D. and W.Va.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOREIGN POLICY</emphasis></p><p>North Korea is hoping for a kinder, gentler Trump after the midterms. Pyongyang says it will curtail its nuclear program if the U.S. eases sanctions. North Korea hoped its leader's chemistry with Trump would eventually win it relief. But Trump has mostly pushed harder since his historic meeting with Kim Jong Un, despite ally South Korea's desire to reestablish economic ties with the rogue regime. Chinese and Russian circumvention of international sanctions can do only so much. Kim wants a modern economy for his destitute nation, which requires U.S. relief.</p><p>Another major arms control agreement with Russia will soon bite the dust. Inked in 2010, New START limits the tally of strategic warheads that can be deployed by Washington and Moscow. The Trump administration will likely let it expire in 2021. Trump is also pulling the U.S. out of a 1987 treaty because Russia hasn't honored it. The Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces pact is credited with easing Cold War tensions.</p><p>The worst-case scenario: A new arms race with both Russia and China.</p><p>The American-Chinese rivalry isn't heating up just on the trade front. Confrontation and fostering competition with Beijing is Trump's default position, which is creating new diplomatic and military standoffs, most evidently over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Trump is moving Washington closer to Taipei militarily, infuriating China, which considers the island a breakaway province, not a country. Past presidents walked a fine line, embracing Taipei without antagonizing Beijing.</p><p>Trump continues freedom-of-navigation exercises in the South China Sea to counter Beijing's dominance in the area, increasing the risk of direct conflict: Consider the near collision between American and Chinese warships operating there.</p><p>Expect more close calls as China tries to beat the U.S. in naval superiority.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HEALTH CARE</emphasis></p><p>Another Obamacare tweak is in the offing, this one dealing with HRAs... health reimbursement accounts. Small businesses will benefit most, initially. Employers, starting with insurance plans kicking in after Jan. 1, 2020, can use HRAs to help workers buy insurance under the proposed Labor Dept. rule. Today's HRAs can be tapped only for actual medical expenses, not premiums.</p><p>The change should lead to more options for people employed by smalls. Many have just one plan choice or go outside their workplace for health insurance. Companies offering defined plans would also be allowed to give workers $1,800 extra to cover out-of-pocket expenses and premiums for \"excepted\" benefits, such as dental.</p><p>The Trump administration is tinkering at the Affordable Care Act's margins to give states more latitude in following the law as Congress deadlocks over changes. Waivers to deviate from the Affordable Care Act's standards will be easier to get. States won't have to prove as much to get an \"innovation\" waiver, paving the way for more Americans to buy plans that don't meet the law's coverage requirements. Such plans are cheaper and often chosen by healthy Americans, leaving sicker ones in plans with ever-increasing premiums and costs...de facto high-risk pools.</p><p>Expect lawsuits after the first waiver under the relaxed rules is granted.</p><p>As more insurers direct patients to specific doctors, hospitals and labs...</p><p>More people are receiving unwelcome \"surprise\" bills for services rendered by providers outside their insurance network, usually for an urgent condition. Some budget-busting examples: $109,000 for heart attack-related treatment; $17,850 for a urine test. Emergency patients often don't have the luxury of checking whether a service provider or doctor at an ER is in network before getting treated.</p><p>State lawmakers have noticed, and angry voters are pushing Congress for a federal fix. Calif. and N.Y. protect their residents the most from such bills. Twenty-one states offer some relief for patients socked with these unexpected charges. But self-funded plans, which cover 60% of workers, are regulated by federal law, putting pressure on Congress to come up with a national fix. Look for one next year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AG</emphasis></p><p>U.S. soybean growers can add Brazil's new president to their list of worries. Brazilian farmers were already their top competition. Now Jair Bolsonaro, their president-elect, has promised to roll back environmental restrictions on farming. If he can deliver on his promise to open more Amazon rain forest land to cultivation, Brazil could leap even further ahead of the U.S. as the world's top soybean exporter.</p><p>American farmers are already being squeezed by the trade war with China. Beijing is the world's largest soy importer, but it turned to Brazil even before tariffs were levied by the U.S. on Chinese goods, causing China to retaliate on ag goods.</p><p>Most U.S. farmers can expect mild temperatures from Dec. through Feb., says the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin. Arctic Alaska, tropical Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Plains have the best odds of warm weather. No region faces a colder-than-usual winter, the government's forecasters predict. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Farmer's Almanac</emphasis> disagrees. The folksy guide predicts a \"teeth-chattering\" winter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KIPTAX-ForecastsforExecutivesandInvestors2November2018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KIPLTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKG-4841-JCBK-Y3TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278342</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2316\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc.

Every morning, he would setup his modest sidewalk stand, which was nothing more than a few milk crates with a piece of wood and cloth on top, and gradually bend long strands of wire into the shape of small bicycles - the kind of model that you would put on your desk or dresser.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Each bicycle model took him about an hour to make, which Mr. Wang then sold for about $4 each. On an average day, he sold about 10 of the wire bicycles, netting him, about $8,000 a year. Not a bad salary in a country where the average yearly income in 2015 was $7,925. After walking by his stand numerous times, I finally bought one of the models. A month later, Mr. Wang wasn't at his usual spot and I did not see him again over the next month.</p><p>Shortly after, we moved to a new office in a different area of Shanghai, a few miles from where Mr. Wang's street-side shop was situated. One day, I had a meeting near our old office, and much to my surprise, he was there.</p><p>It turned out that Mr. Wang had gone digital. In his absence from his road-side stand, a friend had helped him start selling his small model bikes on Taobao &amp; Tmall, China's largest C2C and B2C e-commerce platforms, where $449 billion in merchandise changed hands in 2016. Selling both online and offline had dramatically increased his sales and now he was selling 30-40 a day and had some of his friends helping to shape the bicycles.</p><p>Beyond stopping to say 'hi,' I also wanted to buy one of the small wire bikes for a friend, but when I went to hand the money to him, he waved me off and pointed to two large printed QR ('quick response') codes, and asked me to pay using Alipay or WeChat Pay, China's two leading mobile payment providers. I unlocked my mobile phone, scanned the Alipay code and a few seconds later, I had paid and was on my way.</p><p>In many ways, Mr. Wang's shift to digital is emblematic of the country as a whole. Every day across China, hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses use digital payments and digital finance for social and commercial uses. At a micro level, digital finance allows individuals like Mr. Wang to improve their own or their family's lives. At a macro level, digital payments have the potential to dramatically improve living standards for large sections of the population, especially in developing areas of the country, through increased transparency, security, and lower cost.</p><p>'Internet finance,' as 'fintech' is commonly known in China, has enabled financial inclusion and economic empowerment in a way that had previously not been possible in China, largely because of its geographic, cultural, and economic diversity. China's internet finance boom started with digital payments, but has since expanded to include wealth management, credit, and lending. Digital finance has brought many people like Mr. Wang, into the financial fold.</p><p>While this has been good for the financial industry and the economy as a whole, risks remain. In 2016, more than 1,700 of China's P2P (peer-to-peer) lending platforms closed, leading to huge losses for investors and borrowers. Many claim that China's $9 trillion in wealth-management products, which are now largely sold through digital platforms, are also a ticking time bomb. Traditional players also struggle to compete in the new digital finance landscape.</p><p>This innovation and stability paradox that fintech poses is a challenge for governments globally, but even more so in China where the financial industry is still relatively underdeveloped, yet remains a critical part of the nation's economic growth in terms of infrastructure and lending. Even as China's government and regulators continue \"to cross the river by feeling the stones,\" and allow growth of new platforms and services like digital payments and P2P lending, they are also very cautious about creating any potential risks to continued economic growth.</p><p>Arguably, many of China's 2001 WTO agreement commitments were approached with the same intent. Industry reform was often delayed to protect the stability and growth of the domestic market. If the market had immediately opened to foreign banks in 2001 as per the WTO commitment, the sector would have likely collapsed along with the economy itself. Some WTO commitments still remain outstanding such as allowing foreign payment schemes like Visa and MasterCard to operate domestic RMB businesses.</p><p>Therefore, trying to influence the Chinese regulators to make changes on a schedule that does not match their own, is a fool's errand. Regardless of the comments, threats or negotiating tactics of foreign governments, China's regulators will reform at their own pace.</p><p>That is not to say that that the U.S. should give up trying to influence China to further open its financial industry. I will argue the opposite, the U.S. government will be more successful through deeper engagement including setting up financial industry focused working groups with industry players from both sides, and a refocus on the financial products of the future like mobile payments rather than those of the past, like payment cards. In addition, the government should be paying greater attention to the expansion of China's tech giants internationally, which poses, among others, a specific challenge to America's national security.</p><p>Finally, although the discussion is centered on the openness of China's financial industry, that is not where all of the answers lie. The U.S.'s internal regulations also limit the U.S.'s industry growth and development, while at the same time providing foreign companies relatively unfettered access the U.S. domestic fintech market.</p><p>\"China is playing a $9 trillion game of chicken with savers,\" April 11th, 2017, Bloomberg China Finance Disrupted - Page 3 Setting the context - China's shift from cash to digital</p><p>China's history of physical currency is a long one. The country's first use of cash can be traced back to as early as 770 BC where \"coins\" in the shape of cowrie shells were used to settle trade. These were replaced around 350 BC by actual metal coins that had either a round or square hole in the middle to allow them to be strung and carried. But carrying around strings of coins could be quite heavy for merchants, so eventually, by the 7th century AD, China pioneered the first use of paper money.</p><p>Until recently, China remained a heavily cash-based society. In 2010, nearly 61% of China's retail consumption was still transacted in cash, even as debit card penetration reached about 1.8 cards per person. A number of factors account for this reliance on cash, including high levels of perceived trust and convenience for cash, and habit. However, the payment landscape is changing rapidly as cards and digital payments have grown in importance, with the proportion of retail consumption transacted in cash falling to 40% in 2015. Compare this to the UK where in 2016, cash accounted for 45% of all transactions. During that same 2010-2015 period, mobile and internet payments grew from 3% of retail consumption to 17% in China.</p><p>Traditional Financial Services</p><p>Since the 1970s, China's financial sector has played a major role in the country's economic development. China's \"Big Four\" banks are predominantly government-owned and serve as an essential tool for the government to allocate resources to public and private sector projects. Initially, because there were only four large banks and interest rates were government- controlled rather than market driven, industry competition was limited.</p><p>However, shortly after China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, new segments of domestic banks started to appear, including \"city commercial\" banks like the Bank of Shanghai, and \"joint-stock commercial banks\" (also known as \"shareholding banks\"), as well as foreign entrants, such as HSBC and Citi. The increased competition pushed Chinese banks to adapt their business models, products, and service offerings, yet improvements to the overall customer experience were modest. The competitive size advantages enjoyed by these traditional players created an environment in which innovation and differentiation were not a high priority. Even if the new \"traditional\" competition pushed the industry forward a small step, it was by no means a giant leap.</p><p>Despite a lack of competition and product diversity in China's financial industry, the underlying technology is quite robust. Most of China's big banks employ modern core-banking software and many are embracing cloud computing to reduce costs and increase agility. In addition, China has a domestic real-time payments system for both retail and commercial payments and, in 2015, launched the China Interbank Payments System (commonly referred to as CIPS) which supports the development of the renminbi (RMB) as an international trade currency.</p><p>China's retail, non-cash payments market is also quite well developed. China UnionPay is the country's main domestic payment card clearing and settlement system, enabling the use of UnionPay- branded credit or debit cards at the estimated 26.7 million merchants that have electronic point- of-sale devices installed to accept card payments.8 Debit card penetration stands at 3.1 cards per person and is increasing. In addition, every new point- of-sale device sold in China must come equipped with Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology to enable mobile payments.</p><p>Similarly, China's internet and mobile infrastructure is very robust.</p><p>Internet and Mobile Phone penetration</p><p>As of January 2016, China had 688 million internet users, which is more than twice the size of the entire population of the United States. Even with such a large pool of users, China's internet penetration rate is just over 50% of the population. This compares with the US rate of 84%. There is massive potential for future growth.</p><p>Relatively cheap, full-function smartphones are also widely available in China through many Chinese manufacturers. The result is a significant difference in average selling prices, which are at least $50 less in China than globally. Lower prices have spurred the adoption of smartphones in China, where penetration is about 20% higher than the global average.</p><p>Mobile data in China is also cheaper than other countries. For instance, a pay-as-you-go 2 gigabyte data package from China Mobile is 120 RMB (US$17.40). A similar data package from T- Mobile in the US would cost US$20.50. These smartphones are able to use a 4G telecommunications network that covers 76% of the population, which is comparable to the US where 4G coverage is 81%.</p><p>Finally, China's millennials are particularly active users of mobile phones. For many of them, their smartphone is their first, and often only, avenue for accessing the internet. Smartphones are cheap and provide easy access. In 2015, only about 49.6% of China's households had a personal computer,14 this contrasts with the United States where household computer ownership stands at 87.3%.15 This characteristic is another one that China may have in common with other geographies where mobile penetration is high and computer penetration is low.</p><p>With relatively little competition in the traditional financial industry, and very good technology infrastructure, the sector was ripe for disruption. Digital finance just lacked one thing: trust.</p><p>Digital Payment Development</p><p>Alipay</p><p>Alibaba Group's first e-commerce platform, Alibaba.com, was launched in 1998 in Hangzhou, China. The site was originally designed as a business-to- business (B2B) platform to match foreign buyers with Chinese sellers. In 2003, the company launched Taobao, a consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platform, which proved highly successful.</p><p>Taobao is a multi-merchant e-commerce platform where individuals or small merchants can set up a storefront and sell products. Alibaba does not actually sell products directly, but provides the marketplace infrastructure for the merchants on the platform, including the technology, payments, and logistics, like an eBay in the U.S. or Amazon Marketplace.</p><p>Five years later, in 2008, Alibaba launched Taobao Mall (now known as Tmall), a business-to-consumer (B2C) platform that achieved similar growth and popularity. The two platforms quickly became China's largest e-commerce sites.</p><p>Most of the transactions in the early days of Taobao and Tmall were cash on delivery, where the customer would pay the courier when the product was delivered. This approach worked, but it was not the most efficient. Many internet payment services were available, but they were primarily used for paying bills or charging phones. None were not designed with e-commerce in mind. A consumer could make a payment online, but there was no recourse if the transaction was fraudulent; the money would have been transferred instantly, with no built-in chargeback mechanism typically found in a credit card or PayPal-like transaction today.</p><p>As a result, Alibaba decided to create its own payments mechanism, Alipay, in 2004. Using Alipay, users can hold money in a digital wallet that can be topped up using debit cards, physical prepaid cards, or by receiving money from others in a P2P or B2C transaction.</p><p>Alibaba then introduced Alipay into Taobao, its already well- established, e-commerce platform. Shoppers on Taobao were given the option of setting up and using Alipay instead of cash during the checkout process, although \"cash on delivery\" remained an option. To address the challenge of building trust among users and potential users, Alipay was designed as an escrow system so that the merchant would not be paid until the customer was satisfied with the purchase.</p><p>In doing this, Alibaba addressed the key payment challenges of trust and scale, giving consumers more confidence to make transactions with vendors that may have been thousands of miles away. The payments service rapidly gained in popularity thanks to its use on Taobao, and in 2015, Alipay accounted for nearly 50% of all internet payments in China.</p><p>The initial Alipay service launched in 2004 was internet-based. The company introduced a mobile version in 2009. By 2016, Alipay was processing 175 million transactions per day, 60% of which were completed through a mobile phone.</p><p>Still, its market share in internet payments has since been eroded slightly by a similar product from rival Tencent Holdings.</p><p>Tencent: WeChat Pay</p><p>China's other popular mobile payments service was established by Tencent, founded in the Southern Chinese city of Shenzhen in 1998. Tencent has two major social apps, QQ and Weixin, or WeChat as it is known in English, which had a combined monthly active user rate of 846 million as of Q3 2016.</p><p>WeChat is similar in some respects to Facebook and WhatsApp, two popular social networks launched several years before WeChat. WeChat allows users to chat with contacts one-on-one via messaging, audio, or video, facilitates communication among large groups, and has a functionality called \"Moments\" that is like Facebook's \"Timeline.\" Moments allows subscribers to post images, thoughts, popular news articles, and other material that can be viewed by selected members of the user's contact list. Most of its users spend a considerable amount of time in the app, logging into it multiple times per day to keep up with their friends and to post and review messages, thoughts, and pictures.</p><p>In 2005, Tencent had developed a digital payment platform called Tenpay, which was launched nine months after the initial internet version of Alipay was released. Tenpay allowed users to pay for Tencent's products and services, such as its online gaming and music offerings, and was also interoperable with many e-commerce platforms (except for Taobao or Tmall, the two Alibaba e-commerce properties).</p><p>In 2013, Tencent integrated the Tenpay payment app into WeChat. This function, known as \"WeChat Pay\", allowed users to setup a digital wallet contained within the WeChat app and access a variety of products and services on WeChat. Linking the wallet to a debit card or credit card enabled the user to transfer value over to the WeChat Pay wallet and store it there for later use.</p><p>It was less obvious then, but in no time, digital payments pushed Tencent and Alibaba into the financial industry. Such payments created the basis for a much larger business opportunity: for the two companies to leverage data collected to offer additional products and services to consumers and small businesses, and create one-stop financial service ecosystems.</p><p>Wealth Management</p><p>As Alipay grew, the company realized that customers were leaving money in their Alipay wallets. In 2013, liquidity was tight in the banking market, so interbank deposits were in high demand. To capitalize on this, Alibaba worked with Tianhong Asset Management and launched the Yu'e bao (meaning \"leftover treasure\") product, a low-risk money market account like a bank savings account.</p><p>The idea was simple: Customers could take the money \"sitting\" in their digital wallets and invest it on the Yu'e bao product. Consumers could invest in the Yu'e bao product, which at the time paid a high interest of between 6-7% annually as it was based on interbank lending, and have the freedom to withdraw their funds at any time. This was a significant change from the rules of typical time-bound deposit products offered by banks, where there are early withdrawal penalties. Although it seemed as if Alipay was acting as a fund manager in providing this product, from a regulatory perspective Alipay was a distribution service, while Tianhong was treated as the fund manager, making it easier for Alipay to offer Yu'e bao.</p><p>Yu'e bao was a hit, with customers valuing the ease with which they could shop online, pay bills, and now, easily and flexibly invest their savings. Yu'e bao grew from 0.2 billion RMB (US$29 million) in assets under management (AUM) in the second quarter of 2013 to more than 810 billion RMB (US$117 billion) with more than 152 million customers three years later. Consumers are also allowed to use funds on Yu'e bao to complete e-commerce transactions directly. On November 11th, 2016, known as \"Singles' Day\" and also the biggest online shopping day of the year, 11% of all Alipay transactions were made using Yu'e bao.17 All of this has made Tianhong Asset Management one of the largest money market funds in the world.</p><p>In January 2014, about seven months after Yu'e bao was launched, Tencent launched a nearly identical product called Licaitong. Within one year, the Licaitong product had over 10 million users and AUM had reached RMB 100 billion (US$14.5 billion).</p><p>Prior to these two offerings, wealth management products (WMPs) in China were only available to those with significant assets. For instance, most WMP required a minimum investment of RMB 10,000 (US$1,450), which was out of reach for many of China's consumers. Yu'e bao and Licaitong, however, needed only a minimum investment of one RMB. This helped to \"democratize\" wealth management, making it more inclusive and accessible to more sections of the population. Indeed, China's banks have followed suit and now have a range of WMPs that can be purchased for as little as one RMB. Digital Credit Rating</p><p>One of the challenges China's financial industry has faced is a lack of accurate and complete credit information. According to World Bank estimates, although 79% of China's adults have had a bank account at some point, only 10% of these have ever borrowed in the formal financial system, which means that there is little information available on potential borrowers' credit histories. In addition, China only established a nationwide commercial credit database in 2005 and a consumer credit database in 2006. As a result, as of 2015, the PBOC had data on 880 million people, about two-thirds of the total population, but only maintained credit histories on 380 million people, less than one-third of the adult population. In comparison, 89% of Americans have a credit score.</p><p>This situation has made it difficult for lenders to accurately assess credit risk and make lending decisions for either retail or commercial lending, a problem further exacerbated by the fact that China's government has so far been reluctant to allow international credit reporting companies to set up their businesses in China.</p><p>In January 2015, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) selected eight technology companies to set up consumer credit scoring businesses including the Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial. Shortly after that, Ant Financial launched its Sesame Credit product, which now has 190 million users.</p><p>Sesame Credit assesses user creditworthiness through five metrics: the credit history of the user, financial behavior, contractual capacity, identity, and their social network. The service also looks at consistency and preferences in their history for shopping, money transfer, and wealth management. They can tap into over 350 million real-name registered users and 37 million small businesses that buy and sell on Alibaba Group marketplaces, including Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com and reportedly use over 100 million data sources.</p><p>When users sign up for Sesame Credit they agree to terms and conditions that allow Ant Financial to use their transaction data to assess their credit worthiness and use it to come up with a credit score. This score is also shared with Ant Financial's partners. For instance, a program was set up in June 2015 with the Luxembourg Government to allow Sesame Credit scores to be used in place of bank records in securing a visa for the Schengen travel area in Europe. Also, third-party non-bank financial companies like China's many peer-to-peer (P2P) lending companies are not allowed to access the PBOC's credit databases, so many have chosen to integrate Sesame Credit into their credit rating systems. At the Hangzhou train station, if your credit score is above 600, you can even borrow an umbrella.</p><p>Sesame Credit can also play a constructive role in terms of financial inclusion in China. One of the biggest challenges for financial institutions is lending in second- or third-tier cities. Firms like Sesame Credit that provide reliable credit scoring services, could potentially help lenders to provide financing to people who otherwise may be deemed ineligible.</p><p>In July 2016, Sesame Credit launched a similar credit checking and rating system for SMEs called \"Ling'Zhi\" - which means \"Smart Sesame\" in Chinese. The system is designed to better assess the credit of SMEs and could potentially open new funding channels for a segment of the market that has been, until recently, starved of bank credit.</p><p>Lending</p><p>Before launching Sesame Credit, Alibaba had been providing micro- credit to merchants on the Taobao and Tmall platforms since 2010. Because Taobao and Tmall work on the escrow model, being able to borrow small amounts to cover short-term financing needs is useful for a merchant who would otherwise potentially need to wait up to two weeks to receive payment for a product they have already shipped.</p><p>In addition to lending to companies, In December 2014, Ant Financial started lending to individual consumers through a service called Huabei or \"Just Spend.\" Tied into the Taobao and Tmall e-commerce platforms, shoppers can take out month-to-month loans of up to RMB 30,000 (US$4,300) and are expected to repay loans one month after receiving the product. The option to use Huabei to pay for purchases is available at check-out and advertised throughout the site. On Single's Day 2016, Taobao and Tmall consumers spent a total of RMB 26.8 billion (US$3.9 billion) using the Huabei platform.</p><p>In many cases, Alibaba was lending its own money as part of its lending arm, which is now part of Ant Financial. In 2016, Ant Financial even went so far as to underwrite its consumer lending by selling asset-backed securities (ABS) against the loans. Institutional investors could purchase the ABS through Chongqing Alibaba Small Loan, which provided the underlying loans themselves.24 Effectively, people were \"investing in Singles' Day\" and Ant Financial was able to tap a large source of funding for its loans.</p><p>A Brief on Quick Response (QR) codes</p><p>Although mobile payments have existed in China since 2009, the mobile payment industry faced many of the same teething challenges in China that it faced elsewhere around the world: poor device interoperability, conflicting technology standards, and unclear customer / data ownership. By 2010, all three of China's telecommunication companies (China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom) were pursuing mobile payment pilots.</p><p>In early 2010, a wave of quick-response of \"QR\" code startups emerged in China. A QR code consists of black squares of varying sizes and positions arranged in a square grid on a white background. The code can be read by an imaging device such as a phone camera or a simple hand scanner.</p><p>Although Alipay and Tenpay were making inroads in online payments, they had yet to break into proximity offline payments because of the monopolistic control of China UnionPay and the mobile operators, but QR codes offered a viable solution. QR codes were secure, easy to use, and were already familiar to customers.</p><p>Yet, the key advantage is that they are hardware agnostic. To get UnionPay or a handset manufacturer to embed an Alipay technology would have been incredibly difficult and costly, as would attempting to penetrate the NFC payments market. However, with an app-based QR code, Alipay and Tencent only needed consumers to download the app to their smartphone to gain access to the payment functionality. Alipay was actually the first to use QR codes for payments when it launched QR payment in December 2011. WeChat followed in September 2012 with QR codes for both exchanging contact details and for payment. By May 2016, Alipay QR code payment acceptance reached 600,000 brick-and-mortar merchants across China. Each has their own set of QR codes that users can scan with their phone and pay, or by using 'quick-pay' functionality, a user can display a dynamic (changes every 30 seconds) QR code to a merchant who scans the code with a device to complete the transaction.</p><p>QR-code based mobile payments seem to have caught on in China for a number of reasons:</p><p>. Platform agnostic - Both the Alipay and WeChat pay app work across the Android and Apple iOS platforms, which account for 99.3% of China's smartphone market in urban areas.</p><p>. Easy to use - Users unlock their phone and click on an icon to show an auto-refreshing QR code that can be scanned by the merchant.</p><p>. Inexpensive - Users make transactions for free and receive points that can be exchanged for gifts or credit. On average, merchants pay 0.6% to process digital payment transactions through WeChat Pay or Alipay.</p><p>. Ubiquitous - Over 600,000 merchants accept Alipay payments. On a promotional day where WeChat charged no merchant fees for using its network, 700,000 accepted WeChat Pay in China.</p><p>Today, millions of stores across China accept QR-code based Alipay and WeChat Pay mobile payments and the technology is being trialed in many other countries across Asia.</p><p>China Fintech Today</p><p>The breadth and depth of the digital financial products and services available in China today is impressive. As detailed above, mobile payments provided the basic foundation on which many of the subsequent products and services were built including wealth management, credit rating and lending.</p><p>In addition to Ant Financial and Tencent, many other players have gotten into finance including Xiaomi, one of China's largest smartphone manufacturers, JD.com, another e-commerce platform and Baidu, China's largest search engine. Xiaomi itself has payment, wealth management and lending platforms. New industry segments have grown rapidly as well. P2P lending started in China in about 2007 and has since grown to be a $60 billion industry.25 In fact, China now boasts 4 of the world's top-5 fintech unicorns.</p><p>Platform Ecosystem</p><p>Since their launch, both the Alipay and WeChat products have become what could essentially be considered lifestyle platforms, allowing users to buy anything from movie tickets to taxi rides and flights, to wealth management products.</p><p>This distinction between similar products and services in the U.S. is important one when trying to understand China's fintech market and market dynamics. Although WeChat at its core is very similar to WhatsApp: they both are chat apps, the similarities end there.</p><p>When you open the mobile wallet, the true breadth of the WeChat ecosystem is apparent. A user can execute many functions on one app, something that would take several apps in the US to do. As an example, from within the WeChat app, you can:</p><p>. Book a card or taxi, similar to Uber</p><p>. Invest in wealth management products, like WealthFront or Betterment</p><p>. Pay utilities like you would with Citi or Prism</p><p>So, although mobile payments were the entry point for China's large technology companies into enter the Chinese fintech market, they have now become the plumbing to a wide variety of other products and services which allows a significant amount of cross- selling. When everything is contained on one app, why do you need to look elsewhere?</p><p>More importantly, the platform approach leads to an incredible amount of transactional data. Knowing what consumers are purchasing, where they are taking taxis, etc., allows you to move closer to the idea of 'situational finance' where financial providers can provide the right product at the right time to the right person.</p><p>This combination of payments, platforms and data have put China's big tech companies in a very strong market position, both in the context of tech companies in general as well as the financial industry. This is having an impact. Banks' traditional business of payments and investment products is decreasing and they are scrambling to find a response. In 2016 alone, over $30 billion in payment fees were lost to the mobile payment platforms of Alipay and WeChat Pay.</p><p>The Response of the Traditional Financial Industry</p><p>China's traditional financial industry including banks, asset managers, payment providers and payment networks (e.g. UnionPay), have struggled to respond to the growing threat of digital finance. One bank manager that we spoke to told us: \"Forget about payments, that battle is lost. Help us with the rest of our businesses.\" There are few reasons for this:</p><p>. Lack of Agility - China's Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is the largest bank in the world with 22,000 branches and over 400,000 staff. That is not only a huge organizational footprint, but also technology. Making changes to the core systems is challenging and has prevented many banks like ICBC from competing effectively with the tech giants.</p><p>. Business focus - Alibaba and Tencent are technology companies and are judged by the market and as such are measured by gross- merchandise value and other metrics related to payments and digital businesses. Traditional banks are measured by return on assets or equity, which hinders their ability to engage in 'moonshot' projects or activities.</p><p>. Technical ability - Although running a technology platform that can support millions of customers is impressive, many of the big banks have IT teams that are geared towards operational stability and efficiency rather than innovation. They also struggle find the right talent. Ten years ago, top college graduates would have eagerly jumped at a job in banking. Today, they are more likely interested in an Alibaba, Tencent, or one of the millions of start-ups in China.</p><p>. Regulations - Regulation on domestic banks is just as onerous as regulation on foreign banks. Even for using online banking, USB-keys and multiple maker/checker accounts are required. China's tech firms have enjoyed access to what could be considered as the world's biggest fintech sandbox.</p><p>There are some traditional players that have managed to position themselves well. Ping An Group is known to be at the forefront of fintech in China and has done a good job in making technology and innovation a key part of their business strategy. Where allowed, data is shared across the organization that can help to cross- sell products and leverage data analytics to improve the customer experience.</p><p>Banks are also setting up centers and groups within their organization to foster innovation, mimicking many of the initiatives of other banks like Singaporean lender DBS, which was one of the first banks globally to hire a Chief Innovation Officer.</p><p>Despite these efforts, China's traditional financial institutions are unlikely to be able to catch-up with the digital giants at this point, not without some help from the regulators, which they are starting to get.</p><p>The Role of China's regulators</p><p>As China's financial services industry is less developed than that of many other countries and is a key lever for the country's economic development, industry regulators have always focused on maintaining stable industry growth. This has so far meant relatively slow and measured reform, and openness to foreign firms than many had hoped.</p><p>As an example, as part of the 2001 WTO commitment, China agreed to open the domestic banking industry to foreign banks, but much to the chagrin of foreign players, it was only in 2006 that they finally accepted applications for local licenses. HSBC was one the first to receive a license in 2007. Up until a few years ago, if a foreign bank opened a branch in a rich city, they had to do so in a poorer one. Also until a few years ago, foreign banks establishing branches in China could do foreign currency (USD) business but were prohibited for 3 years to do local RMB business. Imagine a Chinese bank coming to the US and being told they could not do USD business.</p><p>Although they were technically committed to the WTO agreement, realistically, if China had immediately fully opened the financial industry to foreign players in 2001, or even shortly after, the sector would have collapsed along with the economy itself. The measured approach allowed both the regulators and the existing players to prepare for the entrance of foreign competitors.</p><p>Wait and See</p><p>Despite the relatively closed industry, China has become the world's biggest fintech sandbox as home-grown 3rd-party players like Ant Financial and Tencent have been allowed to thrive.</p><p>These players grew in industry segments that were previously very lightly regulated. Mobile payment companies were licensed in 2011, but regulations on business scope and operations were promulgated in 2015-2016. So, licenses were needed a full eight years after the platforms were launched in 2003-2004, and specific regulations only came 4-5 years after that. Similarly, the first P2P lending platform launched in China in 2007. The government then did not regulate the industry until 2016.</p><p>This \"wait and see\" regulatory approach allowed various segments of China's fintech industry to grow and develop within limits. As mentioned previously, mobile payments in China have helped to drive financial inclusion and economic empowerment across the country, a net benefit for the industry and the economy. It was only when the industry reached a substantial size that regulators started to ring-fence the behavior of the mobile payment companies.</p><p>Similarly with P2P lending. Shadow finance and lending has been a challenge for regulators in China. While shadow finance has helped borrowers that are not able to access traditional sources of funding, it is very risky as the loans are not tremendously transparent and often come with usurious interest rates. Yet, if the government seriously cracked down on shadow finance, there would be a significant dent to China's economic growth as the segment is so large.</p><p>P2P, although not a complete replacement for shadow finance, did help slow the industry growth. As borrowers realized they could access capital on the P2P lending platforms, some of the historically shadow-funded borrowing, moved onto the P2P platforms. Yet again, in 2016, after a number of P2P lenders closed down, the regulators issued regulations which will be in effect this August controlling the operational practices of the P2P platforms (e.g. usage of custodial banks) as well as the amounts that can be borrowed.</p><p>Future fintech regulation</p><p>Although the regulators and government have been very supportive of fintech's growth in China, they are starting to gradually take back some control in certain segments.</p><p>As an example, the market leaders Alipay and WeChat Pay currently run across their own 'payment rails' meaning that the transactions do not go across the China UnionPay or bank networks. Although this has resulted in a loss of fees for the banks and China UnionPay, the bigger issue is the data, which is becoming increasingly important as mentioned previously.</p><p>Earlier in 2017, the PBOC launched the 'WangLian' platform, which can be thought of as a China UnionPay network for digital payments. Whereas previously a mobile payment would have gone through just the Alipay network, it is expected that at the end of the 2017, most mobile and online payments will be required to go through the WangLian network.</p><p>While the WangLian platform should provider interoperability between payment platforms and may help to ensure the industry growth continues unabated, realistically it is an attempt by regulators to take back control of an industry that has gotten away from them. It may also be a saving grace to the banks, who have largely been left out of China fintech's development so far.</p><p>Previously the government has been very open to fintech's growth in China, but the regulations over the past few years as well as the setup of the WangLIan platform may mean that the heady days of fintech growth are behind us. Should the government continue to regulator the industry, certainly some of the power will go back to the incumbent players from the disruptors.</p><p>Barriers to Entry for Foreign Fintech Players</p><p>Over the past decade, China's financial industry has developed rapidly and has gradually opened up to foreign players. Most of the large multinational banks, insurers, and asset managers have operations in China.</p><p>Still, there are some barriers to entry across the financial industry in all the sub-segments. For example, foreign companies have not been allowed to IPO on domestic Chinese markets and only a handful of foreign brokerages have been given licenses to operate in mainland China, and even then, mainly through JVs. Most well-known is likely the fact that Visa, MasterCard and their competitors are unable to operate domestic businesses in China. [See Appendix A. for more details.]</p><p>Within the fintech space, there are very few successful foreign companies. This lack of success typically comes from one of two reasons: operational mistakes by the fintech company or explicit regulations preventing foreign companies from operating in a segment.</p><p>PayPal originally entered China in the early 2000s. Its failure initially was due to a series of well-known and acknowledged missteps, and it was never able to capture significant domestic market share. PayPal was then not one of the 270 companies awarded a payments license in 2011-2012. In fact, to date, only two foreign companies were given payments licenses: Edenred and Sodexo, which both received pre-paid card licenses. Beyond payments, there are some successful 3rd party foreign players in China's fintech industry, although they are mainly foreign entrepreneurs who have setup domestic businesses in China. Saul Hilte, one of the founders of Lending Club in the U.S., set up Dianrong, Shanghai's largest P2P platform. Greg Gibbs was part of the original management team at Lufax, which is set for an IPO later this year.</p><p>The other avenue of entry is through infrastructure. Companies like Intel, IBM, FIS, FirstData and Microsoft have been in China for years providing software and hardware to the financial industry. Yet foreign companies are not allowed to directly provide cloud services, so Amazon, Microsoft and others have joint-ventures in China.</p><p>China's 2017 Cyber-security ruling</p><p>In June 2017, China's new cyber-security regulation will go live. The regulations cover a number of items around Chinese customer data, code escrow and other topics that China has indicated they feel are important for internal security.</p><p>There have been numerous legal firms that have analyzed the rules in more detail. For the financial industry and fintech, the rules are not entirely new as for many years Chinese customer data was required to stay in China and code escrow was often a requirement in contract negotiations.</p><p>Recommendations</p><p>Despite the challenges in and around China's financial industry, the correct tactic is continued engagement, but with a slightly different approach. There are a four key elements of engagement around China and fintech that are critical for the U.S. government to focus on going forward:</p><p>1. Apply a more rigorous approach to bi/multi-lateral agreements</p><p>2. Focus on the new financial industry battlegrounds</p><p>3. Examine the implications China fintech's international expansion</p><p>4. Implement reciprocal domestic U.S. regulations on foreign fintech participants</p><p>Apply a more rigorous approach to bi/multi-lateral agreements</p><p>From all of the reporting and news, it would appear that the new U.S. administration has ramped up its engagement with China after the meeting at Mar-a-Lago and efforts since, and at least it appears a dialogue has started. Although this is positive, the details will be critical. For many of these agreements to move beyond talking points and PR exercises, the negotiations and agreements need additional detail to be effective as there are several examples of high-level agreements with China that did not lead to actual implementation.</p><p>The first example is domestic China market access for the card clearing and settlement systems of Visa, MasterCard and similar card schemes. Although China has agreed at a high-level to allow payment players to come in and launch RMB businesses, the reality on the ground is that they could be allowed to operate, but the operational requirements are challenging.</p><p>We were told by one of the card networks that the Chinese regulators told them they had the green light to setup the domestic core-systems needed for processing payments. The company implemented the required domestic core-systems and infrastructure, but then one of the regulators audited the system and found an issue around security. The finding was not entirely clear in the initial guidelines, but nevertheless, the card network was told to re-design significant parts of the system, costing them about 9 months and presumably a significant amount of money. The detail of the core-systems would have been a minute detail had it been included in the overall WTO agreement, but it needed to be included.</p><p>Similarly, although foreign banks are now operating in China relatively unencumbered, had the details around business requirements been defined from the outset, the time to market could have been shortened. That is not to say that in either case the Chinese government was not justified in the regulations that they promulgated. They do have a vested interest in seeing the continued development in the industry, but had the details been discussed earlier, these situations could have potentially been mitigated.</p><p>Because of this, any future regulatory efforts need to 1. be very detailed, 2. have a team in-place to ensure both all of the details are covered in the text as well as correctly implemented, and 3. define consequences if guidelines are not met. It cannot just be assumed that if something happens at a high-level, it will be possible on an operational level. That level of detail, although tedious to implement, is critical.</p><p>The challenge with this approach is that most Chinese regulation, even purely domestic, is very high-level and somewhat grey, leaving a lot of interpretation around implementation. Further, the Chinese government typically does not like foreign intervention in markets, but it should be considered if the U.S. government wants to make more than just noise around agreements with China.</p><p>2. Focus on the new financial industry battlegrounds</p><p>Most of the financial industry engagement with China has centered on traditional segments of the financial industry. The WTO agreement in 2001 focused heavily on the banking and payments industry and the more recent 100 day plan, on credit rating and electronic payments.</p><p>Although it is important to focus on these segments, the direction of the financial industry in China has shifted. Mobile payments through QR-codes, are already accepted at millions of shops and stores across China, rapidly replacing debit and credit card transactions. Similarly, companies like Ant Finance are redefining credit rating and reporting.</p><p>Engagement with China on access to the financial industry needs to look forward. The old battles around payments and credit rating are no longer as critical as those segments lose relevance to the future of the financial industry in China. Yes, there is huge market potential for Visa and MasterCard in China, but regulations and engagement needs to be more forward looking and including things like P2P lending, mobile payments and wealth management. Even if the card companies are allowed to set up, they may not be the future of finance in China.</p><p>3. Examine the implications China fintech's international expansion As part of their overall strategy, we have seen a serious push from Alibaba, Ant Financial and Tencent to expand internationally and according to the latest numbers we have, over 300,000 merchants outside of China accept WeChat Pay and 80,000 accept Alipay.</p><p>The first countries that the tech giants focused on were the countries where the Chinese tourists go, so Thailand, HK, Singapore, etc. The second wave has included Europe and now the U.S.</p><p>This expansion has come in a few different forms: the first is investment into or acquisition of an existing player, as is the case with Alibaba's investment in PayTM in India and potentially MoneyGram in the U.S. The second is through partnership, as is the case with First Data in the U.S. and Ingenico in several European countries. Finally, they have also gone alone into particular countries like Alipay in Hong Kong. Although the expansion into these countries opens up new opportunities for the tech giants to expand their userbase and revenue opportunity, it is also having a critical impact on the payment systems in those target countries.</p><p>In some cases, such as Hong Kong, there is very little mobile payment activity, so launching a mobile payment product augments the existing payments infrastructure. In many cases however, the payment infrastructure is not as robust as in other countries, or completely non-existent. Because of this, in places like India and Africa, Alibaba and Tencent are having an outsized impact as an increasingly large segment of the population is going digital and using mobile payments.</p><p>Given that payment systems are so critical to the development and growth of countries, having influence and sway over the payment system in a foreign country could potentially include political influence, especially in those countries with underdeveloped payment systems. As Ant Financial and Tencent are heavily Chinese government supported (formally through investment and informally through political networks), it also means that the Chinese government, by proxy, has a potentially outsized influence in those countries.</p><p>As the U.S. evaluates its foreign policy, this cannot be understated: the expansion of China's fintech giants into other markets' payment systems gives them, and the Chinese government, outsized influence on financial industry regulation and policy, and potentially, overall political policy. This in many cases will help the target countries as China continues to fund overseas development, but it also raises a potential challenge to the U.S.'s national security interests which may be weakened through this expansion. Particular attention needs to be focused on this market segment to ensure that the U.S. government is aware of and comfortable with the implications.</p><p>4. Reciprocal domestic US regulations on foreign participants</p><p>One of the advantages of the U.S. financial industry and specifically fintech, is the openness of the market. Not only does the U.S. have excellent home-grown fintech companies like Lending Club, Lemonade, and Prosper, the market structure is such that foreign companies can also enter the U.S. market. This applies across the board: the U.S. has one of the most advance and robust financial industries in the world, populated by banks, brokers, asset managers and more from all over the world.</p><p>Although this has worked previously, it needs to be re-thought, specifically in the context of fintech for two reasons:</p><p>Firstly, for reasons mentioned previously, access to payment systems and the correspondent influence of the Chinese government in the tech giants represents a special case and affects national security and policy. Secondly, even as there are few limitations on what Chinese firms can do in the U.S., American firms are very much limited in what they can do in China. I do not typically support tit for tat reciprocal regulations, but believe this to be a special case, where it should certainly be on the table for consideration: there is no reason why products like Alipay are allowed to expand and grow in the U.S. while U.S. firms, like PayPal, struggle to gain market access in China.</p><p>This review of reciprocal regulations and restrictions should apply not just to China, but any markets where this is happening.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Although the fintech industry globally is relatively young, the impact is nowhere greater than it is in China. By any measure, China's fintech industry dwarfs any market globally whether it is by assets under management, volume of transactions or valuation of the companies.</p><p>This has helped drive economic empowerment and financial inclusion in China as digital-finance becomes a way of life for Chinese individuals. Although there are risks, the benefits certainly outweigh any drawbacks, especially as the regulators walk the fine line of maintaining industry stability, while at the same time fostering innovation.</p><p>As these platforms expand internationally, it is a critical time for the U.S. government and regulators to re-evaluate their approach to fintech regulation, especially for China's fintech companies. The game has shifted and so have the players, a new approach is not just recommended, but required for the U.S. to maintain its position of importance on the global stage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGTST-20179200008236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGTST2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NVH-D5M1-F113-H0MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

What's next for him and the network following another rough departure?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Welcome back to EARLY START, everybody.  I'm Dave Briggs.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> KOSIK:  Good morning. </p><p> BRIGGS:  Good morning. </p><p> KOSIK:  I'm Alison Kosik.  It's 30 minutes past the hour.  </p><p> And this morning, the Trump administration is not backing off the tough talk in several fights.  It is waging around the world with Iran, North Korea and with Russia, too.  </p><p> On the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the deal forged by the Obama administration and U.S. allies, quote, \"completely ignored all the other serious threats that Iran poses.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests, in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel.  An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  Tillerson's comments coming a day after he certified Congress that Iran is complying with the deal, but questions whether sanctions shouldn't be re-imposed because of Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism.  </p><p> KOSIK:  Now, you we heard secretary Tillerson mentioning North Korea, which already has sky high tensions with its neighbors and the U.S. Well, today, American and South Korean forces are conducting their annual Max Thunder Drill.  That's the second largest military aviation exercise on the Korean peninsula.  </p><p>CNN's Paula Hancocks is at the Kunsan Air Base in Seoul with an up- close look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Dave and Alison, this is Max Thunder.  This is a massive air operation between the United States and South Korea here in South Korea.  There is more than 80 aircrafts involved in this.  That's more than 1,500 people.  </p><p> We know that it's routine.  We know that it's annual.  We are told by the lieutenant colonel in charge that they weren't actually carrying out these drills, they don't have a specific enemy in mind.  But, of course, given the tensions on the Korean Peninsula, this is inevitably going to be more in the spotlight.  </p><p> This kind of massive firepower being seen by North Korea as well.  It is not what North Korea likes to see.  Every single year when these drills happen, they become angry, infuriated.  They believe that this is actually a dress rehearsal for an invasion, even though the United States say that they are defensive in nature.  </p><p> But just bear in mind what's happening on the peninsula at this point. North Korea have said that the U.S. pushed the situation to a point where a nuclear war can break out at any time.  China as well suggests these military drills should not be happening, saying that if the U.S. halts these military drills, potentially, North Korea could suspend the nuclear and missile program.  </p><p> It's not a new situation.  It's not a new suggestion and it's not one the U.S. welcomes.</p><p> Dave and Alison, back to you.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BRIGGS:  Indeed.  Paula Hancocks, thank you.  </p><p> The White House is denying it misled the public when it announced last week the USS Vinson was heading to the Korean Peninsula when it was actually sailing in the opposite direction.  It was President Trump who informed the nation a powerful armada was on the way.  But the aircraft carrier group was actually thousands of miles to the southwest in the Indian Ocean at the time.  </p><p> Listen to White House spokesman Sean Spicer disputing the notion that the American people, let alone our adversaries and allies, were misled.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The statement that was put out was that the Carl Vinson group was headed to the Korean Peninsula and it is headed to the Korean Peninsula.  It will arrive there.  </p><p> REPORTER:  It's headed there now.  It wasn't headed there last week.</p><p> SPICER:  Sure.  No, no, but that's not what we ever said.  We said it was heading there.  It was heading there.  It is heading there.  </p><p> REPORTER:  The president believed he might have spoken too quickly on this location of the vessel.  </p><p> SPICER:  The president said that we have an armada going towards the peninsula.  That's a fact.  It has happened, it is happening, rather.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  The Pentagon has still not provided a clear explanation for failing to correct the actual location of the USS Vinson for at least a week now.</p><p> KOSIK:  Meantime, Russia has derailed the United States' proposal to condemn North Korea for its latest nuclear missile test.  A no vote from the Kremlin killing the motion even though the other 14 Security Council members were all onboard, including China.  The statement called on North Korea to immediately halt further nuclear tests.  The rogue nation has already conducted at least five nuclear tests in defiance of the U.N.</p><p> BRIGGS:  The White House still hoping against odds to get a health care deal done during President Trump's first 100 days in office. Now, two factions of the Republican Party are in talks as we speak.  </p><p> [04:35:02] Mark Meadows of the Conservative House Freedom Caucus and Tom Macarthur of the more moderate Tuesday Group trying to find some common ground on repealing Obamacare.  So, the freedom caucus, they want it gutted.  The Tuesday group favors keeping key elements.  </p><p> KOSIK:  A senior Republican official telling CNN reaching a consensus will be a long shot.  Vice President Pence onboard the USS Ronald Reagan telling CNN's Dana Bash he is confident an agreement will be reached by next week and the president is determined to keep his promise on health care reform.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Congressman Jason Chaffetz, the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announcing he will not seek reelection in 2018.  The Utah Republican insisting he has no ulterior motives and simply wants to return to the private sector back home in Utah. Chaffetz is best known for heading up the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server as secretary of state.  He has in the past expressed an interest in becoming the governor of Utah.  </p><p> KOSIK:  Todd Ricketts is withdrawing his nomination as deputy commerce secretary.  Ricketts spent about $1 million of his own money helping to get President Trump elected.  His family owns the Chicago Cubs. His father founded TD Ameritrade.  And sources close to Ricketts say he struggled to reconcile his family's complicated finances with the Office of Government Ethics.  It's the latest wave of high ranking staff elections who stepped aside before their confirmation hearings even got started, all of them citing conflicts of interest concerns.  </p><p> Ricketts follows three other mega-rich nominees who have dropped out of consideration for Trump administration posts.  You see them there. Vincent Viola, who Trump nominated for secretary of the army, Andy Puzder who was to join the cabinet as secretary of labor, and Philip Bilden who Trump nominated for the secretary of navy.  </p><p> Watchdogs and some Democrats will say this is the result of appropriate ethics law.  But there is a flipside, are those laws helping keep successful qualified people from taking top government posts?  Hmm.  You can ponder that question.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Yes, we can.  Yes, there is a lot of conflicts when you have that kind of money.  There is a lot of complex ties.  </p><p> KOSIK:  And then you have those who will say, listen, I'm not willing to cut those ties.  I rather bow out.  And you have others who say, you know what, we're going to intermingle and maybe see what we can get away with.</p><p> BRIGGS:  Plenty of wealth left in that cabinet.  </p><p> Another major piece of the FOX News puzzle is out.  What's next for Bill O'Reilly?  What's next for FOX News now the two have parted ways? </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [04:41:49] BRIGGS:  Well, in a decision rocking the world of cable news, Bill O'Reilly, the long-time host of FOX News flagship show \"The O'Reilly Factor\", is out.  The network finally yielding to public pressure as years of sexual harassment claims piled up.  </p><p> KOSIK:  Joining us to talk about this, Joe Concha, a former FOX News writer and now, a media reporter for the Capital Hill journal \"The Hill\", and from Los Angeles, CNN legal analyst and civil rights attorney, Areva Martin.  Good morning to you both.  </p><p> Joe, I'm going to start with you to walk us through what the final straw was, because it seems like this sexual harassment by O'Reilly was sort of the worst kept secret at FOX.  Was it money?  Was it the advertisers?  Or was it how he made FOX appear?  Was it a PR thing?  </p><p> JOE CONCHA, THE HILL:  You are a business gal once, right?  </p><p> KOSIK:  Yes.</p><p> CONCHA:  You know follow the money.  So, when 50 advertisers, more than, leave and aren't coming back and any company that even thinks about advertising on \"The O'Reilly Factor\", Media Matters and left wing groups will shame them out of existence, how could you support somebody who is accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and paid out $13 millions.  </p><p> Fox saw that scenario and more women coming forward, whether the claims are valid or not, as constantly dominating their news cycle saying, you know what, Megyn Kelly left, no problem.  We took our Tucker Carlson and filled that role, increased ratings, actually.  We could do the same with Carlson again.  He has been in three time slots now -- time slots at that network in three months.  We can do it again with O'Reilly.  We can move \"The Five\" to 9:00 and he is expendable. </p><p> Amazingly, that seems to be the thought process.  Check out next week when this new schedule comes out.  If they're down 20 to 30 percent, FOX has a big problem.  If they kind of stay around the green, so to speak, to use a golf term -- 10 percent off -- then you know what? They survive this I think.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Just about impossible to match the ratings.  You are right. But somewhere close they survive it.  </p><p> All right.  Areva, Wendy Walsh who played a key role perhaps in this ouster saying, today, we have entered a new era in work place politics.  Have we?  </p><p> AREVA MARTIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  I don't think so.  I'm really concerned about what's going on at FOX.  We still have this lawsuit from Julie Roginsky against Bill Shine and against other executives, claiming that they were complicit, that they knew about the Roger Ailes harassment of her and that they took no action.  In fact, she claims they retaliated against her.  </p><p> So, when we think about the culture here, we have to ask, is getting rid of Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes enough to change the culture at FOX if the harassment was as widespread as we are learning from all of these allegations?  It's going to take more than two terminations to change that culture.  </p><p> Look, it's very difficult to change any corporate culture and one as entrenched as this one at FOX, it's going to take a lot more than these terminations.  </p><p> KOSIK:  You know, one thing that is expected to change, Joe, the ratings, because, you know, you look at O'Reilly, \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" that was a ratings monster.  It will be hard to match that. How does FOX recover from that?  They are putting their trust in Tucker Carlson, but their bench is not that deep. </p><p> [04:45:05] Where did they go?  How do they compete like they did a week or two ago?  </p><p> CONCHA:  Let me tell you how hard it's going to be to replace Bill O'Reilly, because he has been on the air for 21 years there.  He has been number one for 16 of those years.  He is not only a host that people like.  He is a part of people's families.  They eat dinner and they watch O'Reilly.  </p><p> I know this I can go back to when I was home.  My father would put on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" and he sent me a text, just today, last tonight, as soon as I got up.  He said, \"Here's the difference on O'Reilly, he's not on tonight.  I would rather watch the Yankees.  O'Reilly was must-watch TV.\"  </p><p> That's the difference.  That's what the people have to keep with Tucker Carlson.  </p><p> KOSIK:  People have to look beyond what he did behind the scenes.  </p><p> CONCHA:  Absolutely, because they're selfish, because they like the show.  He wasn't charged with anything.  He paid them off.  He was protecting his kids by paying people off like you said.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  We'll get to that next hour, because you've got some insight on this story.  </p><p> CONCHA:  He's a better looking guy than me and he's 6'3\".  I'm 5'9\". I got screwed.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  All right.  So, Areva, perhaps a little pushback.  You know, again, full disclosure.  I worked there, as did Joe.  It may not be corporate culture as a couple isolated incidents, broadcasters, and Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly may have been separate from the corporate culture as a whole.  </p><p> But what is the next legal battle there at FOX?  </p><p> MARTIN:  Well, there is a pending lawsuit against Roger Ailes.  What we are hearing from FOX is there is this investigation.  We know they hired Paul Weiss, the law firm, to investigate the claims made against Bill O'Reilly.  I would hope what's next is that they keep moving forward in terms of building the trust of its employees.  </p><p> We heard FOX say that not one person called that hotline that was supposed to be available for people to call if they felt like they experienced harassment in the work place.  It's a little strange for a company that size to say not one person used that hotline.  That says to me as a lawyer, a civil rights lawyer, that there is no trust amongst those employees.  </p><p> So, hopefully, they move forward in building that trust so that if people do feel like they have been harassed, they can come forward, talk to H.R., talk to individuals in the work place and it can be eliminated.  </p><p> Look, one thing that's good about all of this is that, hopefully, that secretary, that administrative assistant, that woman is sitting there that may feel like she suffered harassment, she is empowered and emboldened to come forward.  </p><p> CONCHA:  Actions speak louder than words, guys.  In this case the Murdochs, at least, they took the sports analogies, this is personal, let's go through the past.  Right?  Basically, Roger Ailes was Bill Belichick for the New England Patriots.  And O'Reilly is Tom Brady, imagine that owner getting rid of both of them.  </p><p> So, I understand there is still some work to do.  But they brought from an outside firm to do investigation, instead of doing their own. And now, two of the biggest names the brains of the organization, Ailes and the face of cable news, O'Reilly are out.  Those are positive steps.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Patriots look pretty good with Jimmy Garoppolo.  I'm just saying.  </p><p> Joe Concha, Areva Martin, thanks for your insights this morning.  </p><p> KOSIK:  All right.  More bad headlines for Wells Fargo this morning. Federal regulators had 700 chances to stop the fake account scandal, but failed.  We'll explain when we get a check on CNN Money Stream, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [04:52:30] KOSIK:  Welcome back.  </p><p> Developing this morning, tens of thousands taking to the streets of the nation's capital of Caracas and the biggest anti-government protests they've seen in years.  A Venezuela national guard sergeant killed during the protests.  A second guardsman hit by a bullet.  </p><p> Protesters, as you can see, are demanding elections, and they're denouncing critical food shortages, and what they say is increasingly authoritarian government.</p><p> Police using tear gas to disburse the crowd.  Hundreds of people were arrested.  Two people were killed during the protest, but the circumstances remain unclear.  The public prosecutor's office is calling for an investigation into the fatal shooting.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  The Syrian government now seeking shelter for its combat planes following the U.S. missile strike earlier this month.  That strike in retaliation nor the chemical weapons attack the U.S. says Syria launched on its own people.</p><p>CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr has the details.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT:  Dave, Alison, the U.S. missile strike in Syria now reverberating across the Syrian military.  </p><p> That missile strike took out about 20 percent of Syria's operational fighter jets.  And now, the Syrians have apparently moved most of the rest of their inventory to a base along the coast, quite close to the Russians, looking for that Russian umbrella of protection with Russian anti-air systems, Russian missiles.  And they keep the Syrian aircraft safe.  But they can still launch additional attacks using their helicopters, artillery and rockets.  </p><p> So, while the Syrians may think that they have solved their problem, there's no indication, yet, that the Trump administration is calling it a day on any future attacks against the Syrians if they use chemical weapons again -- Alison, Dave.   (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KOSIK:  OK.  Barbara Starr, thanks for that.  </p><p> And the U.S.-led coalition reporting a dramatic increase in ISIS' use of chemical weapons in Iraq.  According to U.S. defense officials, there have been at least four incidents in the last week of ISIS fighters using chemical weapons including mustard gas in Mosul.  No deaths or coalition casualties have resulted from the attack.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  New military conduct regulations ban Navy and Marine personnel from distributing nude photos without the permission of the person depicted.  The new rule effectively makes any violation a crime that can be enforced by a military court.  This comes on the heels of a nude photo sharing scandal that has rocked all four branches of the military with photos of naked female service members being posted on Marines United and other websites.  </p><p> [04:55:09] Also this morning, an attorney hired by the family of Aaron Hernandez says he will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the disgraced former NFL star.  Corrections officials say Hernandez was found hanged in his prison cell in an apparent suicide. His death coming just days after he was acquitted in a double murder case.  </p><p> Hernandez, of course, was already serving, though, a life sentence without parole for the killing of Odin Lloyd.  The Massachusetts chief medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.  </p><p> KOSIK:  All right.  Let's get a check on CNN Money Stream this morning.  Stock futures pointing higher this morning.  Shares in Europe are mixed.  And stock markets in Asia closed mostly higher overnight.  We are seeing lingering unease from tensions in Asia, plus more profit reports coming in this morning.  </p><p> This corporate earnings season, first quarter earning season kind of off to a rocky start.  You look at shares of IBM falling off a cliff, sinking almost 5 percent.  That was after the company's profit beat estimates.  </p><p> But here's the thing that investors didn't like -- revenue missing badly, investors dumping the stock as a result.  IBM is one of the first big tech companies to report.  So investors are going to be closely watching that sector over the next few weeks.  </p><p> Big Blue weighed on the Dow, though, dragging the average to its second straight triple digit loss.  The NASDAQ is actually up for the week.  The S&amp;P 500 is sitting flat.  </p><p> KOSIK:  A troubling government report on Wells Fargo showing regulators failed to act on hundreds if not thousands of red flags. An internal review published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one particularly alarming red flag that went unheeded, in January of 2010, the regulator was aware of 700 cases of whistleblower complaints about Wells Fargo's sales tactics.   The report says regulators failed to confront executives or the company's board of directors.  It says the board knew about its sales practices as early as 2004.  Wells Fargo declined to comment on the new findings.  That's really disheartening.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  How in the world did they miss that?  </p><p> KOSIK:  Apparently they looked the other way.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Institutional failure there.  Well, the Gronk feeling at home at 1,600 Pennsylvania Ave.  The fun loving New England Patriots star visiting the White House on Wednesday when he decided to crash the briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer.  Check it out.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEAN SPICER, WIHTE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We will see what pans out in negotiation, but I think there is an option -- can I just -- </p><p> ROB GRONKOWSKI, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS:  You need some help?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SPICER:  I think I got this, but thank you.  Maybe.  All right, thanks, man.  I'll see you.  </p><p> Hold on.  All right.  That was cool.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  It was.  It would have been a whole lot cooler had he waved Gronk to the podium let him take a few questions.  </p><p> KOSIK:  That's the one thing that those briefings need, a little levity here and there. </p><p> BRIGGS:  Everything needs a little Gronk. </p><p> KOSIK:  He should come every day.</p><p> BRIGGS:  No question.</p><p> KOSIK:  All right.  Facing a slew of adversaries, the Trump administration is standing firm -- and EARLY START is continuing right now.  </p><p> (MUSIC)</p><p> KOSIK:  Facing a slew of adversaries, the Trump administration is standing firm.  Iran and North Korea, Russia, all on notice.  We have the latest on the diplomatic stare-downs.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  And the king of cable news dethroned.  Bill O'Reilly is out at FOX.  We have his reaction.  What's next following another black eye for the network? </p><p> Good morning, everybody.  Thanks for getting an EARLY START with us. I'm Dave Briggs.  </p><p> KOSIK:  Good morning.  I'm Alison Kosik.  It's Thursday, April 28th. It's 5:00 a.m. in the East.  </p><p> And this morning, the Trump administration not backing off the tough talk in several fights it's waging around the world, with Iran, North Korea and with Russia.  On the Iraq nuclear deal, President Trump has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchanger for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.  </p><p> BRIGGS:  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says the deal forged by the Obama administration and U.S. allies, quote, \"completely ignored all the other serious threats that Iran poses.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REX TILLERSON, SECRETARY OF STATE:  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests, in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel.  An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIGGS:  Now, Tillerson's comments came a day after he certified to Congress that Iran is complying with the deal, but questioned whether sanctions shouldn't be re-imposed because of Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism.  </p><p> [Byline: Dave Briggs, Alison Kosik, Paula Hancocks, Areva Martin, Barbara Starr] [Guest: Joe Concha] [High: On the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.

I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KOSIK: Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: Good morning.</p><p>KOSIK: I'm Alison Kosik. It's 30 minutes past the hour.</p><p>And this morning, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is not backing off the tough talk in several fights. It is waging around the world with Iran, North Korea and with Russia, too.</p><p>On the Iran nuclear deal, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.</p><p>BRIGGS: <person><nameText>Secretary of State </nameText></person><person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>says the deal forged by the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>and U.S. allies, quote, \"completely ignored all the other serious threats that Iran poses.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>REX TILLERSON, </nameText></person><person><nameText>SECRETARY OF STATE</nameText></person>: Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests, in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel. An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Tillerson's comments coming a day after he certified Congress that Iran is complying with the deal, but questions whether sanctions shouldn't be re-imposed because of Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism.</p><p>KOSIK: Now, you we heard <person><nameText>secretary Tillerson </nameText></person>mentioning North Korea, which already has sky high tensions with its neighbors and the U.S. Well, today, American and South Korean forces are conducting their annual Max Thunder Drill. That's the second largest military aviation exercise on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>CNN's Paula Hancocks is at the Kunsan Air Base in Seoul with an up- close look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Dave and Alison, this is Max Thunder. This is a massive air operation between the United States and South Korea here in South Korea. There is more than 80 aircrafts involved in this. That's more than 1,500 people.</p><p>We know that it's routine. We know that it's annual. We are told by the lieutenant colonel in charge that they weren't actually carrying out these drills, they don't have a specific enemy in mind. But, of course, given the tensions on the Korean Peninsula, this is inevitably going to be more in the spotlight.</p><p>This kind of massive firepower being seen by North Korea as well. It is not what North Korea likes to see. Every single year when these drills happen, they become angry, infuriated. They believe that this is actually a dress rehearsal for an invasion, even though the United States say that they are defensive in nature.</p><p>But just bear in mind what's happening on the peninsula at this point. North Korea have said that the U.S. pushed the situation to a point where a nuclear war can break out at any time. China as well suggests these military drills should not be happening, saying that if the U.S. halts these military drills, potentially, North Korea could suspend the nuclear and missile program.</p><p>It's not a new situation. It's not a new suggestion and it's not one the U.S. welcomes.</p><p>Dave and Alison, back to you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRIGGS: Indeed. Paula Hancocks, thank you.</p><p>The White House is denying it misled the public when it announced last week the USS Vinson was heading to the Korean Peninsula when it was actually sailing in the opposite direction. It was <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>who informed the nation a powerful armada was on the way. But the aircraft carrier group was actually thousands of miles to the southwest in the Indian Ocean at the time.</p><p>Listen to White House spokesman Sean Spicer disputing the notion that the American people, let alone our adversaries and allies, were misled.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The statement that was put out was that the Carl Vinson group was headed to the Korean Peninsula and it is headed to the Korean Peninsula. It will arrive there.</p><p>REPORTER: It's headed there now. It wasn't headed there last week.</p><p>SPICER: Sure. No, no, but that's not what we ever said. We said it was heading there. It was heading there. It is heading there.</p><p>REPORTER: The president believed he might have spoken too quickly on this location of the vessel.</p><p>SPICER: The president said that we have an armada going towards the peninsula. That's a fact. It has happened, it is happening, rather.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The Pentagon has still not provided a clear explanation for failing to correct the actual location of the USS Vinson for at least a week now.</p><p>KOSIK: Meantime, Russia has derailed the United States' proposal to condemn North Korea for its latest nuclear missile test. A no vote from the Kremlin killing the motion even though the other 14 Security Council members were all onboard, including China. The statement called on North Korea to immediately halt further nuclear tests. The rogue nation has already conducted at least five nuclear tests in defiance of the U.N.</p><p>BRIGGS: The White House still hoping against odds to get a health care deal done during <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>first 100 days in office. Now, two factions of the Republican Party are in talks as we speak.</p><p>[04:35:02] Mark Meadows of the Conservative House Freedom Caucus and Tom Macarthur of the more moderate Tuesday Group trying to find some common ground on repealing Obamacare. So, the freedom caucus, they want it gutted. The Tuesday group favors keeping key elements.</p><p>KOSIK: A senior Republican official telling CNN reaching a consensus will be a long shot. Vice President Pence onboard the USS Ronald Reagan telling CNN's Dana Bash he is confident an agreement will be reached by next week and the president is determined to keep his promise on health care reform.</p><p>BRIGGS: Congressman Jason Chaffetz, the powerful chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announcing he will not seek reelection in 2018. The Utah Republican insisting he has no ulterior motives and simply wants to return to the private sector back home in Utah. Chaffetz is best known for heading up the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private e-mail server as <person><nameText>secretary of state. </nameText></person>He has in the past expressed an interest in becoming the governor of Utah.</p><p>KOSIK: Todd Ricketts is withdrawing his nomination as deputy commerce secretary. Ricketts spent about $1 million of his own money helping to get <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>elected. His family owns the Chicago Cubs. His father founded TD Ameritrade. And sources close to Ricketts say he struggled to reconcile his family's complicated finances with the Office of Government Ethics. It's the latest wave of high ranking staff elections who stepped aside before their confirmation hearings even got started, all of them citing conflicts of interest concerns.</p><p>Ricketts follows three other mega-rich nominees who have dropped out of consideration for <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>posts. You see them there. Vincent Viola, who Trump nominated for secretary of the army, Andy Puzder who was to join the cabinet as secretary of labor, and Philip Bilden who Trump nominated for the secretary of navy.</p><p>Watchdogs and some Democrats will say this is the result of appropriate ethics law. But there is a flipside, are those laws helping keep successful qualified people from taking top government posts? Hmm. You can ponder that question.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, we can. Yes, there is a lot of conflicts when you have that kind of money. There is a lot of complex ties.</p><p>KOSIK: And then you have those who will say, listen, I'm not willing to cut those ties. I rather bow out. And you have others who say, you know what, we're going to intermingle and maybe see what we can get away with.</p><p>BRIGGS: Plenty of wealth left in that cabinet.</p><p>Another major piece of the FOX Newspuzzle is out. What's next for <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly? </nameText></person>What's next for FOX Newsnow the two have parted ways?</p><p>[04:41:49] BRIGGS: Well, in a decision rocking the world of cable news, <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly, </nameText></person>the long-time host of FOX Newsflagship show \"<person><nameText>The O'Reilly Factor</nameText></person>\", is out. The network finally yielding to public pressure as years of sexual harassment claims piled up.</p><p>KOSIK: Joining us to talk about this, Joe Concha, a former FOX Newswriter and now, a media reporter for the Capital Hill journal \"The Hill\", and from Los Angeles, CNN legal analyst and civil rights attorney, Areva Martin. Good morning to you both.</p><p>Joe, I'm going to start with you to walk us through what the final straw was, because it seems like this sexual harassment by O'Reilly was sort of the worst kept secret at FOX. Was it money? Was it the advertisers? Or was it how he made FOX appear? Was it a PR thing?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL: You are a business gal once, right?</p><p>KOSIK: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: You know follow the money. So, when 50 advertisers, more than, leave and aren't coming back and any company that even thinks about advertising on \"<person><nameText>The O'Reilly Factor</nameText></person>\", Media Matters and left wing groups will shame them out of existence, how could you support somebody who is accused of sexual harassment by multiple women and paid out $13 millions.</p><p>Fox saw that scenario and more women coming forward, whether the claims are valid or not, as constantly dominating their news cycle saying, you know what, Megyn Kelly left, no problem. We took our Tucker Carlson and filled that role, increased ratings, actually. We could do the same with Carlson again. He has been in three time slots now -- time slots at that network in three months. We can do it again with O'Reilly. We can move \"The Five\" to 9:00 and he is expendable.</p><p>Amazingly, that seems to be the thought process. Check out next week when this new schedule comes out. If they're down 20 to 30 percent, FOX has a big problem. If they kind of stay around the green, so to speak, to use a golf term -- 10 percent off -- then you know what? They survive this I think.</p><p>BRIGGS: Just about impossible to match the ratings. You are right. But somewhere close they survive it.</p><p>All right. Areva, Wendy Walsh who played a key role perhaps in this ouster saying, today, we have entered a new era in work place politics. Have we?</p><p>AREVA MARTIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I don't think so. I'm really concerned about what's going on at FOX. We still have this lawsuit from Julie Roginsky against Bill Shine and against other executives, claiming that they were complicit, that they knew about the Roger Ailes harassment of her and that they took no action. In fact, she claims they retaliated against her.</p><p>So, when we think about the culture here, we have to ask, is getting rid of <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>and Roger Ailes enough to change the culture at FOX if the harassment was as widespread as we are learning from all of these allegations? It's going to take more than two terminations to change that culture.</p><p>Look, it's very difficult to change any corporate culture and one as entrenched as this one at FOX, it's going to take a lot more than these terminations.</p><p>KOSIK: You know, one thing that is expected to change, Joe, the ratings, because, you know, you look at O'Reilly, \"<person><nameText>The O'Reilly Factor,</nameText></person>\" that was a ratings monster. It will be hard to match that. How does FOX recover from that? They are putting their trust in Tucker Carlson, but their bench is not that deep.</p><p>[04:45:05] Where did they go? How do they compete like they did a week or two ago?</p><p>CONCHA: Let me tell you how hard it's going to be to replace <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly, </nameText></person>because he has been on the air for 21 years there. He has been number one for 16 of those years. He is not only a host that people like. He is a part of people's families. They eat dinner and they watch O'Reilly.</p><p>I know this I can go back to when I was home. My father would put on \"<person><nameText>The O'Reilly Factor</nameText></person>\" and he sent me a text, just today, last tonight, as soon as I got up. He said, \"Here's the difference on O'Reilly, he's not on tonight. I would rather watch the Yankees. O'Reilly was must-watch TV.\"</p><p>That's the difference. That's what the people have to keep with Tucker Carlson.</p><p>KOSIK: People have to look beyond what he did behind the scenes.</p><p>CONCHA: Absolutely, because they're selfish, because they like the show. He wasn't charged with anything. He paid them off. He was protecting his kids by paying people off like you said.</p><p>BRIGGS: We'll get to that next hour, because you've got some insight on this story.</p><p>CONCHA: He's a better looking guy than me and he's 6'3\". I'm 5'9\". I got screwed.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. So, Areva, perhaps a little pushback. You know, again, full disclosure. I worked there, as did Joe. It may not be corporate culture as a couple isolated incidents, broadcasters, and Roger Ailes and <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>may have been separate from the corporate culture as a whole.</p><p>But what is the next legal battle there at FOX?</p><p>MARTIN: Well, there is a pending lawsuit against Roger Ailes. What we are hearing from FOX is there is this investigation. We know they hired Paul Weiss, the law firm, to investigate the claims made against <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly. </nameText></person>I would hope what's next is that they keep moving forward in terms of building the trust of its employees.</p><p>We heard FOX say that not one person called that hotline that was supposed to be available for people to call if they felt like they experienced harassment in the work place. It's a little strange for a company that size to say not one person used that hotline. That says to me as a lawyer, a civil rights lawyer, that there is no trust amongst those employees.</p><p>So, hopefully, they move forward in building that trust so that if people do feel like they have been harassed, they can come forward, talk to H.R., talk to individuals in the work place and it can be eliminated.</p><p>Look, one thing that's good about all of this is that, hopefully, that secretary, that administrative assistant, that woman is sitting there that may feel like she suffered harassment, she is empowered and emboldened to come forward.</p><p>CONCHA: Actions speak louder than words, guys. In this case the Murdochs, at least, they took the sports analogies, this is personal, let's go through the past. Right? Basically, Roger Ailes was Bill Belichick for the New England Patriots. And O'Reilly is Tom Brady, imagine that owner getting rid of both of them.</p><p>So, I understand there is still some work to do. But they brought from an outside firm to do investigation, instead of doing their own. And now, two of the biggest names the brains of the organization, Ailes and the face of cable news, O'Reilly are out. Those are positive steps.</p><p>BRIGGS: Patriots look pretty good with Jimmy Garoppolo. I'm just saying.</p><p>Joe Concha, Areva Martin, thanks for your insights this morning.</p><p>KOSIK: All right. More bad headlines for Wells Fargo this morning. Federal regulators had 700 chances to stop the fake account scandal, but failed. We'll explain when we get a check on CNN Money Stream, next.</p><p>[04:52:30] KOSIK: Welcome back.</p><p>Developing this morning, tens of thousands taking to the streets of the nation's capital of Caracas and the biggest anti-government protests they've seen in years. A Venezuela national guard sergeant killed during the protests. A second guardsman hit by a bullet.</p><p>Protesters, as you can see, are demanding elections, and they're denouncing critical food shortages, and what they say is increasingly authoritarian government.</p><p>Police using tear gas to disburse the crowd. Hundreds of people were arrested. Two people were killed during the protest, but the circumstances remain unclear. The public prosecutor's office is calling for an investigation into the fatal shooting.</p><p>BRIGGS: The Syrian government now seeking shelter for its combat planes following the U.S. missile strike earlier this month. That strike in retaliation nor the chemical weapons attack the U.S. says Syria launched on its own people.</p><p>CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: Dave, Alison, the U.S. missile strike in Syria now reverberating across the Syrian military.</p><p>That missile strike took out about 20 percent of Syria's operational fighter jets. And now, the Syrians have apparently moved most of the rest of their inventory to a base along the coast, quite close to the Russians, looking for that Russian umbrella of protection with Russian anti-air systems, Russian missiles. And they keep the Syrian aircraft safe. But they can still launch additional attacks using their helicopters, artillery and rockets.</p><p>So, while the Syrians may think that they have solved their problem, there's no indication, yet, that the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is calling it a day on any future attacks against the Syrians if they use chemical weapons again -- Alison, Dave. (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KOSIK: OK. Barbara Starr, thanks for that.</p><p>And the U.S.-led coalition reporting a dramatic increase in ISIS' use of chemical weapons in Iraq. According to U.S. defense officials, there have been at least four incidents in the last week of ISIS fighters using chemical weapons including mustard gas in Mosul. No deaths or coalition casualties have resulted from the attack.</p><p>BRIGGS: New military conduct regulations ban Navy and Marine personnel from distributing nude photos without the permission of the person depicted. The new rule effectively makes any violation a crime that can be enforced by a military court. This comes on the heels of a nude photo sharing scandal that has rocked all four branches of the military with photos of naked female service members being posted on Marines United and other websites.</p><p>[04:55:09] Also this morning, an attorney hired by the family of Aaron Hernandez says he will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the disgraced former NFL star. Corrections officials say Hernandez was found hanged in his prison cell in an apparent suicide. His death coming just days after he was acquitted in a double murder case.</p><p>Hernandez, of course, was already serving, though, a life sentence without parole for the killing of Odin Lloyd. The Massachusetts chief medical examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.</p><p>KOSIK: All right. Let's get a check on CNN Money Stream this morning. Stock futures pointing higher this morning. Shares in Europe are mixed. And stock markets in Asia closed mostly higher overnight. We are seeing lingering unease from tensions in Asia, plus more profit reports coming in this morning.</p><p>This corporate earnings season, first quarter earning season kind of off to a rocky start. You look at shares of IBM falling off a cliff, sinking almost 5 percent. That was after the company's profit beat estimates.</p><p>But here's the thing that investors didn't like -- revenue missing badly, investors dumping the stock as a result. IBM is one of the first big tech companies to report. So investors are going to be closely watching that sector over the next few weeks.</p><p>Big Blue weighed on the Dow, though, dragging the average to its second straight triple digit loss. The NASDAQ is actually up for the week. The S&amp;P 500 is sitting flat.</p><p>KOSIK: A troubling government report on Wells Fargo showing regulators failed to act on hundreds if not thousands of red flags. An internal review published by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one particularly alarming red flag that went unheeded, in January of 2010, the regulator was aware of 700 cases of whistleblower complaints about Wells Fargo's sales tactics. The report says regulators failed to confront executives or the company's board of directors. It says the board knew about its sales practices as early as 2004. Wells Fargo declined to comment on the new findings. That's really disheartening.</p><p>BRIGGS: How in the world did they miss that?</p><p>KOSIK: Apparently they looked the other way.</p><p>BRIGGS: Institutional failure there. Well, the Gronk feeling at home at 1,600 Pennsylvania Ave. The fun loving New England Patriots star visiting the White House on Wednesday when he decided to crash the briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN SPICER, WIHTE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We will see what pans out in negotiation, but I think there is an option -- can I just --</p><p>ROB GRONKOWSKI, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: You need some help?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPICER: I think I got this, but thank you. Maybe. All right, thanks, man. I'll see you.</p><p>Hold on. All right. That was cool.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: It was. It would have been a whole lot cooler had he waved Gronk to the podium let him take a few questions.</p><p>KOSIK: That's the one thing that those briefings need, a little levity here and there.</p><p>BRIGGS: Everything needs a little Gronk.</p><p>KOSIK: He should come every day.</p><p>BRIGGS: No question.</p><p>KOSIK: All right. Facing a slew of adversaries, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is standing firm -- and EARLY START is continuing right now.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>KOSIK: Facing a slew of adversaries, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is standing firm. Iran and North Korea, Russia, all on notice. We have the latest on the diplomatic stare-downs.</p><p>BRIGGS: And the king of cable news dethroned. <person><nameText>Bill O'Reilly </nameText></person>is out at FOX. We have his reaction. What's next following another black eye for the network?</p><p>Good morning, everybody. Thanks for getting an EARLY START with us. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>KOSIK: Good morning. I'm Alison Kosik. It's Thursday, April 28th. It's 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p>And this morning, the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>not backing off the tough talk in several fights it's waging around the world, with Iran, North Korea and with Russia. On the Iraq nuclear deal, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has asked for a multi-agency review to determine whether lifting sanctions in exchanger for Tehran curbing its nuclear program is really in the national interest.</p><p>BRIGGS: <person><nameText>Secretary of State </nameText></person><person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>says the deal forged by the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>and U.S. allies, quote, \"completely ignored all the other serious threats that Iran poses.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>REX TILLERSON, </nameText></person><person><nameText>SECRETARY OF STATE</nameText></person>: Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining U.S. interests, in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel. An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea and take the world along with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Now, Tillerson's comments came a day after he certified to Congress that Iran is complying with the deal, but questioned whether sanctions shouldn't be re-imposed because of Iran's alleged sponsorship of terrorism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2017042002CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NC6-DT41-JB20-G00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 20, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iran</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Treaties and Agreements</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill O'Reilly</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FOX News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Television and Radio</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Syria</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

She served as chief spokesperson in Sarajevo for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE in the early 2000s and then worked with Endeavor, an organization that supports global entrepreneurs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That work led Bayrasli to meet with entrepreneurs in Turkey, Nigeria, Pakistan, Mexico, India, Russia and China to highlight global innovations that are thriving in seemingly impossible conditions.</p><p>Bayrasli will speak about her book, \"From The Other Side of the World; Extraordinary Entrepreneurs\" on Sept 19 at an event organized by the World Affairs Council of NH, held at UNH Manchester.</p><p>Q. What sparked the idea to write about entrepreneurs around the world?</p><p>A. Whenever we think about entrepreneurship tn the context of the U S., we think about Silicon Valley and Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and Microsoft and Google - the big tech companies. But when we [talk about] it outside of the U.S., it takes on a different connotation, in the sense it's women creating tchotchkes on the side of the road, not mobile payments or Wi-Fi routers that are really changing the nature of the economy of their communities and moving the needle forward.</p><p>Q. Could you tell me more about the entrepreneurs you profiled?</p><p>A. I profiled seven entrepreneurs from seven countries. They were either men or women that despite tremendous obstacles - things like poor infrastructure, bad governance, lack of an entrepreneurial culture - they still persisted to create their business, whether In Turkey, Pakistan or India.</p><p>What stood out to me was their firm belief in and their ability to see more than what we are able to see in the West. I think we dismiss things that happen around the world, and they recognize talent is not unique to a particular community or a particular country. Opportunity is not abundant around the world, but talent is something we all have.</p><p>Q. Did you notice anything different about entrepreneurs overseas?</p><p>A&gt; One thing that I noticed is entrepreneurs outside of the U.S. are much more aware of what's going on in their countries. They're aware politically, they know what relations their country is having around the world I'm shocked when I talk to entrepreneurs [in the U.S.] and they don't know what's going on in Washington. Entrepreneurs outside of the U.S. are very aware of global issues and global challenges and one of the reasons is they have to be. If they have to put their products to market, they have to know what's going on in these places. From a business point of view, it makes sense for them to be aware of these things.</p><p>Q. You currently are the co-founder of Foreign Policy Interrupted, which encourages female voices in the media. I was surprised by the statistics on your site that generally show women appear in the journals or talk shows only 20 percent of the time.</p><p>A. This is something that's persistent. It's not just the underrepresentation of women in foreign policy - I think that's true in every sector across the board, certainly in the tech space we're hearing about the challenges women face in Silicon Valley, and there are a number of factors that go into that.</p><p>I think institutionally, a lot of the regulations, a lot of the structures and routines and habits were created by white men and continue to be dominated by white men. One of the challenges is how we get different voices to contribute in different sectors, not only for the men to create space so women can come to the table, but for every issue to be a part of the discussion. It's like trying to build a house with a toolbox of only hammers. You need different tools to actually create that house and I think that goes the same for policy making, and it's true when you're creating a business and it's certainly true across the board.</p><p>GO TO NHBR.COM TO READ MORE OF THIS INTERVIEW</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHBUSR-1943077257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHBUSR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PKD-8421-JBHT-D166-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316339</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Business Publications Inc.

What a difference a year makes! During Q4 2018, the imposition of the first round of U.S. tariffs on imports from China, the cumulative impact of 200 bps of rate hikes from the Fed, and Chairman Powell's comment that the Fed's quantitative tightening program was on 'auto pilot' served to cause investors to flee from equities. Stocks took a 20% nosedive finishing down roughly 10% for 2018. A year later, Trump was cutting tariffs, the Fed had cut rates three times ...nce mid-September 2019 the Fed's balance sheet had been growing at an annualized rate of 40%. Stocks were on fire, up 22% (TSX) to 35% (NASDAQ) for the year and investors chased equities into year end. Now with elevated valuation dispersion (good for 'value' stocks) but a modest outlook for growth (good for 'growth' companies), many investors are puzzled about what to do. </p><p>After reviewing December and 2019 as a whole, this commentary will table a few thoughts and our bottom line on 2020.

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[1] To start, we're pleased to report that December 2019 was a very strong month for our funds at Forge First. The Forge First Long Short LP Class F Lead Series printed its best month of the year to end 2019 up +11.22% net of fees. Given its +8.53% net return during 2018, the two year graph below demonstrates that our Long Short fund (orange line) has handsomely outperformed Canada's TSX (blue line), and done so with significantly less volatility. The table on the below right highlights additional statistics for the fund, specifically its 1.87 Sharpe ratio, negative downside capture of -28% and strong alpha generation, which sits at 12%. The Forge First Multi Strategy LP Class F Lead Series also enjoyed a strong finish to the year. As a result, this more conservative fund which targets a lower risk profile than Long Short, captured a +5.58% net return, after its +5.44% advance during 2018, and in line with its 5 year net CAGR of 5.26%. <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-1.png;\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-1.png;</url> During December 2019, energy and materials drove the majority of our returns, as our portfolios benefited from the early Q4 tactical repositioning of the funds that we had discussed in our October[2] and November[3] commentaries. Having witnessed an apparent reversal in the trend of global manufacturing indices, alongside reduced trade rhetoric and a dovish Fed, we increased the gross and net long exposure of our funds, boosted our exposure to cyclicals, shifted from owning put spreads to put options and shorted 'bond proxies'. Utilities, industrials and technology also contributed gains to the funds while ETFs, real estate[4] and stocks in the consumer space generated modest losses.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-2.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-2.png</url> At year-end 2019, the Long Short fund held gross and net exposures of 113% and 48% respectively. The largest net long positions were in the energy, technology, materials and industrial sectors while our collective position in ETFs was the only sector the fund was net short. Index put options represented a notional exposure of -3.7% and positions in fixed income totalled 3.6%. In contrast, our Multi Strategy fund held a combined preferred share and fixed income position of 21.7% as of December 31, 2019. In addition, this fund had a net long common equity position of 21.43%. Index put options represented a further -11.4% of notional exposure such that at yearend the gross and net exposure of this fund were 112% and 44% respectively.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-3.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-3.png</url> As for broader markets, 2019 turned out to be a year to own pretty much all asset classes. Closing 2018 with the yield of 2.69% shown in the table on the above left, U.S. 10 year government bonds generated great returns for investors, especially at their post-Labour Day bottoming yield of 1.46%. Oil and gold, gaining 33.6% and 18.3% respectively on the year speak to the return potential seen in commodities (ex-natural gas). Oddly in light of the strength in equity markets, 2019 turned out to be a weak year for IPOs, with 3 of the 4 shown in the table on the above right ending the year below their launch price. Of course, it's likely not a coincidence that many 'unicorns' experienced huge reversals in their valuations, with the poster child being WeWork. Switching to public equities, other than pot stocks, all sectors on each of the TSX ......00 generated solid gains. While the technology sector was the biggest gainer on both sides of the border (+50.3% in U.S. and +64.1% on the TSX), what's particularly interesting is how the graph on the below left shows that 'old' tech (blue line), specifically Apple (AAPL.US[5]), Microsoft (MSFT.US[6]) and Intel (INTC.US[7]) smashed 'new' tech (white line), specifically Facebook (FB.US[8]), Amazon (AMZN.US[9]) and Alphabet (GOOG.US[10]), during Q4 2019. Shifting to financials, post 2-3 years of expectations, U.S. bank stocks finally outperformed Canadian bank stocks, as seen from the right side of the 3 year graph on the below right.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-4.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-4.png</url> 2019 was also a year which featured aggressive factor rotation as investor sentiment shifted from fears of recession early in the year to the 'risk on' mentality that began in early August. From that early August start date, the graph on the below left highlights that the relative strength of machinery stocks (blue line) to the S...00, a proxy for cyclical / value stocks, outperformed the relative strength of software stocks (white line) to the S...00, a proxy for growth / momentum, from mid-August into mid-November. Then from November 30th, the white vertical line, both sub-sectors performed in line with the S...0, as according to Goldman Sachs, 'factor correlations were at record levels, ones achieved only twice in the last 30 years'. One perspective on what drove this factor volatility is implied by the graph on the below right. On a monthly basis, each vertical line highlights the percentage frequency one of the three keywords shown at the top of the graph appeared in the media. So while fears of a U.S. recession drove market action early in the year, by mid-year the eyes of investors had shifted to the Fed (which cut rates for the first time in late July), then on to U.S. China trade by October and November.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-5.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-5.png</url> With unprecedented amounts of negative yielding debt (though 'just' $11T currently, down from $17T earlier in 2019), central banks around the world cutting interest rates, and numerous political uncertainties, it's no surprise that gold has performed well despite equities trading at all-time highs. The 3 year graph on the below left compares the price of bullion (blue line) against the gold stock index for the TSX (white line). Each of our funds continues to own shares in gold companies, with our largest single name exposure being Barrick Gold (ABX.CA[11]). As for energy, oil to be more specific, we continue to own Canadian companies and short U.S. names. Our rationale for this positioning was discussed in our May[12] commentary and its thesis remains intact. In short, we believed that the combination of the reality of full cycle economics and Wall Street's diminishing appetite to fund shale operators would cause forward expectations for growth to be trimmed substantially. This story began to play out during the latter months of 2019. In contrast, Canadian oil companies in our portfolios, such as MEG Energy (MEG.CA[13]), Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ.CA[14]) and Whitecap Resources (WCP.CA[15]) are printing cash at this juncture, yet still remain cheap on strip pricing!       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-6.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-6.png</url> The 3 year graph on the above right compares the price of WTI oil (blue line) against the relative strength of the U.S. to Canadian E...ector (white line). We expect the noticeable shift in performance that began in mid-2019 to continue during 2020, thanks to a continuation of the challenges facing the U.S. sector, the gradually improving sentiment towards egress availability for Canadian oil and the shareholder friendly financial statement discipline being exhibited by our investee companies. Shifting to 2020, focusing on quantifiable factors, the two most significant drivers for financial markets will be the state of the U.S. economy and what happens with the rhetoric and actions on global trade. First off we isolate these variables because the U.S. remains the 'best house on a bad street'. China's economy should continue to 'muddle along' but it will not reaccelerate. In fact, as can be seen in the graph on the below left, real GDP growth (white line on left axis) for 2020 is expected to fall below 6% for the first time in almost 30 years. Also, Beijing is cognizant of the country's financial leverage and, aside from a reduction in short term interbank rates, the government has yet to cut interest rates for fear of further stimulating its housing market, a sector in which prices remain high thanks to low inventory even though pricing strength has recently softened. While it's wrong not to positively view the recent cut in the banking system's required reserve ratio, it's important to be aware that: a) corporate defaults are rising and b) industrial sector profitability continues to fall, such that the government needs to act so as to ensure China's banks have the capital flexibility to lend. In other words, it's not about generating faster growth. As for the consumer, recent PMIs hint that employment conditions have stabilized but retail sales, especially on an inflation-adjusted basis continue to slow, especially for durable goods. Last, while food inflation is grabbing all the headlines, thanks to the roughly 170% year over year increase in the price of pork, the preferred source of animal protein, the graph on the below right shows that it's actually falling prices that are the problem for China.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-7.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-7.png</url> Shifting to Europe, growth and inflation trends remain soft and we're far from convinced that we'll see the much discussed and hoped for significant fiscal stimulus in a timely fashion. While Macron's making decent headway at restructuring France, plus the country's less exposed to trade and manufacturing compared to other large EU nations, the outlook for Germany, the EU's largest economy, remains lousy. Meanwhile, Italy will continue to face election and fiscal uncertainty, while the Spanish economy isn't big enough to offset the aggregate drag from other countries. Across the Channel, as long as the potential for a hard Brexit exists it's tough to see upside for either the UK or EU from that situation. As a result, in assessing the policy outlook for Europe, interest rate policy will remain punitive for banks and savers and the Euro (a 58% weight in the 'DXY' index) will only rise if the U.S. economy softens enough to force the Fed to cut rates again. It's widely expected that U.S. growth will fall below a 2% annualized rate during Q1 of 2020. Think of the equation for GDP: consumption + government spending + investment + net trade. During 2019, consumption and government spending were the two growth drivers for the American economy. Entering 2020, after running an estimated US$1T or 4.8% of GDP fiscal deficit for F2019, the rate of change in government spendingwon't make much of a contribution to growth. If one can believe the implied massive increase in U.S. exports that the Chinese are expected to buy as a result of the Phase 1 trade deal, trade should deliver a positive reversal. That leaves consumption and investment as the two sources of uncertainty. Having lapped the tax cuts and boosts to minimum wage, the contribution from consumption is expected to slow, however ongoing wage hikes will ensure that this segment of the U.S. economy continues to help not just the U.S., but the 16% of the global economy that is represented by the U.S. consumer. The big question mark is investments. Housing looks poised to improve further but what about capital spending. Will Boeing (BA.US[16]) begin manufacturing the Max 370 again? In this election year, will trade rhetoric decrease, serving to boost the currently low confidence of CEOs towards spending money. As can be seen from the graph on the below left while spending on tech and R...s approaching 50% of total investment spending, spending on plant ...uipment still constitutes the majority of dollars.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-8.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Forge-First-Asset-Management-8.png</url> If the U.S. consumer hangs in and housing and investment strengthen then the U.S. economy will beat consensus expectations of 1.8% real GDP growth in 2020. Under this scenario, America's rate of relative growth will beat forecasts and ensure that the Fed does not cut rates again this year. This combination would likely prevent the U.S. dollar from experiencing its predicted deep dive. If the U.S. economy is weaker than expected, perhaps because manufacturing weakness spreads to the rest of the economy, the Fed would likely be forced to cut rates again and extend its balance sheet expansion program. Such an outcome would cause the U.S. dollar to experience additional declines. Whichever scenario occurs has profound implications for markets. A rebound in manufacturing activity and easing trade tensions could support the relative performance of technology and industrial stocks. Such an improvement would also be supportive of banks. However, as shown by the 20 year graph on the above right, given the rising burden of costs increasing more than companies have been able to raise pricing (the falling blue line on the right axis), it's likely that profit margins (white line on the left axis) will fall for the second consecutive year during 2020, and a whole host of labour intensive companies could underperform. Of course there is a plethora of non-quantifiable uncertainties facing markets including numerous geopolitical events, U.S. politics, potential for heightened regulatory scrutiny of big tech and the continued rise of populism. Here in Canada, we expect a continuation of the bi-polar nature of the Canadian economy. The largest urban markets, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver will continue to do well, while most other parts of Canada will lag to differing degrees. Toronto, for example, will enjoy the 5th year of its structural renaissance driven by immigration and technology, which in turn supports its real estate markets. Unless we're wrong in thinking that the price for WTI oil will generally remain range bound, between the low $50s to low $60s, wells drilled will fall again in 2020. While stronger U.S. housing should help our forestry sector, much of the benefit will remain with U.S. companies while domestic mining capex is not expected to rebound significantly. Entering 2020 trading at US$0.7713, it's likely the Bank of Canada will finally cut interest rates. Collectively these items suggest that Canadian bank stocks are likely not to outperform the broader market for the second consecutive year. As for the funds at Forge First, our portfolio construction remains 10-15% top down and 85-90% bottoms up stock picking. The macro overlay helps us identify the appropriate gross and net exposure levels for individual sectors and the overall portfolio. This macro work also enables us to identify themes. Recently we have reduced the net exposure for each fund roughly 5%. We're likely to continue to reduce the net exposure of the funds, reverting back towards the lower end of the net exposure range of the portfolios through most of 2019. It's not that we have an overtly bearish outlook, but rather that we believe dispersion could reemerge amongst sectors and the result will be a market that rewards tactical sector exposure and bottom up stock picking. Given our value focus, it pleases us to admit that we can't help but see more compelling long opportunities in value stocks at the moment, a theme that permeates through our portfolios in both the long and short books. By the end of the year oil markets began to feel relatively well balanced and the result was that we actively reduced both oil and gas net exposure throughout December. Based on both management meetings and our analysis of the aggregate (modest) free cash flow coming from the US E...ector we held the view that non-American oil producers in particular had a very constructive setup into both Q4 and 2020 as we expect US capex budgets are poised to contract significantly. However, from our perspective, much of the upside we had considered available in the energy trade seemed to be priced in by New Year's Eve, hence our reduction in exposure into this strength. Subsequent to year end new political risk to supply has been introduced via the escalation of the US-Iran conflict. As a result, we plan to sit tight with our current delta adjusted net exposure to oil-based E...of 10.5% in the Long Short LP and 5.2% in the Multi Strategy LP. Our emphasis continues to be on free cash flow producers. Should we see a sustained pickup in US drilling and completions activity (a logical progression given the strength in crude above $60) then we may be forced to reconsider our continued relatively bullish positioning Our exposure to materials is largely concentrated in mining equities. Our default 5% net weight in gold equities was a solid contributor to 2019 performance and is an exposure we believe will continue to generate positive returns for our investors given: 1) the escalation of conflict(s) in the Middle East, 2) a potentially contentious and polarizing U.S. election, 3) continued central bank easing the world over 4) the potential re-emergence of fiscal stimulus around the world and 5) potentially stagnant equity market returns. Beyond gold[17] we have begun to dip our toe into more cyclical commodities like copper and lumber, albeit only modestly for now. Technology continues to represent a meaningful net exposure for our investors. Beyond core positions in cash cows Microsoft (MSFT.US[18]) and Alphabet (GOOG.US[19]), we have invested in two other verticals in the tech sector, cyber security and what I'll categorize as fintech. With the now ever-present threat of cyber-attacks we're attracted to the growth outlook for Palo Alto (PANW.US[20]) and free cash flow generating capability of Checkpoint Software (CHKP.US[21]). At the behest of the soon-to-be-passed United Nation Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI), Goldman Sachs believes ESG-focused AUM should double to US$45 trillion this year alone. To gain exposure to this enormous yet still nascent secular trend, we own a basket of fintech 'picks n shovel' companies positioned to benefit from the explosion in ESG investing, specifically rating agencies (SPGI.US[22]), index providers (MSCI.US[23]) and ESG risk/factor analytics firms (MSCI.US[24], MORN.US[25]). To wrap up, a year ago we would never have guessed that financial markets would have been as strong as they ended up being during 2019. The obvious question is whether it can happen again. Our answer is it's possible but not likely. We believe the investment road of 2020 will have several detours to navigate and gridlock to surmount, resulting in a volatile year but fertile ground for a team whose funds always include a diversified short book. Thank you for your support and your business during 2019. We look forward to continuing to offer investors an increasingly important sleeve for their portfolios as this financial and business cycle matures.

Our burgeoning dystopia isn't as overtly dystopian as Orwell warned against, and that's the problem. If you haven't read 1984, you really should. I'm not really a fan of the storyline since it's pretty crappy but the message still comes through, and it'll give you an idea of why people reference it so much when talking about governments gone awry. Then, get yourself a copy of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World[3] and you'll start to see the problem. The story's a little better, but not much. The message is more apropos, however. 1984 was about a government that would ban information and rule with a leather boot on your throat, whereas Brave New World was about a system that would slowly seep into our life like a drug. In other words, Orwell warned us about a dystopia that we wouldn't be able to stop, Huxley warned us about a dystopia that we would beg not to stop. The US isn't becoming Orwellian, it's becoming Huxleyan.Social credit systems are coming.In 2013, China started its social credit system[4], coordinated by the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission. What they're planning to do by next year is to have a comprehensive credit system under one roof that will cover pretty much everything in the lives of its citizens. It's already well on its way. In that system, your life is measured based on how well your actions align with the Party's vision of what you should be doing, and how often. It's a little like the credit score your mortgage broker pulls up when you buy a home but instead of deciding if you're allowed to borrow money, this system increasingly decides if you can do anything. Good social credit? You'll be able to travel freely around the country and get into jobs that you want and live in better neighborhoods, and your kids will attend better schools. Bad social credit? You'll be increasingly limited in where you can go and how comfortable your life is until you finally get yourself back in line with everyone else. Sounds like a good plan, right? The 'biggest' problem is that these freedoms that you enjoy will be infringed without due process. The social credit system is a very nebulous and fuzzy system that lacks any sort of transparency. Also, if you happen to speak out against the government or are somehow considered a threat, you could easily find yourself without a job or money and unable to travel - and not only could this be done without any proof that you've done anything illegal - this could happen completely behind the scenes. Because there is no legal proceeding, you have no recourse other than to fall back in line and hope they give you your life back. So what? We don't have social credit here in the US and we wouldn't allow such a thing, right? Wrong. China's system of government allows them to pull from the 1984 rule book but our system is worse. In this case, it isn't directly the government that's the problem, it's Big Tech.The Brave New World of Big TechOur lives are now steeped in social media and corporations that leverage user-created content to make money. Instead of getting our news from trusted news agencies, we now get it from our echo chambers on Facebook[5]. If we do want to explore past that, we get on Google[6] and 'fact-check.' Now part of the problem here is that mass media news stations long ago stopped being news, and threw out their ethics in exchange for advertising revenue. It's big business. However, it gets worse. Both Facebook and Google have been caught censoring information that they deem not to their liking. Now, they're both private companies and we don't HAVE to use them, but they're essentially monopolies that are allowed to exist. By dropping certain viewpoints lower down in the algorithm or even outright blocking them altogether, you now no longer get any sort of balanced view of the world. You start seeing things the way they want you to.Our Growing Social Credit SystemFor quite a while now, we've gotten used to user-created credit systems such as Yelp and Amazon reviews. They're very helpful with deciding what product to buy or service to use. They're also very unreliable and easily faked[7].Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomThis idea of reviews is being expanded to other systems. Uber allows you to review your driver so others can have a better ride experience or avoid someone who's smelly or annoying. Airbnb lets you read about locations and owners to give you a better idea about what the stay will be like. Did you know that you're also being evaluated when you use these services? Uber allows drivers to rate their passengers. If your score drops to a certain point, Uber will ban you[8] from using their system. Airbnb is even worse, stating with regard to banned accounts: This decision is irreversible and will affect any duplicated or future accounts. Please understand that we are not obligated to provide an explanation for the action taken against your account. They can ban you for life, with no explanation, and you have no recourse. So what? Read on. Earlier this year, New York's Department of Financial Services stated in its guidelines that it will allow insurance companies[9] to use non-traditional (which could potentially, and may even already include both social media posts and information from such places as Uber or Airbnb) to determine your risk and cost and the only stipulation is that they can't use it specifically to target protected classes: An insurer should not use an external data source, algorithm or predictive model for underwriting or rating purposes unless the insurer can establish that the data source does not use and is not based in any way on race, color, creed, national origin, status as a victim of domestic violence, past lawful travel, or sexual orientation in any manner, or any other protected class. They added to that in a press release, stating: insurers' use of external data sources has the potential to benefit insurers and consumers alike by simplifying and expediting life insurance sales and underwriting processes. External data sources also have the potential to result in more accurate underwriting and pricing of life insurance.The Coming FutureAs these rating systems continue to be more pervasive, and as companies, agencies, and governments increasingly refer to these scores, they will continue to erode your freedoms and those freedoms could easily be constrained by someone with an agenda, purposely manipulating your score. Because these systems aren't regulated with any sort of effective oversight, they're ripe for misuse and manipulation. No longer will you have protections against punishment for living the life you currently live or speaking out. Our laws that protect you against such invasions do not apply to this new de facto system of government that we're allowing. As we become more accustomed to this increasingly-aggregate score being allowed to affect our lives and our freedoms, we will be more willing to follow whatever guidelines are put in place to achieve higher scores, whether that be buying the right things, saying the right things, or even worse - not saying the wrong things. As we see more value in these systems, we'll not only stop fighting against them affecting our lives, we'll soon beg for them. We may not be living in 1984 but have no doubt, a Brave New World is on the horizon.What do you think?Does Big Tech's invasion into our lives concern you? Do you think there is any way to stop or reduce tech companies' intrusions into our lives?

There are multiple reasons for their slides, but one of the largest forces dragging them down is the growing possibility that countries outside the United States will unleash a new wave of taxes and regulation on the tech superstars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Getting tough on these all-American giants makes a lot of sense from the perspective of a foreign-policy maker. It's a smart way to simultaneously raise tax revenue while addressing genuine problems such as Facebook's easy ways with user data.</p><p>Until now, the FAANGs have always been able to count on Washington's automatic support in international disputes. That may no longer be true.</p><p><person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>in particular, has no reason to love the tech sector, which generally leans Democratic. To the U.S. President's considerable displeasure, the digital economy has spawned billionaires such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be owner of The Washington Post, a constant thorn in Mr. Trump's side. In what may be a not-entirely unrelated phenomenon, the website Axios reported on Wednesday that sources agree the President is \"obsessed\" with Amazon and wants to bring it down.</p><p>To be fair, the leaders of U.S. tech are adding to their own problems with their shambling responses to international concerns. <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>founder and chief executive of Facebook, was late in stepping forward to deal with the furor over the user data obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a British company. He then aggravated the insult this week by declining to appear before British MPs investigating fake news and sending a substitute instead.</p><p>For its part, Googlewas hit with a record  2.4-billion ($3.8-billion) fine last year after the European Union decided the online giant had rigged its search results to favour its own shopping service. This week, The Telegraph newspaper in Britain reported that <person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager, </nameText></person>competition commissioner in the European bloc, remains deeply suspicious of Google's dominance and has not ruled breaking it up.</p><p>One sign of the European Union's growing aggressiveness is its proposal, unveiled this month, for a 3-per-cent tax on the digital revenues of online giants. The levy, which could raise up to  5-billion a year, would be imposed on money generated from digital advertising and subscriber fees, as well as on the cash raised from selling users' personal data to market research firms and others.</p><p>Investors are just beginning to grapple with the potential impact of such moves. The fall in the share prices of the FAANGs, as well as the wider weakness across the technology sector, demonstrates the growing awareness that tech's future may be rockier than its past.</p><p>Higher taxes and more regulation, particularly when it comes to customer data, are by far the most likely outcome of the current conflicts. Far scarier would be an escalating trade war in which each region would move to protect its own tech assets. For now, it's hard to predict what shape official action might take. But the FAANG stocks are, in general, so generously priced that it would require little to knock them down further. With Amazon shares changing hands for more than 300 times earnings, and Netflix stock going for more than 200 times profits, any factor that upsets the sky-high expectations around them is reason for a sell-off.</p><p>The smartest move for investors may be to wait and watch how the tech giants react to the current concerns. To date, the FAANGs have consistently disappointed. Despite huge budgets, they've failed to address genuine concerns over fake news, customer privacy and the disruptive impact of their operations in jurisdictions where they pay little in taxes.</p><p>The real surprise is how little prepared they were for what seems, at least in retrospect, to have been an inevitable backlash. The first step in restoring their appeal to investors would be evidence of a new attitude.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-taxes-and-regulation-are-the-real-risks-for-tech/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-taxes-and-regulation-are-the-real-risks-for-tech/</url> The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20180328ellipsis_A6EUCEOAZBFQRO6KRT3WFQE2UI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S01-KNN1-JCS0-V1S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"777\"/><timeReceived>9:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The iShares Biotech Index Fund (IBB[1]) has risen about 10% over the past month, while the S...00 ETF (SPY[2]) is almost flat and the SPDR Technology ETF (XLK[3]) is down about 3%.One of the main reasons behind this sudden optimism for the industry is the hope for easing of regulations. A draft executive order obtained by the New York Times[4] suggests that the Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices.According to the NYT report, most of the officials responsible for drug policy have strong ties to the industry and the proposals reflected industry influence. This is an excellent news for the industry which has been in the political crosshairs for quite some time. </p><p>(Read: Trump Slump to Oil Slide\u2014Top ETF Stories of First Half 2017[5])Investors also expect a favorable environment for innovation and a streamlined drug approval process. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 21 novel drugs in 2017 compared with an average of 15 from 2011 to 2016 through June each year, per WSJ.The recent rebound in biotech stocks is also a result of attractive valuations after almost two years of underperformance. Further, big pharma companies hold a lot of cash abroad and a repatriation tax holiday promised by Trump would help them bring that cash home to spend on acquisitions among others. Rising M...ctivity could propel these stocks higher.Before the election, investors saw Hillary as a bigger risk to the sector. Her tweet on price gouging in the specialty drug market had sent biotech stocks and ETFs tumbling. In fact, 2016 was the worst year for biotech stocks in more than a decade, with the broad index down more than 20%. (Read: How Tesla is Driving the Lithium ETF Higher[6])The sector had a nice relief rally after the election as Trump's plans to reduce drug regulations and expedite drug approval process boosted the sentiment. However, the rally did not last long as he targeted the drug companies again, with comments like 'they are getting away with murder' and promised a new bidding process that would save billions of dollars.We have highlighted five best performing biotech ETFs of 2017 below:Ark Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (ARKG[7])ARKG focuses on companies involved mainly in molecular diagnostics, bioinformatics, beyond DNA, gene therapy, next generation oncology and targeted therapeutics. (Read: Top and Flop Zones of First Half and Their ETFs)[8]The product is actively managed and charges an annual fee of 75 basis points. It has just about $20 million in AUM.ARKG is up more than 36% this year.Bioshares Biotechnology Clinical Trials (BBC[9]) BBC invests in clinical trials stage biotechnology companies. These are typically younger, smaller companies, which do not have a drug approved, but instead focus on testing their experimental drugs in clinical trials, where chances of success are usually low.The product has a high expense ratio of 85 basis points. It has managed to gather less than $25 million in assets so far.BBC is up more than 34% year-to-date.SPDR S...iotech ETF (XBI[10])XBI, one of the most popular biotech ETFs, follows a modified equal weighted biotech index which provides broad exposure across large, mid and small cap stocks. It charges 35 basis points for expenses and has assets exceeding $3.8 billion.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rated ETF has 99 holdings as of now. It has risen more than 34% this year.First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index Fund (FBT[11])FBT also follows an equal-weighted methodology. It has a more concentrated exposure than other broader biotech ETFs with just 30 holdings focused primarily on recombinant DNA technology, molecular biology, genetic engineering, monoclonal antibody-based technology, lipid/liposome technology, and genomics.The product has an expense ratio of 56 basis points. It is up more than 28% year-to-date.BioShares Biotechnology Products ETF (BBP[12])BBP invests in products stage biotechnology companies. These companies have already successfully completed clinical trials and have received FDA approval to sell and market a drug and are now focused on driving sales.The fund is expensive, with an annual fee of 85 basis points. It has $40 million in AUM. BBP has risen about 23% in 2017.The Bottom-LineInvestors should remember that biotech is a high-growth, high-risk sector and they should be prepared for higher volatility. Particularly the ETFs that invest in unique, specialized sub-segments of the biotech industry or have a lot of exposure to smaller companies, are more volatile than broader market-cap weighted biotech ETFs like IBB.Ultra-cheap, broad healthcare ETFs like SPDR Healthcare ETF (XLV[13]) are more suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance.At the same time, with the aging global population in need for more advanced medicines and rapidly rising healthcare spending in emerging markets, the longer-term outlook for biotech companies remains positive.\u00a0Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

A draft executive order obtained by the New York Times suggests that the Trump administration plans to focus on easing regulatory hurdles rather than lowering drug prices.</p><p>According to the NYT report, most of the officials responsible for drug policy have strong ties to the industry and the proposals reflected industry influence. This is an excellent news for the industry which has been in the political crosshairs for quite some time. (Read: Trump Slump to Oil SlideTop ETF Stories of First Half 2017)</p><p>Investors also expect a favorable environment for innovation and a streamlined drug approval process. The Food and Drug Administration has approved 21 novel drugs in 2017 compared with an average of 15 from 2011 to 2016 through June each year, per WSJ.</p><p>The recent rebound in biotech stocks is also a result of attractive valuations after almost two years of underperformance. Further, big pharma companies hold a lot of cash abroad and a repatriation tax holiday promised by Trump would help them bring that cash home to spend on acquisitions among others. Rising M&amp;A activity could propel these stocks higher.</p><p>Before the election, investors saw Hillary as a bigger risk to the sector. Her tweet on price gouging in the specialty drug market had sent biotech stocks and ETFs tumbling. In fact, 2016 was the worst year for biotech stocks in more than a decade, with the broad index down more than 20%. 2017 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLDTPT-95060585</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLDTPT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NXF-5C31-JDJN-62C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411387</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"311\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Global Data Point.

Marine Le Pen may have stuttered but still picked up almost 11 million votes. Her opponent, the \"normal\" candidate, was leader of a party only one year old. The ongoing terror attacks, fake news panic, Trump's tweets and James Comey: last year never really ended, it just carried straight on into this one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After decades of exaggerated prediction, the internet is finally transforming politics, but not in the way the digital prophets expected. The 90s, you may recall, were awash with optimism about our online future: limitless information and total connection would make us more informed, less bigoted and kinder citizens. But the internet is an overwhelming mess of competing facts, claims, blogs, data, propaganda, misinformation, investigative journalism, charts, different charts, commentary and reportage. It's not the slow and careful politicians who have thrived in this busy environment, it's the people with the shareable cut-through messages. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>might very well be the first truly social-media politician: his emotion-filled, simplistic blasts are perfect for\u00a0the\u00a0medium.</p><p>As a result, society is currently gripped by a curious consensus: that the internet has conspired with rightwing populists to sew up the future of politics. Noting the emergence of populist strongmen and demagogues, who seem to be digital wizards like recovering Twitter addict Trump, and violent opponents who seem only to bolster their support, many are comparing - with a certain grim fascination - our current turbulence with the 1930s. That is a very short-term view of things. The supremacy of the populist right is not the inevitable future. The rise of the right is better seen as an early skirmish in a much longer, and far more significant, technology-led restructuring of our politics and society. Digital technology has helped the populist right for now, but it will soon swallow them up, along with many other political movements unable or unwilling to see how the world is changing.</p><p>Consider for a moment how your life has changed thanks to digital technology. You can become friends with 2\u00a0billion connected people, chose your own news, and watch/date/order whatever you want, on demand. Infinite choice and control is now the norm, and yet formal politics has barely evolved since the days of Robert Peel. Our modern political system came of age in the industrial revolution, which was a time of massive organisations and centralised control. We are now, however, firmly in a new industrial revolution, characterised by endless choice, digital technology, data, automation and artificial intelligence. The economy, identity, political allegiances, perhaps even the essence of what it is to be human, are all starting to change, and our politics will have to change with it. The current set-up, including the populist right, will cling on for a while, like a legacy IT system that's too pricey to update, but it will shortly become redundant.</p><p>Crypto-anarchy is taking over the world - millions now unwittingly rely on it for online security</p><p>So what else might follow?</p><p>In October last year, while researching my new book, Radicals,  I was invited by a Slovenian hacker in his late 20s called Pavol to a place called Parallel Polis, a three-storey building in Prague that includes a 3D printer workshop and the \" Institute of Crypto-Anarchy\". Crypto-anarchists are mostly computer-hacking, anti-state libertarians who have been kicking around the political fringes for two decades, trying to warn a mostly uninterested public about the dangers of a world where everything is connected and online. They also believe that digital technology, provided citizens are able to use encryption themselves, is the route to a stateless paradise, since it undermines government's ability to monitor, control and tax its people. Crypto-anarchists build software - think of it as political computer code - that can protect us online. Julian Assange is a crypto-anarchist (before WikiLeaks he was an active member of the movement's most important mailing list), and so perhaps is Edward Snowden. Once the obsessive and nerdy kids in school, they are now the ones who fix your ransomware blunder or start up unicorn tech firms. They are the sort of people who run the technology that runs the world.</p><p>Parallel Polis was putting on something called the Hackers Congress; a three-day gathering for Europe's collection of crypto-anarchists, bitcoin enthusiasts, libertarians and hackers. The theme was Decentralised. \"The concept of authoritative state is gradually becoming obsolete,\" read the programme. \"The rise of sharing economies with reputation models, digital contracts and cryptocurrencies makes the role of central governments useless.\" The congress was designed to work out how to speed up its demise.</p><p>When I arrived early on Saturday morning, the whole place was teeming with (mostly) men in their 20s or early 30s speaking in competent Atlantic English. The 3D printer whirred in the background, postcards of the elusive creator of bitcoin,Satoshi Nakamoto, were being sold, and eyes stared at lines of the incomprehensible language of computers: java, ruby, C++. At events and clusters, groups of these future-dwellers complained about inefficiency as if it were a cardinal sin; discussed \"how to build a stateless world\"; praised Edward Snowden; laughed about crap government IT; weighed up the latest anonymous and secure messaging apps; and talked excitedly about bitcoin and something called \" blockchain \". Frank and Smuggler - two German crypto-anarchists - wore facemasks all weekend, because they were worried about facial recognition\u00a0technology.</p><p>I hadn't eaten since I left London, so the first thing I did on arrival was join the queue for food and coffee. But my Czech currency, koruna, which I had dutifully exchanged at the airport at near criminal rates, was not accepted. \"We only take bitcoin,\" said the assistant. Parallel Polis is the one place in the world that accepts only bitcoin. In case you don't know yet, bitcoin is a digital currency. It is secure, pseudonymous, and fast, with no central authority controlling value or supply. It's a currency that operates independently of the government, and can't easily be traced back to individuals or taxed. At Polis the staff are paid in bitcoin; rent collected for their co-working space is paid in bitcoin, too. I got a little plastic card with a QR code, and transferred bitcoin on to it using one of the three specialised ATM machines. From that point on, every time I wanted anything I scanned the QR code. Ping! A coffee. Ping! A Red Bull. Ping! Some goulash. Ping! A postcard of Edward Snowden. I didn't use koruna once.</p><p>Given a bitcoin was worth around \u00a3300 back then, and is now trading at close to \u00a32,000, my cup of coffee cost approximately \u00a325 in today's money. Some of the staff have probably now retired. A few years ago crypto-anarchists like these were the only people using bitcoin. Even though it's now used by millions of people, and accepted at a growing number of businesses as a legitimate form of money, it was originally designed by a crypto-anarchist as a neat way of undermining central bank's control over the money supply. It is a revolutionary idea wrapped up as efficiency gain. Bitcoin is more than a currency, it's a new way of handling information. It uses blockchain, which is a technique to create a massive, distributed, tamper-proof database that anyone can add to but no one can delete, because no one controls it. Millions of pounds of investment are pouring into bitcoin and blockchain from governments, banks, IT and financial services, all excitedly eyeing up a novel way to store information or prove asset ownership securely. Specialists reckon it's as revolutionary as the internet itself.</p><p>Crypto-anarchy is taking over the world, since millions now unwittingly rely on it for online security, and more are scrambling after blockchain and bitcoin ideas, desperate not to be left behind. At Parallel Polis the idea of wholesale adoption of crypto-anarchism by society is met with shrugged shoulders and obviously-they-have smirks. That governments, businesses and friendly liberal types are falling over themselves to import exciting new tech that has been explicitly designed to undermine them is a bit of an inside joke. Most of us chase their latest shiny toys and have no real understanding of what we're doing.</p><p>The rise of crypto-anarchism might be good news for individual users - and there are plenty working on ways of using this technology for decent social purposes - but it's also bad news for governments. It's not a direct path, but digital technology tends to empower the individual at the expense of the state. Police forces complain they can't keep up with new forms of online crime, partly because of the spread of freely available encryption tools. Information of all types - secrets, copyright, creative content, illegal images - is becoming increasingly difficult to contain and control. The rash of ransomware is certainly going to get worse, exposing the fragility of our always connected systems. (It's easily available to buy on the dark net, a network of hidden websites that are difficult to censor and accessed with an anonymous web browser.) Who knows where this might end. A representative from something called \" Bitnation \" explained to Parallel Polis how an entire nation could one day be provided online via an uncontrollable, uncensorable digital network, where groups of citizens could club together to privately commission public services. Bitnation's founder, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, hopes Bitnation could one day replace the nation state and rid us of bureaucrats, creating \"a world of a million competing digital nations\", as she later told me.</p><p>Digital technology, like bitcoin, is a disruptive force of decentralisation, tearing down settled hierarchies</p><p>And that is just the tip of the iceberg. As the theme of the congress suggests, digital technology, like bitcoin, is a disruptive force of decentralisation. It tears down settled hierarchical organisations and builds new networked ones (although, like Facebook, they can sometimes end up becoming very centralised too). Social media is \"many to many\" communication, rather than \"one to many\" broadcast. \"Sharing economy\" companies such as Uber  and Airbnb are all about linking people and assets via smartphones. Even the internet itself is designed to be distributed, borderless and difficult to control.</p><p>That decentralising force is sweeping through society and economies and the affects are difficult to predict. The most fun to be had at Parallel Polis was guessing which industries would be \"Ubered\" next - that is, transformed into a peer-to-peer industry conducted on an app. Several companies are already monetising unused assets: borrowing cars ( RelayRides ), daily tasks ( TaskRabbit ), lending bikes ( Liquid ), lending money ( Lending Club ), home wifi ( Fon ) and even clothes ( Neighborgoods ). The conclusion at Parallel Polis - and indeed in Silicon Valley - is that any industry that takes a cut of a deal between two people or holds fixed assets that can be provided informally will be soon \"Ubered\", because smartphones link buyers and sellers directly. Personally, I think estate agents might be next.</p><p>These so-called sharing economy companies proudly disrupt entire industries in the name of efficiency. Politics is struggling to keep up, and regulators aren't always sure what rules apply to them. Uber, the largest taxi firm in the world without owning any taxis, runs gig-economy comprising temporary, zero-hour employees. It works well for consumers and some drivers, but the cost of flexibility is job security and legal rights - in addition to squeezing existing industries such as London's black cabs. The Treasury reckons this gig economy could one day cost it a small fortune in tax.</p><p>Spending time in Parallel Polis is like peering into the not too distant future and seeing the approaching disruption. Shortly after I emerged from the Tardis I watched <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>get elected with tweets about borders and coal mines and reopened factories. He tapped into legitimate worries that many felt and feel, and correctly fingered the stagnating wages of middle America (in part a result of technological changes). But it all felt somehow marginal, a sticking plaster for what's coming. Most people at Parallel Polis thought the US election was a bit of an irrelevance.</p><p>Even in the short time since Trump's victory, an even bigger technology challenge has loomed into view: artificial intelligence. Forget angry marching robots or some absurd \"singularity\", whereby computers become sentient. The AI revolution is taking the boring form of machine-learning algorithms, which essentially means giving a machine lots of examples from which it learns what to do. Give it enough data and it can start doing things better, and faster, than humans. And because machine learning relies on data to improve, there is a powerful feedback loop: more data fed in makes it smarter, which allows it to get more data, which makes it smarter, which...</p><p>In the past couple of years we've entered this self-perpetuating loop. Brace yourself for a run of stories about machines doing jobs better than unreliable, break-taking, tardy Homo sapiens. Already this year software has trounced humans at fruit-picking, bricklaying and burger-flipping. That you're probably not surprised by this remarkable feat shows how far we've come. It will very shortly move on to less routine and even very skilled work that takes years for a human to master. Already machine-learning software can outperform the top doctors at diagnosing illness from CT scans, by running through millions of correct and thousands of incorrect examples real live doctors have produced over the years.</p><p>Whether this machine-learning revolution means fewer jobs, more jobs, worse jobs or different jobs is hard to predict. More jobs in the short term and fewer in the long term seems most likely: according to the Bank of England, as many as 15 million British jobs might disappear from the twin forces of AI and automation within a generation. At the very least it will mean disruption for people and some entire industries, twinned with sudden shifts in labour and skills needs. Take trucking in the US, which is the biggest employer in 10 states, responsible for 3.5\u00a0million jobs. It may be a mostly job-free industry within a decade. Things will still be shifted around in containers of course, but it'll all be run by yet another software firm that rents human-free cabs. And with that, there will be no need for truck stops either, or the highway patrol, or the companies that make parts for radar guns, and so on and on.</p><p>If large numbers of the tax-paying classes disappear, or are reduced to precarious freelances, what happens? The techno-optimist - the one that bounced around the Parallel Polis echo-chamber - says we'll create new jobs, free people from the drudgery of dull work and all arc toward progress and freedom. The stock solution will doubtless be for the hapless to retrain for better, more creative, more meaningful jobs, putting aside the dubious evidence for whether that actually works - retrain for what exactly? The best we appear capable of at the moment is software programming and coding. But coding will probably be one of the first jobs to be automated out of existence, leaving the newly trained feeling like Minidisc specialists circa 2005: the exciting new future washed away before it could settle in.</p><p>No one in Prague or Silicon Valley or Shoreditch or anywhere else is willing or able to put the brakes on, which is why Parallel Polis people were excitedly discussing the \"universal basic income\", essentially a way to pay economically useless people to live, consume and keep capitalism ticking over. Perhaps that will work - it is seriously worth debating - and perhaps new jobs will arrive too. But also possible is a dystopia in which millions of economically valueless citizens scratch out an existence as a client class while a small number of tech mega-monopolies and crypto-anarchist geniuses rack up unprecedented wealth and influence. No one really knows where this ends\u00a0up.</p><p>At present, technology stands outside the messy business of politics, but in a couple of elections' time, AI, big tech, the sharing economy, will be discussed as angrily as immigration or the NHS now. Does anyone seriously believe that Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May or Tim Farron or Nicola Sturgeon have the foggiest clue about any of this, and what to do about it? (I've not even mentioned climate change, synthetic biology, the continued mass movement of people, billions of connected internet-enabled devices.) To most politicians - even the left, which once imagined that its \"white heat\" would forge a better world - technology is mainly viewed as a job creator or deliverer of efficiency. The phrase \"centre of innovation\" is the digital equivalent of motherhood and apple-pie: no right-minded politician could ever oppose it. True, things are slowly changing and there's more about digital technology in this round of manifestos than ever before: the Conservatives promise a digital charter, the Lib Dems mention artificial intelligence, and Jeremy Corbyn launched a special \"digital manifesto\" last year. Maybe I'm expecting too much, and maybe citizens don't care enough either. But none of this yet amounts to a vision that matches the scale of what's going\u00a0on.</p><p>And what of the populist right - with their focus on culture, borders, immigration, and sticking it to the establishment? When asked about the future of artificial intelligence and automation, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin replied: \"It's not even on our radar screen\" and that he's \"not worried at all\". A few weeks ago his boss climbed into a huge rig wearing an \"I love trucks\" badge, just as nearly everyone in Silicon Valley agreed that artificial intelligence was about to decimate the industry. Trump might be able to stop the immigrants or slow outsourcing for a while, but who will stop the robots and the smiling data scientist? The little Trumps - Le Pen, Farage, Wilders etc- aren't much better. Their concern with burqas and bankers means technology, the real driving force in society today, isn't in their sights. The one MP that actually understood bitcoin, Douglas Carswell, recently\u00a0resigned.</p><p>The politics of rightwing populism won't go without a colossal struggle of course, because it is, in part at least, a reaction to changes digital technology has already wrought. In the short term it might even strengthen: if the walls don't keep people out, promises aren't kept, wages stagnate, jobs don't reappear, taxes don't get raised, then disappointment fuels disillusion and we enter a spiral of ever-deepening radicalism. But the collapse of the centre ground of politics, into which noisy populists have barged, is also creating room for others: the French leftist politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon (and his deliciously pointless 100% income tax rate on top earners), Bernie Sanders, Podemos, Occupy, the Women's Equality party. In Italy, comedian Beppe Grillo's internet-based Five Star Movement defies placement on the left-right political spectrum, and is currently leading in Italian polls.</p><p>Things are opening up in politics. So perhaps a better comparison than the 1930s for our age is the 1820s. That period witnessed what must have felt at the time like unprecedented change and confusion: the onset of industrialisation, political revolution and counter-revolution, great leaps in science, and the first railways. A British prime minister was assassinated. Luddites smashed machines, fearing that the power loom - that generation's artificial intelligence - would cause mass unemployment. But the turmoil and instability of the last industrial revolution did not thrust us inexorably into the arms of tyrants. It did however shake up old assumptions as never before, stimulating a flowering of ideas, some of which were stirrings of the modern world: working-class consciousness, extended (albeit still limited) suffrage, Factory Acts, socialist theory, Catholic emancipation and utilitarianism.</p><p>At some point, and probably sooner than we think, the current left and right offerings of the major parties, including (perhaps especially) the populist, will start to appear ludicrous and unworkable. New political movements and ideas will arrive before long for this industrial revolution, especially once the majority of the population will soon have grown up online. It will be a politics that offers solutions to the challenges society will face, and be bold enough to steer technology rather than be led by it, to harness it rather than dismiss it, to see it as a motor of social change, not just a job maker. Perhaps there will be some back-to-the-earth, off-grid thinking reminiscent of the 1970s. (There are already small hints of it if you look in the right places: bricks through Google bus windows and digital detox days ). I'm not sure. More likely is that groups like the Prague crypto-anarchists, who will embrace the changes and experiment with entirely new forms of governance and society, will emerge. After all, they were right about digital technology, about surveillance and bitcoin and most of us ignored them.

FACEBOOK'S OWN STAFF HELPED WIN THE ELECTION.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>States News Service</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline><nitf:dateline><location>CHAPEL HILL, N.C.</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following information was released by the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's role during the 2016 presidential election has come under extraordinary scrutiny in recent weeks. Most notably, attention has swirled around a Kremlin-backed troll farm's purchase of $100,000 worth of ads on the platform during the election cycle. This came on the heels of controversies over the proliferation of \"fake news\" during the campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But our research shows another, less discussed aspect of Facebook's political influence was far more consequential in terms of the election outcome. The entirely routine use of Facebook by Trump's campaign and others a major part of the $1.1 billion of paid digital advertising during the cycle is likely to have had far greater reach than Russian bots and fake news sites. And beyond this reach, our research reveals that firms such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter now play a much more active role in electoral politics than has been widely acknowledged.</p><p>Those companies had staff working hand in hand with Trump campaign digital staffers, according to Gary Coby, the director of advertising at the RNC and director of digital advertising and fundraising for Trump's general election campaign. \"I required that if people wanted to work with us, they needed to send bodies to us in Texas and put people on the ground because Hillary had this giant machine, well-built out with digital operations, and we're just a few guys and a big Twitter account,\" he told us.</p><p>\"Google, Twitter, and Facebook, we had people who were down there constantly and constantly working with us, helping us solve our problems in relation to how we're using the platforms,\" he said. \"If we're coming up with new ideas, bringing them into the fold to come up with ideas of how their platform could help us achieve our goals.\"</p><p>In light of Mark Zuckerberg's recent announcement that Facebook will require disclosure and transparency around who creates and purchases political ads, it is worth considering the transparency of the behind-the-scenes work that enables the use of Facebook, Google, and Twitter to influence voters.</p><p>During and since the election, we formally interviewed dozens of staffers working on all the major 2016 campaigns, along with representatives of the big tech companies, to understand how campaigns use these platforms to reach the electorate. All of them echoed Coby's comments that Google, Facebook, and Twitter play active roles in electoral politics.</p><p>For example, these firms offer an extensive array of campaign services including advising campaigns on everything from the content of ads and other communications to the specific groups they might benefit most from targeting, and how best to reach them. Consider the fact that all three of these firms have dedicated partisan teams that work with campaigns. Staffers work with campaigns to guide advertising buys, boost engagement around online ads, and shepherd the use of their platforms.</p><p>One reason these firms have invested in working with campaigns is for a slice of the political ad sales market. The 2016 election alone was a $2 billion enterprise.</p><p>Technology firms and campaigns are both incentivized to work together digital ads deliver revenue for technology companies based on engagement. This means that these firms get paid more based on higher performing ads: More click-throughs equal more revenue. For campaigns, more clicks mean greater reach and potential impact.</p><p>It's not just the ad revenue alone that these firms are after. Presidential campaigns garner massive, worldwide attention. As such they serve as important vehicles for marketing these platforms and new tools they offer. Even more, we found that technology firms want to create relationships with campaigns to further their long-term lobbying efforts. Successful candidates become legislators, governors, and even presidents, with influence over the regulations, or lack thereof, that will apply to these firms.</p><p>Not all campaigns use Facebook, Twitter, and Google in the same way. Hillary Clinton built a large in-house staff to execute digital media on the campaign, but with a lean staff, the Trump team likely benefited more from the help provided by the tech companies. The expertise these firms provided to the campaign's general-election San Antonio office was particularly important, and days after the election, Trump's digital director said Facebook played a \"critical role\" in its success.</p><p>You could consider the help provided by tech companies as a form of subsidy to the campaigns. These subsidies of expertise are mutually beneficial: The platforms get ad revenues and build relationships with campaigns and their candidates, while campaigns optimize their advertising and extend the reach of their messaging.</p><p>Ali-Jae Henke, the current head of industry, elections at Google, described the company's routine work with campaigns during the cycle: \"They say 'like look, we really want to get attention and we want to reach as many people as possible and these are kind of the areas politically where we might have challenges or the different types of voting blocs we need to reach' ... and so then I am able to in that advisory capacity be like, 'well this is what moms look like online, this is how we find them...'\"</p><p>This work is of major importance, because even the most well-funded political campaigns are always strapped for time and resources, given the monumental task they have of contacting, motivating, and persuading the electorate. By enhancing the ability of institutional political actors to connect with citizens and make politics meaningful in an era of fragmented audiences and attention, we believe Google, Facebook, and Twitter are playing a significant role in the democratic process.</p><p>There is a troubling lack of transparency that clouds this role. Given the scope and scale of the paid uses of platforms such as Facebook by campaigns, the effects likely dwarf those of fake news or illegitimate advertising buys. This, of course, is speculation, because we will never know for certain how much impact these things had. That is why the basic lack of transparency and disclosure surrounding digital political advertising is so concerning, and Mark Zuckerberg's recent announcement was a step in the right direction.</p><p>Google and Twitter should join Facebook in its effort around transparency and disclosure, and make the paid content posted on their platforms public so citizens, journalists, and academics can evaluate these messages. Government regulation around transparency is ideal. However, former chairperson Ann Ravel stated that the Federal Election Commission is \"dysfunctional\" and \"deadlocked.\" In the interim, these firms should work together to set standards for political advertising disclosure and open paid communications up to public scrutiny.</p><p>Daniel Kreiss is Associate Professor in the School of Media and Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His research explores the impact of technological change on the public sphere and political practice.</p><p>Shannon McGregor is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at The University of Utah. Her research interests center on political communication, social media, gender, and public opinion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121648194</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PNY-R6W1-DYTH-G34X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1214\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 3, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Amazon, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Facebook</url>, Google et al - are the mightiest beasts in global business.</p><p>After years of hoovering up colossal amounts of personal data, feasting on barely contested M&amp;A deals of rivals and bolstering their dominant market position in a dizzying assortment of businesses, they are now the biggest and wealthiest corporations on earth, wielding vast power and financial muscle.</p><p>More important, they have no desire to be cut down to size or to acquiesce to the erection of anything more the flimsiest of regulatory guard rails.</p><p>Former Google chairman <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Eric Schmidt</url> summed up Silicon Valley's attitude - and its likely litigious response - in an interview with the Telegraph last month when he said he saw \"no basis in law\" for a break-up of any kind.</p><p>Facebook's top lobbyist Nick Clegg struck a similar tone recently.</p><p>\"You don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company,\" he purred.</p><p>Either way, with extraordinarily deep pockets and access to the finest and most handsomely paid lawyers and lobbyists on the planet, this is a tussle that could run and run.</p><p>If they are serious, then US lawmakers, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission - which are limbering up now too - should be ready for a protracted and brutal contest.</p><p>Perhaps inevitably, comparisons have been drawn with the antitrust offensive against the Standard Oil empire of John D Rockefeller.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">US Justice Department heaps pressure on tech giants over competition concerns</url></p><p>But that took 21 years - starting in 1890 and culminating in 1911 - and it was arguably rather less complex.</p><p>Although Standard Oil encompassed an astonishing variety of businesses - from oil production to pipelines, railways, refineries and distribution companies - this was a business assembled by a single man in a single industry - and efforts to dismember it were largely restricted to its operations in one country: the US.</p><p>For regulators, Big Tech is a far more unwieldy and diverse target, composed of a variety of truly global companies whose alleged ills are far more extensive.</p><p>This is not just a fight about predatory pricing or monopolistic behaviour by powerful companies over a single industry.</p><p>Google and Facebook exercise a vice-like grip over the global online ad market, of course.</p><p>But they are also accused of spreading misinformation, abusing the privacy of customers and of amplifying the views of extreme right-wing or terror groups.</p><p>These are all different concerns to some of those about Amazon and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Apple</url>, for example - neither of which can really be described as a monopoly.</p><p>Amazon may be a huge company but it still only controls a 5pc share of the US retail market.</p><p>That is why regulators need to rapidly decide what they intend to focus on and what their priorities should be.</p><p>At the moment, the approach seems muddled, giving the impression of a thoughtless all-out assault on an industry that has brought many benefits to consumers as well as potential harm.</p><p>So far, however, US lawmakers have shown little sign of being up to the challenge.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/06/04/breaking-tech-giants-america-finally-ready-take-action-against/\">Technology intelligence - newsletter promo - EOA</url></p><p>When Mark Zuckerberg explained patiently to a hearing last year that \"Senator, we run ads\", he offered a revealing glimpse of Silicon Valley's real view of Washington DC.</p><p>The subtext was clear: \"These ageing dopes really have no idea how our industry works.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the sense that Silicon Valley's biggest players are under siege - not just in Europe where EC Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has been levying big fines but now in the US too - is growing.</p><p>The US tech giants have traditionally shunned political lobbying - at least compared to other industries like pharmaceuticals or energy - but the industry is now tooling up for a fight.</p><p>Google, Amazon, and Facebook forked out record amounts to influence the US government in 2018.</p><p>They spent a combined $48 million on lobbying last year - up 13 percent from 2017.</p><p>The largest increase came from google, which lifted its lobbying spending 18pc to over $21m. Facebook's spending rose 10pc to over $12m.</p><p>With the threat of US antitrust action looming, you can bet those figures are destined to shoot up again sharply in 2019, not least because the tech industry is now feeling the heat from all sides of the political spectrum.</p><p>Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren, the longstanding antitrust campaigner who is now running for the nomination for president is agitating for a breakup of Big Tech.</p><p>But Donald Trump also has the industry in his sights, driven by an intense dislike of Silicon Valley's arch-liberal values and claims that conservative views are suppressed on social media.</p><p>With political pressure building, fireworks can be expected. Just don't expect a resolution any time soon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-53432495</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8P-4RW1-JCJY-G3MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"904\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

I was even part of not one, but two of such waves of disruption and think I've got some pretty unique insights into the process. Unfortunately, during the past decade Silicon Valley has bastardized the word \"disruption\" with accelerated frequency and velocity to a point where it has actually lost its value and meaning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hollywood actually wrote the book on over-exposure. A decade ago every other word was \"brilliant\" (he/she/it was always preceded with this adjective) but they have now discovered a new one - \"amazing!\" Just watch how many times anyone associated with Hollywood uses it in a single sentence. What is \"amazing\" is the fact they all think they are being original and creative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street is not too far behind, but I never thought I would say that about Silicon Valley. After all, the core of the valley's mindset is logic and not hype-based. Apparently, things have changed. Case in point: Uber.</p><p>Too much of the media's coverage follows the line of this piece from last month on The Street.com: \" <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/1yZA9rx\">How Uber Is Changing the U.S. Economy Like No One Ever Imagined</url> \" Huh? The U.S. economy?!? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Really</emphasis>????The article quoted auto analysts from Morgan Stanley who, during a recent trip to Detroit, raved about their Uber experience stating:</p><p> \" <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The highlight of our trip, however, was the 3 Uber trips we took between meetings,\" analyst Adam Jonas and his team wrote in the note. The phenomenon of</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">shared mobility</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">has profound implications that extend far beyond the auto industry.\"</emphasis></p><p>As if that wasn't comical enough, the article went on to quote a recent presentation by Ford noting that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"alternative mobility/car sharing/ride sharing is the single most disruptive trend to the automotive business model.\"</emphasis> Using the words disruption and Uber in the same sentence with Detroit should be a sin. We are talking about Motor City here, one of the Original Disruptors!</p><p>The only real threat to the auto industry comes directly from within. It's called ignorance. Or, maybe it's better stated as arrogance, which equates to the same thing. The auto industry has a continued lack of understanding that we need cars built with quality and economics in mind and not cars that are going to be recalled the minute we drive them off the dealership lot.</p><p>But let's dissect things first, shall we? Shared mobility is one of those phrases that is supposed mean something, but in actuality means absolutely nothing. Like \"world class\", \"high impact\", \"best practices\" \"thought leadership\", etc. They're full of superficial gibberish only used by people that are either superficial, are super-hyping or both.</p><p>To put things in their proper perspective, let's identify what Uber actually is - a dispatch service first and foremost. Think Louie DePalma (of TV's Taxi fame) with a mobile. That's it.</p><p>Someone please explain to me how that will change the U.S. economy, built on hard physical assets of which Uber has none. Zero, zilch, nada, nula. That may not necessarily be a bad thing, but given that Uber's most recent funding of $1.2 billion apparently values the company at $40 billion is beyond absurd. That is higher than Delta Air Lines, with all of those planes and hangers and airport terminals and employees and, and, and... You get the picture.</p><p>What Uber does has been done for over a millennium, which is transporting people from local point A to local point B. Horse buggies did that, trains and subways do that, buses do it, taxis do it, limos do it and have been doing it way before Uber's founders and execs were even born. The only difference is the service is summoned via a mobile app. So how is that different than having Yellow Cab, my friend Manny's VIP Cab or countless other transport providers on speed dial? Shared mobility? Get the #$!*outta here Wolf Street boy.</p><p>Furthermore, Uber creates NOTHNG. It is not a market creation entity (e.g. microprocessors). It is not a market-expansion business (e.g.: routers). It is not disruptive (e.g.: mobile phones). It is only an alternative solution in an established industry with well-heeled players. In a word - competitive - and that is it! It may take dollars away from cabbies, limos, subways, etc., but does not create new dollars that justifies its rumored valuation. PCs created new dollars; mobile phones created new dollars; Ford's Model T created new dollars. That's disruption.</p><p>And since I am not a Wall Street analyst I will not delve into Uber's countless issues that are structural in nature such as liabilities, regulatory concerns, business practices and, most of all, its business model - none of which can be resolved by simply upgrading its privacy policy. I have yet to meet an Uber fan among its legions of drivers. You can't have a sustainable business if the rank and file hate your guts, just ask the airlines. I'm not implying that Uber is not a good alternative. Competition benefits consumers and I am one of them, but to call Uber 'disruptive' to the auto industry, not to mention the U.S. economy, is beyond ludicrous.</p><p>My net-net is this: after a long dry spell in the IPO market, Wall Street has gotten spoiled with recent giga deals (Facebook, Twitter, Alibaba, etc) and like hungry wolves they are salivating for the next big kill. Uber's PR machinery is a willing participant by over-hyping its value proposition, which is a very dangerous game.</p><p>As previously stated, I have witnessed many promising disruptors that are no longer around. Remember when Pets.com was going to disrupt the multi-billion dollar pet industry? In the aftermath, the only thing left standing was its famous mascot - a sock puppet. Technically speaking, that does qualify as a hard asset. Some of the most influential Silicon Valley VCs are concerned about a new big tech bubble but they are conspicuously absent from publically questioning Uber's overstated future, as is the media.</p><p>Isn't anyone thinking out there? Apparently not, which to me is, well, pretty amazing!</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://upstart.bizjournals.com/resources/executive-forum/2013/12/18/funding-tips-from-startup-raiser.html\">Read more from Bill Baker: How to master the art of startup funding</url></p><p>The views expressed here are the author's and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of Upstart Business Journal.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

In March 2019, mass shootings at two New Zealand mosques saw over 50 people die at the hands of a lone white supremacist. This was followed closely by a series of bombings in churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday with more than 250 dead. A week later, on 28 April 2019, a gunman opened fire in a synagogue in California killing one (earlier in October last year, 11 worshippers died in a mass shooting in a synagogue in Pittsburgh).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the aftermath of such violence, the very best of humanity was on display, manifested in the outpouring of assistance and compassion for those who were injured and for the loved ones of those killed. There was universal condemnation of the attacks and the racial and religious hatred that spawned them. These events also caused disquiet around the world on what appears to be emerging trends within countries.</p><p>Attitudes towards Racial, Religious, and Cultural Differences</p><p>Countering the white supremacist far-right and Islamist extremists must be a major priority of all governments. Politicians from the left and right of the political spectrum play an important role in promoting peace and harmony between different social and ethnic groups.</p><p>Unfortunately, some have acted indifferently, even irresponsibly, towards the increasingly apparent racial, religious, and cultural divisions within their borders. Instead of attempting to bridge such divides, these politicians deepen the chasms with divisive rhetoric and hate speech.</p><p>In Europe and elsewhere, some politicians have increasingly given voice to extremist rhetoric in their quest for votes and popular support. Such tactics are cause for alarm, especially since studies have shown that leaders have a direct impact on setting the political tone for the country (and sometimes the world) and implementing policies on race and religion.</p><p>Some countries have taken an exclusive approach towards the minority groups within their territories, instead of being inclusive and culturally sensitive to them. As a result, some who feel marginalised and discriminated leave the country to support extremist causes.</p><p>Many governments also struggle with the proliferation of hate speech on the Internet on platforms such as Facebook.</p><p>Bridging Racial and Cultural Divides</p><p>What can governments do to create a more harmonious coexistence in our increasingly heterogeneous societies? Harmonious coexistence may have been a given in societies that for generations were largely homogeneous, whether for reasons of ethnicity, such as in the countries of East Asia or Scandinavia, or for reasons of beliefs, such as in the United States or Europe.</p><p>But homogeneity may be a thing of the past.</p><p>In today's globalised setting, homogeneity is progressively giving way to plurality as a result of increased people-to-people exchanges, immigration, and digital technology. The resultant greater diversity of peoples, beliefs, and opinions can easily become a crucible for racial, religious, and cultural tensions and divisions, if not managed carefully.</p><p>As such, harmonious coexistence is no longer a luxury but a necessity, and one that must be consistently embraced by the highest levels of government and across every sector of the population. If we want a garden to be filled with healthy plants, we have to tend it with deliberate love and care.</p><p>Singapore's Potential Role as Bridge Builder</p><p>Singapore is an interesting case study for the fostering of harmonious coexistence - one of the fundamental guiding principles of the country's governance is respect for pluralism and diversity of race, religion and culture. This cardinal principle has been followed through in law, policy and practice since the country's independence.</p><p>The government has secured common spaces for all religious and non-religious groups to coexist and flourish. To protect the sanctity of this negotiated space, special laws have been enacted against hate and attempts to incite enmity and ill-will between different racial and religious groups. This is extended to the online world.</p><p>Singapore's multi-cultural efforts have been recognised. In March 2019, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, a US-based inter-faith group announced that Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will receive the 2019 World Statesman Award for 'fostering a society that embraces multiculturalism in which communities maintain their unique way of life at the same time living harmoniously'.</p><p>What More Can Be Done?</p><p>There are many constructive steps governments can take to strengthen societal bonds and social cohesion. They include encouraging politicians to refrain from using divisive rhetoric, promoting greater dialogue and interaction between different racial and religious groups to foster mutual respect and understanding, nurturing shared values across communities, and working with Big Tech to better regulate social media and remove postings advocating hate and violence.</p><p>There are other innovative ways to work more positively towards long-term harmonious co-existence, not just within but also across borders. 'People all over the world think of themselves as peace loving and tolerant of other groups, yet enmities and conflict exist. There is an urgent need for better communication and dialogue among different communities,' said Singapore President Halimah Yacob in an interview on 14 May 2019 in Beijing where she was to deliver a speech at the inaugural Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilisations.</p><p>To this end, President Halimah announced that the first International Conference on Cohesive Societies will be held in Singapore from 19-21 June 2019.</p><p>The conference will serve as a platform to bring together local and international thought leaders to share their experiences and ideas on how to encourage collective action to bridge the widening divides within societies and strengthen social cohesion.</p><p>The Need to Act</p><p>Cross-border influences are likely to grow as the world becomes more interconnected, thanks to technology and the movement of peoples across borders. At the same time, according to the 2018 Report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, instances of xenophobia, intolerance, and terrorism are on the rise, with right-wing violent attacks in Europe increasing at least three-fold in four years.</p><p>Governments have to be vigilant and take serious note of such phenomenon. Some governments are already dealing with it through policy, legislation and community efforts. The exploitation of race and religion may be politically expedient, but it also encourages dangerous sentiments that can lead to conflict and chaos.</p><p>There has to be an acknowledgement by governments that societies today are under extreme pressure from centrifugal forces. Unless decisive action is taken to encourage tolerance and cohesion within societies, these forces can tear societies apart. It is therefore imperative that governments take active measures to promote harmonious relations between racial, religious and cultural groups to ensure a peaceful and better future for all.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHMMES-KHUMERTIMES2105201900003</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHMMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-1Y21-JCH9-G516-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472532</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khmer Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Khmer Times</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18289\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 21, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

These events also caused disquiet around the <br/>world on what appears to be emerging trends within countries.</p><p>Attitudes towards Racial, Religious, and Cultural Differences</p><p>Countering the white supremacist far-right and Islamist extremists <br/>must be a major priority of all governments. Politicians from the left <br/>and right of the political spectrum play an important role in promoting <br/>peace and harmony between different social and ethnic groups.</p><p>Unfortunately, some have acted indifferently, even irresponsibly, <br/>towards the increasingly apparent racial, religious, and cultural <br/>divisions within their borders. Instead of attempting to bridge such <br/>divides, these politicians deepen the chasms with divisive rhetoric and <br/>hate speech.</p><p>In Europe and elsewhere, some politicians have increasingly given <br/>voice to extremist rhetoric in their quest for votes and popular <br/>support. Such tactics are cause for alarm, especially since studies have<br/>shown that leaders have a direct impact on setting the political tone <br/>for the country (and sometimes the world) and implementing policies on <br/>race and religion.</p><p>Some countries have taken an exclusive approach towards the minority <br/>groups within their territories, instead of being inclusive and <br/>culturally sensitive to them. As a result, some who feel marginalised <br/>and discriminated leave the country to support extremist causes.</p><p>Many governments also struggle with the proliferation of hate speech on the Internet on platforms such as Facebook.</p><p>Bridging Racial and Cultural Divides</p><p>What can governments do to create a more harmonious coexistence in <br/>our increasingly heterogeneous societies? Harmonious coexistence may <br/>have been a given in societies that for generations were largely <br/>homogeneous, whether for reasons of ethnicity, such as in the countries <br/>of East Asia or Scandinavia, or for reasons of beliefs, such as in the <br/>United States or Europe.</p><p>But homogeneity may be a thing of the past.</p><p>In today's globalised setting, homogeneity is progressively giving <br/>way to plurality as a result of increased people-to-people exchanges, <br/>immigration, and digital technology. The resultant greater diversity of <br/>peoples, beliefs, and opinions can easily become a crucible for racial, <br/>religious, and cultural tensions and divisions, if not managed <br/>carefully.</p><p>As such, harmonious coexistence is no longer a luxury but a <br/>necessity, and one that must be consistently embraced by the highest <br/>levels of government and across every sector of the population. If we <br/>want a garden to be filled with healthy plants, we have to tend it with <br/>deliberate love and care.</p><p>Singapore's Potential Role as Bridge Builder</p><p>Singapore is an interesting case study for the fostering of <br/>harmonious coexistence \u2014 one of the fundamental guiding principles of <br/>the country's governance is respect for pluralism and diversity of race,<br/>religion and culture. This cardinal principle has been followed through<br/>in law, policy and practice since the country's independence.</p><p>The government has secured common spaces for all religious and <br/>non-religious groups to coexist and flourish. To protect the sanctity of<br/>this negotiated space, special laws have been enacted against hate and <br/>attempts to incite enmity and ill-will between different racial and <br/>religious groups. This is extended to the online world.</p><p>Singapore's multi-cultural efforts have been recognised. In March <br/>2019, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, a US-based inter-faith group <br/>announced that Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will receive <br/>the 2019 World Statesman Award for \"fostering a society that embraces <br/>multiculturalism in which communities maintain their unique way of life <br/>at the same time living harmoniously\".</p><p>What More Can Be Done</p><p>So what more can governments do?</p><p>There are many constructive steps governments can take to strengthen <br/>societal bonds and social cohesion. They include encouraging politicians<br/>to refrain from using divisive rhetoric, promoting greater dialogue and<br/>interaction between different racial and religious groups to foster <br/>mutual respect and understanding, nurturing shared values across <br/>communities, and working with Big Tech to better regulate social media <br/>and remove postings advocating hate and violence.</p><p>There are other innovative ways to work more positively towards <br/>long-term harmonious co-existence, not just within but also across <br/>borders. \"People all over the world think of themselves as peace loving <br/>and tolerant of other groups, yet enmities and conflict exist. There is <br/>an urgent need for better communication and dialogue among different <br/>communities,\" said Singapore President Halimah Yacob in an interview on <br/>14 May 2019 in Beijing where she was to deliver a speech at the <br/>inaugural Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilisations.</p><p>To this end, President Halimah announced that the first International<br/>Conference on Cohesive Societies will be held in Singapore from 19-21 <br/>June 2019.</p><p>The conference will serve as a platform to bring together local and <br/>international thought leaders to share their experiences and ideas on <br/>how to encourage collective action to bridge the widening divides within<br/>societies and strengthen social cohesion.</p><p>The Need to Act</p><p>Cross-border influences are likely to grow as the world becomes more <br/>interconnected, thanks to technology and the movement of peoples across <br/>borders. At the same time, according to the 2018 Report by the Centre <br/>for Strategic and International Studies, instances of xenophobia, <br/>intolerance, and terrorism are on the rise, with right-wing violent <br/>attacks in Europe increasing at least three-fold in four years.</p><p>Governments have to be vigilant and take serious note of such <br/>phenomenon. Some governments are already dealing with it through policy,<br/>legislation and community efforts. The exploitation of race and <br/>religion may be politically expedient, but it also encourages dangerous <br/>sentiments that can lead to conflict and chaos.</p><p>There has to be an acknowledgement by governments that societies <br/>today are under extreme pressure from centrifugal forces. Unless <br/>decisive action is taken to encourage tolerance and cohesion within <br/>societies, these forces can tear societies apart. It is therefore <br/>imperative that governments take active measures to promote harmonious <br/>relations between racial, religious and cultural groups to ensure a <br/>peaceful and better future for all.</p><p>*Jeanne Conceicao is a Visiting Fellow with the S.

They have to do something that indicates forward motion come early autumn.\"1. The Justice Department vs. Google: Attorney General Bill Barr has signaled his agency is full steam ahead on its investigation into Google, with The Wall Street Journal reporting[1] the DOJ is preparing to bring a case as soon as this summer. </p><p>The probe, which came to light in June 2019,[2] includes a review of Google's position in the ad tech marketplace, and the Journal indicated investigators are also looking at Google's search practices. Obama-era antitrust enforcers recently outlined a roadmap[3] for an antitrust case against Google based on the digital ad marketplace. Google argues[4] the ad tech industry is crowded and competitive, saying its rivals in the space include household names like Amazon, AT&amp;#38;T, Facebook, Comcast and Oracle. 2. House Judiciary vs. Big Tech: The antitrust subcommittee's year-long investigation into competition in digital markets \u2014 focused on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google \u2014 is expected to wrap up in June. Chairman David Cicilline has said he wants to hear from the CEOs of the major companies, and put some muscle behind that request in a pointed letter to Amazon demanding testimony[5] from CEO Jeff Bezos.Cicilline told Politico[6] he wants to introduce legislation this year based on the report's recommendations, but it's unclear how far that will advance, given the pandemic. 3. State attorneys general vs. Google and Facebook: State antitrust enforcers announced multi-state coalition investigations into both Google and Facebook last year. The Google probe[7], led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, could lead to a lawsuit this fall, the WSJ reported. Paxton's office declined further comment.The Facebook investigation[8], led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, is proceeding despite the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman declined to comment on the status of the investigation. 4. The Federal Trade Commission vs. Facebook: Last July the social media giant revealed[9] that the FTC was conducting an antitrust probe. Reports indicate the agency is reviewing whether Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were anticompetitive. While Chairman Joe Simons said earlier this year he'd like to see the agency's tech investigations wrap up by the end of the year, the FTC has also noted that the coronavirus pandemic could affect timelines of investigations overall.\"We are working with parties, both third parties and [civil investigative demand] recipient parties that are under investigation to address the timing constraints and the issues surrounding their ability to comply in a timely manner,\" Ian Conner, director of the FTC's competition bureau, told Axios. He declined comment on the Facebook investigation. Between the lines: Action by one enforcer could add pressure on others to act as well. \"You can always explain why you're taking longer, but I think the decision by one major institution to act does increase the sense of urgency to get your matter under way,\" said Kovacic, who said he expects lawsuits filed by the end of the year. \"The sense that everyone is pressing ahead probably inspires added effort to reach that point of decision.\" Why it matters: Tech antitrust cases have a mixed record historically. Their impact on the industry and our lives is usually most felt not in specific remedies but in the power of the proceedings to tie down the giants[10].They tend to distract company leaders, discourage risk-taking at dominant firms, and clear space in the market for challengers. What's next: If antitrust lawsuits are formalized, companies and prosecutors will choose between pursuing a settlement of some kind or going to trial. If companies think a settlement makes sense for them, they might opt for a quick deal with a Republican administration.But they could also delay to see who wins in November and whether the election improves the political landscape for them.If cases go to trial, these conflicts could easily drag on for years.

The job that most Irish media organisations would like to see advertised might not ever come into existence, though the draft programme for government published last week has yanked it one step closer to reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under its provisions, the next coalition-by-default would \"bring together all policy functions relating to broadcast media, print media and online media into a single media division within a government department\".</p><p>At the moment, there's annoying number of doors to knock, inboxes to bother. A news outlet valiantly requesting that the perennially to-be-reviewed defamation law is actually reviewed? That's the Department of Justice. Lobbying for a VAT cut? You're wasting your time anywhere but the Department of Finance.</p><p>So far, so standard. A weirder division relates to public funding for screen content, with the modest pots split between the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI), which is overseen by the Department of Communications, and Screen Ireland, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Applying for the Section 481 tax credit for film, television drama, animation and creative documentary is again the Department of Culture (plus the Revenue Commissioners).</p><p>But it is the Department of Communications that is effectively the Department for RT\u00c9 and the Department for Radio, while last year it also tiptoed politely into the Big Tech sphere with the publication of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which the programme for government says the proposed coalition will enact.</p><p>The Department of Communications these days has the full title Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, with Communications coming first only in name. When there's a planet to fix, the precise definition of \"television\" in television licence fee tends to lose out. Even the most fervent campaigners can see why the question of how to stabilise RT\u00c9's disastrous finances, critical to Irish culture as it may be, finds it difficult to compete with climate change for ministerial headspace and diary time.</p><p>When the programme for government says a single media division will be established \"within a government department\", the word \"within\" could mean anything from an unprecedented colonisation of the corner offices to \"don't mind us, we'll find a patch of the basement with a couple of plug points\".</p><p>But the risk of other priorities swamping the survival of the Irish media might lessen just a touch were the division to be located at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, not where it is an afterthought to emissions targets and renewable energy.</p><p>Of course, with the Green Party wobbling on whether or not to go into government, it would be premature to order any stationery.</p><h>'Real clout' That the Irish media industry isn't keen on the current multi-stop-shop isn't breaking news. In 2012, back when it was still known as National Newspapers of Ireland, Newsbrands Ireland made the case on the basis that it didn't know who it should be talking to about the awkward business of staying in business. The chairman of the organisation at the time, former Irish Farmers Journal editor Matt Dempsey, said the minister for media should be someone at Cabinet level \"with real clout\".</h><p>Eight years later, Cabinet clout remains elusive, but it is still progress to see so many bullet points in the media section of the programme for government lurking under the wider, grander heading \"reforming and reimagining our public life\". It was notable that, unlike the 2016 document, there even was a media section.</p><p>Screen Producers Ireland (SPI), the representative body for independent production companies chaired by former Green leader John Gormley, was among those to welcome the \"very positive\" proposals, which also include a signal that the government would \"ensure the full implementation\" of the European Union's audio-visual media services directive (a potential revenue-raiser) and the no-hostages-here promise to \"recognise the important role of Irish public service broadcasting in Irish life and the ongoing restructuring efforts at RT\u00c9 in the context of a changing media environment\".</p><p>For SPI chief executive Elaine Geraghty, a single media division would mean opportunities for reform and growth weren't missed. Both SPI and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), meanwhile, liked the bit about retitling the previously mooted Public Service Broadcasting Commission as a Future of Media Commission, which will report on the industry's struggles in a \"platform agnostic fashion\" within nine months.</p><p>NUJ Irish secretary S\u00e9amus Dooley welcomed the \"positive tone\", even if there was a \"lack of urgency\" in dealing with the financial crisis at RT\u00c9.</p><h>New commission The BAI was also a fan, with chief executive Michael O'Keeffe telling a webinar that the document contained \"interesting stuff\" that would benefit Irish media if implemented over the next 12 months. Here the chairs really do seem set for rearranging: the programme for government says that once the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill becomes law, the BAI will get its wished-for regeneration into the Media and Online Safety Commission.</h><p>Other bullet points were less impressive: the desire to enact the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill before the end of 2020, for example, seems dulled by the fact the amendment's measures to support local radio were first proclaimed three years ago.</p><p>Still, programmes for government are always more aspirational than inspirational. And it probably doesn't mean anything that the authors of this one snuck their thoughts on media and advertising - including the surprise declaration to end advertising self-regulation - on to page 137 of a 139-page document in which the last two pages were blank.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4285944</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606B-G461-JC8Y-8409-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 23, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CE</classCode><className>CULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926130QJ</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QBD</classCode><className>BROADCASTING REGULATION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQ3MzdDMEM4NDEwNDg3OUI5NEMyN0E5REE4MENGRjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzNFQTlENUZGNUIyNEUyMzhEOEZFNUEzNzYzNEE4Qzg</classCode><className>Broadcasting</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

I`m Chris Matthews in Washington. Leading off tonight: Can you hear me now? <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>got on the line with the American people last night, connecting on a wide range of matters affecting the country. It was in many ways a catch-up call. He wanted us to know what he`s working on, what he cares most about, what he has tried to do and hasn`t yet been able to do. He talked about resolve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We don`t quit. I don`t quit. Let`s seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once more!</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, just for exercise, did he follow through on my three suggestions to get the country believing in him again? I said he had to explain to the Americans how the great recession could have easily become a second-grade depression if he hadn`t taken drastic action as he did, that he had to focus on jobs and share the country`s number one concern, and he had to talk about some social issues that matter to liberals. Tonight, we`ll give a sharp look at last night`s address to Congress.</p><p>And the president talked about capturing or killing hundreds of al Qaeda terrorists last night, but what does he say to the \"Not in my back yard crowd,\" which now includes New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who says he agrees with those who don`t want to try 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in a downtown New York courthouse? Will mounting pressure force <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>to not try the top al Qaeda leader in federal court?</p><p>Also, it wasn`t exactly a \"You lie\" moment, but after the president took the unusual step of ripping the Supreme Court`s decision on campaign finance, Justice Samuel Alito shook his head and mouthed the words, \"That`s not true.\" A, who was right, and B, what`s the protocol here?</p><p>Plus, the latest on that botched entering of Senator Mary Landrieu`s offices by that conservative activist down in New Orleans.</p><p>And just how sordid can the <person><nameText>John Edwards </nameText></person>sex scandal get? Both John and Elizabeth have been working to deal with that book by the former campaign aide who once accepted paternity of Edwards`s child, and now the news that the political couple has separated. More tonight on the unveiling -- or rather, the unraveling of this one-time fast-rising political figure. That`s in the \"Politics Fix.\"</p><p>Let`s start, however, tonight with the president`s State of the Union address. Savannah Guthrie is NBC News`s White House correspondent. Thank you for joining us from the White House. You`re obviously outside. And Eugene Robinson is a Pulitzer Prize columnist for \"The Washington Post\" and an MSNBC political analyst.</p><p>First, I thought the president sought to describe, and he did last night, the abyss we almost went into last year, which is so hard to do, to tell the American people, There was this horror movie out here that I saved you from. But here he is, doing the best he can. Let`s listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second Depression. So we acted -- immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Eugene, the hardest thing in the world is to tell the people the terrible thing that was going to happen but didn`t happen because I did drastic things that have driven the deficit up to $1.4 trillion.</p><p>EUGENE ROBINSON, \"WASHINGTON POST,\" MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Exactly. That is a -- I guess the metaphor du jour is a \"heavy lift.\" That`s a heavy lift.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: That`s really hard to do. I saw Senator Jon Cornyn this morning, Republican from Texas, and already he was jumping on this and saying, Well, he`s been president for a year. He, you know, boosted the deficit to $1 trillion...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROBINSON: How could he be saying that it`s all Bush`s fault? You know, Can`t he just -- he`s the president now. And that`s what you`re going to hear from Republicans. So it`s difficult to make that case stick, but you`re going to hear a lot more of it from Democrats...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, I was watching Cornyn...</p><p>ROBINSON: ... not just the president.</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... last night. You watched him last night. I was watching. He was chuckling pretty hard...</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... because he knows that his people are all going to be on base because they`re afraid of right-wing primary challenges, right?</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes. Exactly. They`re not going to...</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s keeping them in order.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s go right now -- I also thought Mitch McConnell was doing his George Will imitation last night, with that certain kind of chuckle.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Savannah, last night, did the president feel he had to do this? Did he feel it went over, this statement of horror that didn`t come?</p><p>SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that`s a statement the president is willing to make at any opportunity, and makes often. I mean, his aides really feel that we can`t remind folks enough of where we were and what he inherited.</p><p>You know, we have asked questions -- I`ve asked it in press briefings -- of Robert Gibbs, you know, Is there any point at which the statute of limitation expires, when you stop blaming the Bush administration? But that is not how they see it. They don`t see it as, We`re blaming it. He says, I understand it`s my responsibility now. But we`ve got to set the scene. We`ve got to say, this is what the situation was and this is how far we`ve come.</p><p>They want to paint a compelling narrative, to tell a story, Look, we`re not where we want to be yet. We`re not at the promised land, but we`ve come far. That`s what the president tried to do at the beginning of this speech.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Savannah, you know what I think the problem this the administration faces is -- and this is about political conjecture as much as reporting -- you know, the favor that Herbert Hoover gave to President Roosevelt was that he not only caused the Great Depression back in the `30s, he lived through four years of it. So by the time FDR came into office, we all knew whose fault it was. We`d seen entirely it was a Republican fault, and all Roosevelt had to do was say, Happy days are here again.</p><p>This president has to say -- well, Gene, you pick up here.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes...</p><p>MATTHEWS: This president has to say, It could have been the Great Depression.</p><p>ROBINSON: It could have been because, you know, the crash happened, and then the Republicans were out of there immediately.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes. Right.</p><p>ROBINSON: And so...</p><p>MATTHEWS: It`s hard to prove.</p><p>ROBINSON: ... the initial cleanup and the bad times...</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK...</p><p>ROBINSON: ... really happened under a Democratic president.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Here`s one for you. Here`s the president talking about what everybody thought he should have did, and I think he did. Here`s the president -- I wanted them to hear -- I wanted him -- everybody to talk about jobs. We have 10 percent unemployment rate in this country. People are scared. When people get scared, they get angry. They get angry at him. Here he is from last night, the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from, who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010, and that`s why I`m calling for a new jobs bill tonight!</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Savannah, do they think at the White House that they`ve got enough, to use the term Gene just did about lifting -- do they have enough heft in this jobs bill? They`re talking about $30 billion released from the TARP money. They`re talking about a new rapid transit system to take us from Tampa to Orlando. Is this enough? Or is this boutique?</p><p>GUTHRIE: Well, look, once you peel away some of the rhetoric and really look at if there`s any \"there\" there, you recognize that short of spending another $500 billion, there`s only so much they can do on jobs. I mean, the high-speed rail that you mentioned, that the president was in Tampa talking about today, that`s actually a Recovery Act funds.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>GUTHRIE: That`s a stimulus thing that went -- you know, was from a year ago, but they`re now doing the grants. And there is this jobs bill that passed through the House. They`re trying to get it through the Senate. There are things there they can do. I mean, they want to do the small business tax cuts. They want to do the jobs -- the hiring tax credit. And they want to do that.</p><p>But in some ways, it`s sort of chipping around the edges because there`s just no way they`re going to get the kind of stimulus through again to make a huge dent in unemployment. And this is a problem for them.</p><p>Here`s the thing. They put a lot of tax cuts, a lot of Republican darlings forward, and it`s almost a dare to Republicans to vote against it. And everybody agrees, by the way, Chris, right now, jobs comes first.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Health care -- first of all, nobody knows how they`re going to get it passed. But second of all, even if they did, they`re not going to do it now. They want to do jobs first.</p><p>MATTHEWS: You know, I want your thoughts.</p><p>ROBINSON: Well...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Is it big enough?</p><p>ROBINSON: Exactly. What is this really going to do? I think the tax cuts, the tax credits for small businesses, that could have some impact. But you know, there are a lot of economists who believe that, ideally, you would have another really sizable stimulus to really pump some money into the economy. Now, there`s stuff that the Fed can do in terms of keeping credit available, and this and that. And we`re talking huge amounts of money, and I think the Fed is prepared to keep the spigot open. But the reality is, there`s only so fast you can make the jobs number come up.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: I mean, there`s only so fast you can do that unless you just go out and start hiring people.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, what abut -- you know, we built the Empire State Building in the middle of the Great Depression, you know?</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: When you have cheap labor out there because the labor market`s down, because people are unemployed, it seems like a good time to start hiring construction workers and build a fast transit system across the country. Why don`t we build Monahan (ph) Station in New York?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: What stops us from doing stuff? I mean, just -- I`m serious.</p><p>ROBINSON: Yes.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I mean, maybe I`m talking old-time liberalism, Tip O`Neill stuff, Robert Moses stuff. But what`s wrong with putting people to work in construction jobs? You can actually watch them on the street, building things like railroads, bringing back the big Bud plants, the big Boeing plants, building trains, building subways...</p><p>ROBINSON: I think...</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... building stuff that moves people...</p><p>ROBINSON: I think there are a lot of...</p><p>MATTHEWS: ... that creates infrastructure for the future.</p><p>ROBINSON: I think there are a lot of liberal economists who would say exactly that, Let`s find a way to...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: ... get this money into the system, put people to work.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: Maybe you build a national high-speed rail network.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: Although that`s -- you know, that`s...</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, let`s talk about the social issues. Excuse me. Let`s talk about the social issues. Finally, the -- I wanted the president to remind the left why they wanted him in the job in the first place, to give them something to take home. Here is something on Civil Rights and gays in the military, open service by gay people. Let`s listen to what he said. I think he slipped it in. But here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: We must continually renew this promise. My administration has a Civil Rights division that is once again prosecuting Civil Rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>OBAMA: We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate. This year...</p><p>OBAMA: This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are!</p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Was that enough?</p><p>ROBINSON: Well, is it enough, really? I mean, I think the left was generally pleased with the speech. I`m not hearing some sort of huge hue and cry that he`s gone to the right, that he`s forsaken health care...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: ... that he`s not doing all this stuff. Specifically on \"Don`t ask, don`t tell,\" what I have kept hearing from the administration for some time now is that the president`s very serious about moving with this, but they want to lay the groundwork, particularly with the military brass. They didn`t want a situation where they`d roll something out and then the military brass would immediately go up to...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: ... up to the Hill and shoot it down.</p><p>MATTHEWS: But can he get it done? Can we do it?</p><p>ROBINSON: Well -- but there`s a timetable. This year? No.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>ROBINSON: I`d say no.</p><p>MATTHEWS: You know, I was watching -- Savannah, I was watching Markos Moulitsos last night, a leader of the people on the liberal side of things, the progressive side. He seemed very happy with the speech last night. Is that a leading indicator that it did work with the base? Your thoughts.</p><p>GUTHRIE: Oh, well, yes, I think to the extent that Markos speaks for that wing of the Democratic Party, sure. And look, I`ll tell you, White House officials would dispute that they really have a problem with the base. They think this is another one of these fictions of the media and that if you look at polls, the left is still very much with <person><nameText>President Obama.</nameText></person></p><p>On \"Don`t ask, don`t tell\" -- I mean, look, he`s said this before. This has always been his policy. And I think the proof will be in the pudding. Is this something they try to move forward with, with all deliberate speed, or are they going to slow walk it? So I think in the coming days and weeks, we`ll know how serious they are about it. It`s clearly a principle of his. He wants to do it, it`s just how quickly can he do it, and will it be fast enough for the left.</p><p>ROBINSON: What I heard this morning from somebody in the White House was probably not this year, but maybe that we would be hearing from military brass at some point.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK. Well, Thank you. That`s the beginning of the program tonight. Thank you.</p><p>We`re going to be right back with -- and talk about the other issue tonight, of the big issue about that trial in New York. Coming up, the topic the president didn`t spend much time on last night, of course, that trial coming up in New York with KSM, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. The mayor of New York now has turned against the president. He`s with the wind up there. He`s with the people, I guess -- Not in my back yard. He`s up there against trying the 9/11 mastermind in federal court at Foley Square up there. This is going to be one red-hot issue. This is going to put the O.J. trial, the Lindbergh trial off the score here. This is going to be the big one -- Foley Square, the trial of the mastermind of 9/11, just five blocks away.</p><p>You`re watching HARDBALL, only on MSNBC.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL. President Obama`s facing mounting political pressure up in New York to reverse course on his decision to try 9/11 mastermind KSM, he`s called -- Khalid Shaikh Mohammed -- in federal court in downtown New York City. Six senators have called on the attorney general to try the al Qaeda terrorist in a military commission. And on Wednesday, New York city mayor Michael Bloomberg backtracked on his support, which he gave earlier, for trying him in downtown New York and suggested instead that the trial take place on a military base.</p><p>Let`s watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (R), NEW YORK CITY: The federal government could find a site that didn`t cost $1 billion, which using downtown will. And it will also impact traffic and commerce and people`s lifestyles downtown. And it would be great if we didn`t do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Lifestyles downtown. Pat Buchanan`s an MSNBC political analyst -- a little more hard-nosed fellow than worried about lifestyles -- and Julie Menin is the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in Manhattan. She`s been pushing for the trial to be held on Governor`s Island.</p><p>You don`t like the location, Julie. You don`t like it being in Foley Square in downtown New York, right near 9/11. Why not?</p><p>JULIE MENIN, NYC COMMUNITY BOARD #1: Well, that`s absolutely right, Chris. It makes no sense whatsoever to have this trial in lower Manhattan. We`re the fourth largest commercial business district in the country. It`s the financial capital of the country. It`s the only neighborhood that`s been attacked twice by terrorists. Why on earth would we have this trial here? And why would we spend a billion dollars to hold this trial here?</p><p>We`ve got to remember that 9/11 caused $83 billion of economic damage to New York City. So why would we go down that road again? It makes no sense. And we`re demanding that the trial be moved.</p><p>MATTHEWS: And you want it moved over to Governor`s Island across the river, right?</p><p>MENIN: Well, Governor`s Island is one idea. The mayor had some issues about that. So earlier in the week, I proposed military installations, specifically military installations within the southern district of New York, like Stewart Air Base and West Point. And I`m asking Attorney General Holder to look at them. The military bases would be a political compromise between those Republicans that want a military tribunal and those Democrats that want a federal court trial.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Pat, your thoughts about a trial and all the cartoonish aspect of it that I think is coming.</p><p>PAT BUCHANAN, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. Well, I think that`s coming. Well, clearly, I think they`re going to have to get it out of lower Manhattan. When Bloomberg says that, I`m sure Harold Ford and Gillibrand will be in on this, Peter King already is.</p><p>MATTHEWS: And their point of view will be? Not in my back yard.</p><p>BUCHANAN: Get it out of New York City first and foremost. But secondly, the president`s got a serious problem, and so does Holder, because of the aspect of this trial, which is going to be turned into a circus by a good defense attorney.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Right.</p><p>BUCHANAN: I mean, the Miranda rights of this guy have been trampled upon as nobody else has had in the history of the world -- 183 times he was waterboarded! They said, We`re going to kill your family if you don`t talk. This guy -- and then you bring in John McCain and you ask him, You said waterboarding is torture. Was my client tortured?</p><p>MENIN: But Pat...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUCHANAN: ... says, Yes, he was.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Julie Menin, that`s a larger issue. Can you try this guy in court and win?</p><p>MENIN: Absolutely. We should have the venue as the federal courts. We`ve got to remember that in the Bush administration, we had hundreds of terrorists prosecuted in the federal court systems. How many did we have in the military tribunals? Two. And both of those had to be actually switched over to the federal court system precisely because government lawyers and the Bush administration were concerned that the Supreme Court would rule parts of those trials unconstitutional.</p><p>I want to see KSM prosecuted, and the best venue to do so is in the federal court system. And the idea that I`m proposing, which the mayor backs, is military installations would hold a federal court trial there.</p><p>A federal judge could preside over it. And you give the imprimatur of a military trial to it...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: But wouldn`t you still have the problem you would have to impanel a New York City jury from the Manhattan district, right? Wouldn`t you have to find local people?</p><p>And could you find a jury of 12 people, plus alternates where you could be pretty sure they weren`t up to something, that they weren`t going in that jury with the purpose of maybe writing a book, of offering a weird, weird verdict, like innocent?</p><p>MENIN: I would tell you, Chris, I absolutely think so. As a regulatory attorney, I really think that you`re going to get an impartial jury, and you can get an impartial jury in New York -- 9/11 affected everyone in the United States.</p><p>I don`t buy the argument that you can`t have New Yorkers as jurors in this trial.</p><p>BUCHANAN: Well, the trouble with some of these juries, first, Mrs. Surratt was tried at Fort McNair hanged at Fort McNair.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Who is Mrs. Surratt? I`m sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUCHANAN: She was in on the Lincoln assassination, or said to be in on the Lincoln assassination.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK.</p><p>BUCHANAN: They had a military tribunal down there, tried him and hung them right there at the fort.</p><p>But, look, Chris, they don`t realize, American trials, civil trials are part game. You get these dream team attorneys on one side. The reporters go in. The prosecution had some good points today. Defense...</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>BUCHANAN: They will be out after it`s over standing there, the attorneys will, in front of those cameras.</p><p>And if Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is smart, he will get someone to argue the case of the Islamic terrorist protest, what`s been done to the Palestinians, what`s been done to the Iraqis, what the Americans have done, put the United States on trial and get a lawyer in there to do it. And that will be a disaster for <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and for this country.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MENIN: But, Pat, you already had that with KSM and the military tribunal.</p><p>You`ve got to remember, at the end of the Bush administration, they put him in a military tribunal, and he spewed all of his rhetoric. And media was there and they reported on it. So, you still that kind of circus-like atmosphere, whether it`s in a military tribunal or in a federal court of law.</p><p>My question to you, Pat, is why is that Republicans are now up in arms over this? Where were they in terms of the hundreds of terrorists who were prosecuted in the federal court system, like Richard Reid?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Julie, let`s hear what senator-elect Scott Brown had to say in his victory speech to know what has changed in the atmosphere. Here he is. Let`s listen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUCHANAN: All right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT BROWN (R), MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR-ELECT: I believe, and I know all of you believe, that our Constitution and laws exist to protect this nation. They do not grant rights and privileges to enemies in wartime.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>BROWN: In dealing with terrorists, our tax dollars, our tax dollars should pay for weapons to stop them and not lawyers to defend them.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Joy, your response to senator-elect Scott Brown?</p><p>MENIN: First of all, I want to see KSM brought to justice. And if we follow the senator`s logic, I don`t think he would be brought to justice under the military tribunal, because I think the Supreme Court is going to knock down certain parts of it. We have got to remember that hearsay is admissible in a military tribunal. Hearsay is not admissible in a federal court of law.</p><p>Why would we take that risk and go down that road?</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s take a look at what the president said last night.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUCHANAN: Let me talk about the absurdity of this, Chris.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK.</p><p>BUCHANAN: Look, Reid, the shoe bomber, he should have been taken off the plane, interrogated. Who gave you this idea? Who made these shoes for you? Did they give you some other ideas how to bring bombs in? Where did you learn this? We want information to save lives.</p><p>MATTHEWS: I agree.</p><p>BUCHANAN: I don`t care what happens to Richard Reid. I don`t care what happens to the underwear bomber.</p><p>After 12 hours, they said you could get a lawyer and he shut up completely. We want information to save lives and win and end a war.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Here`s Dianne Feinstein, one of the most level-headed senators I think there is, Dianne Feinstein, who is a member of the Intelligence -- I think she`s chair of the Intelligence Committee. Here`s what she said about the trial today. Let`s listen to Senator Feinstein.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D), CALIFORNIA: I think the dynamic has changed now. And I think that the administration ought to listen to the mayor, listen to the mayor`s concern, and, candidly, make a change. There is nothing wrong with making a change.</p><p>The administration has flexibility. It can try somebody in an Article 3 court, decide to do it, change its mind, put that individual into a military commission. So, the administration has total control of this. And I think the situation has changed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Julie, I often look to Senator Feinstein for sort of the true north in American politics. People think she`s a liberal. She`s very centrist in her thinking and I think very mature in her outlook in terms of jurisprudence and all. She`s been through hell in her life as an executive in San Francisco, and very much involved in the system all these years out there, in the court system.</p><p>She knows what she`s talking about. What do you think? She says go back to the military approach. What -- you don`t agree?</p><p>MENIN: I like my hybrid approach, which is have it in a military installation, but have a federal court judge preside over it. And that`s a compromise solution.</p><p>I get very worried about these military tribunals. I get very worried about whether they`re going to be successful or not.</p><p>And if our ultimate goal is to bring KSM to justice, shouldn`t we do everything possible to reach that goal?</p><p>MATTHEWS: I`m just afraid that a young person can go to law school now and finish by the time this trial is over, that this trial is going to go on and on. We`re going to be hearing arguments about water-boarding.</p><p>And any young, smart, liberal attorney is going to say, how can you say this person is given a fair trial after how many water-boardings, 183?</p><p>MENIN: One hundred and eighty-three.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: And that didn`t give the prosecution the evidence. And you got the tainted fruit here, or whatever it`s called. You`ve got a real problem with this evidence.</p><p>MENIN: Exactly.</p><p>MATTHEWS: It came from torture.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: So, how can you win the case? That`s what I keep asking.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUCHANAN: Dianne Feinstein also has something else in mind. She`s a good solid Democrat. She sees the terrible problems, A, with having it in downtown New York.</p><p>Suppose some bomber like that anarchist bomber down at Wall Street blows people up. That`s the end of the Obama administration. And, secondly, I think she sees the problem of these lawyers coming out and making the case for al Qaeda on American television.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, I`m afraid Foley Square is going to be the new ground zero, because they will be looking at. You know they will be looking at it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MENIN: Let me ask you this. Pat, why don`t you support this idea of having the trial on a military installation? Why can`t it be in West Point and have it as a federal court trial?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BUCHANAN: West Point is a place of honor in America. The symbolism is appalling. OK with your Air Force base or something like that. Don`t use West Point for this, but use a military tribunal on this guy.</p><p>He`s a prisoner of war who engaged in a horrible atrocity against the United States. He needs a Nuremberg tribunal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK, I`m closer to Pat on this than you would believe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Anyway, thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MENIN: Thank you.</p><p>MATTHEWS: It`s great to have you on, Julie. Please come back and we will argue this at length forever, I think, but it`s an important argument.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Pat Buchanan.</p><p>It`s not just about venue. It`s about what kind of a trial, military or civilian.</p><p>Up next: Surprise. Rudy Giuliani picks a fight with <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>about the speech last night. I`m not sure he was too attentive last night, the former mayor. He says the president didn`t even mention the Christmas Day terror attempt. Well, he did. And, once again, I think he`s got his facts wrong, the mayor. Are you watching, Rudy? You got it wrong last night.</p><p>You`re watching HARDBALL, only on MSNBC.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Back to HARDBALL. Now for the \"Sideshow.\"</p><p>Did you ever hear how every witness in a trial has a different story, how no two people remember the same thing the same way? Well, here`s a wild example.</p><p>Here`s Rudy Giuliani`s memory of what we all watched on TV last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDOLPH GIULIANI (R), FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The president last night, in his State of the Union speech, ignored national security, one or two mentions of it, didn`t talk about KSM, didn`t talk about the Christmas almost bomber, didn`t mention the word war last night, didn`t mention the word Islamic terrorism last night.</p><p>This would be like Franklin Roosevelt giving a State of the Union speech during the Second World War and not mentioning Nazism and not mentioning the war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Now, thanks to videotape, we can show you the reality.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You know, throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security.</p><p>Since the day I took office, we renewed our focus on the terrorists who threatened our nation. We made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence.</p><p>And, in the last year, hundreds of al Qaeda`s fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed, far more than in 2008.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Can you imagine the former mayor, the former U.S. prosecutor, Rudy Giuliani, in the witness chair on last night`s speech? I`m only guessing, but I think, during last night`s speech, Rudy and Judy were doing a little channel surfing, or whatever.</p><p>Next, two of the tea party movement`s biggest stars, Congresswoman Michele Bachmann and Marsha Blackburn, just pulled out of next week`s big tea party convention down in Nashville. Both cited the event`s murky financial arrangements in their decision.</p><p>Sarah Palin, she`s still in.

I take the train all the time between New York and D.C. These trips, by the way, down there average 84 miles an hour between New York and Washington. So, how fast will these soon-to-be-built trains between Tampa and Orlando -- up to 168 miles per hour. Pretty fast, huh? A hundred and sixty-eight miles per hour trains coming to Florida, tonight`s \"I`m going to Disney World\" \"Big Number.\"</p><p>Up next, we will get the latest on the attempt to tamper with the phones in Senator Mary Landrieu`s office down in New Orleans.</p><p>Plus, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito mouthed the words \"not true\" when <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>took a swipe at the Supreme Court`s decision on campaign finance.

Now for the latest on two legal stories, the big one, four conservative activists charged with tampering with the phone system in Senator Mary Landrieu`s office the other day. What do they face?</p><p>Well, the Supreme Court Justice Alito also showed some disagreement with a line in President Obama`s speech last night. Was he out of line himself?</p><p>Joining me now is Jonathan Turley, professor at George Washington University, who knows a lot about a lot and always surprises me.</p><p>So, I have no idea what you`re going to say.</p><p>What do you make of these characters -- I think that`s fair to call them that -- they may be felons when the end of this is all over -- going into a senator`s office down in New Orleans, her local office, Mary Landrieu`s, and doing something with the phone system, masquerading as telephone equipment-fixers, cutting the lines, doing things, entering space they shouldn`t be in, facing now 10 years in prison for some hijinks?</p><p>And their defense is, what, they wanted to catch the senator`s staff acting nonchalant or whimsical once the lines were cut because they`re tired of taking negative calls on the health bill?</p><p>JONATHAN TURLEY, CONSTITUTIONAL ATTORNEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Well, that`s the weird thing, is, these are people that seem to have room temperature I.Q.s.</p><p>It`s astonishing that they found each other and came up with this idea.</p><p>MATTHEWS: That is dangerous, when people of slight intellect get together.</p><p>TURLEY: Right. Exactly. And they still have their addresses pinned to their shirts when they do this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: You mean like a...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TURLEY: So, you really have a problem.</p><p>And, occasionally, as a defense attorney, you reach these people, and say you go, you`re a disgrace to criminals around the world. But they`re looking at serious problems here. Now, the big issue, however, is that the affidavit itself says that they are charging for this trespass charge with the intent to commit a felony.</p><p>The question is what that felony is. If you don`t have that felony, it drops dramatically.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes.</p><p>TURLEY: So, the 10 years is really kicking in on a felony. They don`t say what the felony is.</p><p>MATTHEWS: But if they have any tools with them, does that tell you that they`re going to do something illegal?</p><p>TURLEY: Well, it seems to me that when they talk about malicious interference, they`re talking about only one of two things. Either is -- one is surveillance. They didn`t seem to have electronic surveillance devices on them.</p><p>The other is to stop the phone system, to destroy it, to interrupt it. Either one would be very, very serious. They would be looking at a serious charge. They already are. But it`s also something a prosecutor is not likely to drop.</p><p>It`s more likely prosecutors are going to put pressure on these young kids, maybe the prosecutor`s son that is one of them, to see if any of them will turn on O`Keefe. O`Keefe is obviously...</p><p>MATTHEWS: He`s the ringleader, apparently.</p><p>TURLEY: Yes, he`s obviously going to be the target.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Well, let me ask you about this, just the -- well, let`s take a look at it.</p><p>Here`s a statement that came out from the spokesperson in Senator Mary Landrieu`s office just now. Senator Landrieu believes \"this feeble explanation that we`re getting about what the purpose was, to embarrass the office, is a clear and calculated effort to divert attention away from the fact that his client stands accused of a federal crime that could land him in prison for up to ten years. The fact remains that they perpetrated a false identity scheme on building security by posing as telephone workers in an attempt to manipulate the phones in her office. The only people these four individuals have embarrassed is themselves and their families.\"</p><p>Well, embarrassment is the least of their worries right now. If you went to a federal building right now, and you went to a senator`s office, all these federal buildings in big cities around the country, and you snuck into the office and you snuck back in, using a uniform, a workman`s uniform, and you went in and started cutting the wires, what would that crime be, if you knew nothing else about the case, about the motive, about the politics or who these people were? What would that be?</p><p>TURLEY: The most obvious one is 1036, which they were charged under. In terms of the felony, there`s obstruction of federal property. There`s the possibility of surveillance. There`s also some other types of charges. If they lied to federal officials, either before or after, there`s an 18- USE-1001 charge, which also brings --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Your best bet, are these guys going to get a big fine, or are they going to get a year, something like it?</p><p>TURLEY: I think they`re going to look at serious jail terms, because the judge -- assuming the prosecutors can prove these facts -- they seem to be very confident. If they prove these facts, I think a judge is going to be very reluctant to say, well, this was a not-so-charming prank. This is a very serious problem.</p><p>MATTHEWS: What about tertiary or secondary guilt? Is it possible, if they sat down with some other parties, political people, that encouraged this act, this, whatever -- escapade or -- hijinx, could they be guilty?</p><p>TURLEY: Well, they call conspiracy the prosecutor`s darling for a very good reason. You can bring that against secondary parties. They can flip them. And it`s a serious problem. These four -- I`m surprised they were able to find the building together. So there may be some other people helping them.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Let`s take a look at something that happened last night, a bit of hijinx, apparently, on the floor of the United States House of Representatives last night. Here`s what <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>said about the recent Supreme Court decision in last night`s State of the Union. Let`s listen, and watch, as we do, Justice Samuel Alito`s reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our election.</p><p>I don`t think American elections should be bank rolled by America`s most powerful interests, or worse by foreign entities.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: What do you make of that? I couldn`t quite see it. Everybody`s talking about him saying, you know -- let`s -- we`re going to show it again. People say that he said something like, not true under his breath.</p><p>TURLEY: I`ve seen it, the close-up. It seems --</p><p>MATTHEWS: There he is. He`s shaking his head saying not true, apparently.</p><p>TURLEY: No one`s accusing him of a Jerry Springer moment. But this shouldn`t be belittled either. What happened there, to use a word, would be exceptionally injudicious.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Is he supposed to be like a soldier keeping guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier? Are they supposed to be totally at attention, without any aspect?</p><p>TURLEY: The tomb soldiers can show more emotion than the justices. They`re there are a symbol of two things, ad he blew one of them. One is the three branches coming together, which is important for democracy. The other is the utter neutrality and the apolitical values of the court. And for that reason, you`re not allowed to applaud. You`re not allowed to oppose. You`re not allowed to mimic.</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s a tough standard. Anyway, thank you Jonathan Turley, on all counts.</p><p>Up next, much more on what <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>did or didn`t accomplish in last night`s State of the Union. I thought it was a wonderful night for him. We`ll get the poll data coming in the next couple of days.</p><p>Plus, a new low in the saga of <person><nameText>John Edwards.</nameText></person> This is a sad story. As a human story, it`s sad. A man who was very high up in his expectations, maybe still high in his expectations, but not in his situation. They`re legally separated or about to be, apparently -- and somebody`s got a tape of him with this other woman. This is HARDBALL, only on MSNBC.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Welcome back to HARDBALL. About a week ago, <person><nameText>John Edwards </nameText></person>admitted he`s the father of his mistress` child. Now a former Edward aide drops a new bomb. Here`s Andrew Young, not the famous Andrew Young, in an ABC News interview with Bob Woodruff. Let`s listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW YOUNG, FMR. AIDE TO <person><nameText>JOHN EDWARDS</nameText></person>: There was one tape that was marked special. And we`re just aghast. It`s a sex tape of Rielle and <person><nameText>John Edwards,</nameText></person> made just a couple of months before the Iowa caucuses.</p><p>It`s amazing the tape exists. That`s unbelievable. But to leave it in a house that`s for sale, where realtors are going to be coming through it and leave it there for eight months, is unbelievable.</p><p>BOB WOODRUFF, ABC NEWS ANCHOR: Are you absolutely sure that this is <person><nameText>John Edwards </nameText></person>and Rielle Hunter?</p><p>YOUNG: It`s definitely him. You never see her face. It`s a visibly pregnant woman.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: Wow. I`m joined by Melinda Henneberger, I brought in for special duty. She`s from PoliticsDaily.com. And Clarence Page of the \"Chicago Tribune.\" You don`t have to enjoy this. It`s chadenfraude (ph). But it`s so strange.</p><p>Here`s this good looking guy, smart guy, great courtroom lawyer, rose right up to the Senate from North Carolina, beat an incumbent, which is rare. Headed towards the White House. Ends up being VP, running for the vice president of the United States. And now this.</p><p>MELINDA HENNEBERGER, POLITICSDAILY.COM: He`s behaved despicably. But this tape doesn`t change anything. For Andrew Young to come on here and say he is aghast. This is a man who helped <person><nameText>John Edwards </nameText></person>cheat on his cancer-stricken wife, who helped <person><nameText>John Edwards </nameText></person>deny his own flesh and blood. So he`s aghast about something --</p><p>MATTHEWS: So don`t buy brooks, buy crooks?</p><p>HENNEBERGER: I don`t care what this guy has to say. I`m not saying there`s not a tape. We don`t know. He`s a --</p><p>MATTHEWS: That`s an interesting point. Why are we talking about it, to be honest? I think Melinda`s raised a great point. But -- let`s go back to the tape, which I`m sure the people will be watching on some sort of thing on TV now. You can watch everything. Is the issue of this guy`s fault at all instructive? How high he went -- was he a false flier? Was he a morning glory? Was he a mistake, a mirage?</p><p>CLARENCE PAGE, \"THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE\": Makes you wonder about his narcissism. You have to ask questions about his character and about why he would behave this way. He`s man of uncommonly good intelligence, and was potentially a great presidential candidate, viable, and all that. But he just really crashed and burned here. We can see there was all this going on behind-the-scenes even while he was aspiring to the presidency.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Melinda, when he was in the room in Iowa, like you were watching it -- I`m sure you were out there. We were watching this guy. I have never seen a better small room politician.</p><p>HENNEBERGER: Right. I agree with that.</p><p>MATTHEWS: He was as good as Clinton, which is really saying something. Two hundred people in the room, hot room, packed in, dynamite.</p><p>PAGE: It was kind of canned, too, though.</p><p>MATTHEWS: OK.</p><p>PAGE: Some speeches that just right down to the stopwatch.</p><p>MATTHEWS: It`s easier to find a new audience than to find new material. But the material was working for me.</p><p>HENNEBERGER: You know what I keep going back to, though, their son Wade`s death in `96. I keep thinking, is this a family slow-mo destruction?</p><p>MATTHEWS: It happens.</p><p>HENNEBERGER: You go back to this moment. He would never have gone into politics, he said many times, if Wade had been alive. Then he has these children. They say that they had the kids as a response to Wade`s death. All these things that have happened since then, would any of this have ever occurred if they had --</p><p>MATTHEWS: Horrible things happen when you lose a child. Horrible things happen.</p><p>HENNEBERGER: Tragic.</p><p>PAGE: It is true.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Anyway, I think <person><nameText>John Edwards </nameText></person>ought to go back to practicing law, and he`d probably be a great lawyer, or else join the Peace Corps.</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>MATTHEWS: I think he is crazed to go back into elective office. But there`s a lot more things to do in life than run for office.</p><p>Before break, we learned yesterday that Howard Zinn died. A lot of people loved reading this guy. He was a leading political activist of the 20th century, a crusader for civil rights in this country, and a prominent opponent of the war in Vietnam. If you want to read some history from a left-wing point of view -- and you ought to he hear things from all points of view -- he was great. He wrote in his autobiography that he wanted his students to be more prepared to relinquish the safety of silence, more prepared to speak up, to act against injustice, wherever they saw it, a great lessen. Howard Zinn was 87.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: What frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is election day. We can`t wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATTHEWS: We are back with Melinda Henneberger and Clarence Page for more of the politics fix. You guys know politics very well. Melinda, you and I have been on the bus together. Clarence and I have been on one million television shows together by now. Let`s just talk about the atmosphere last night. I thought they were spectacular. I thought he commanded the country as head of state. He spoke for all of us. I thought he was teasing the Republicans in a charming way, maybe try to tease them in. Now you?</p><p>HENNEBERGER: I didn`t see it. I thought he was listless, churlish and internally inconsistent. We ran a pretty harsh assessment today by our new conservative columnist Pete Wayner, who worked for George W. Bush. I was sorry to --</p><p>MATTHEWS: What did you expect to hear from him?</p><p>HENNEBERGER: I was sorry to see how much of it I had to agree with. I thought there --</p><p>MATTHEWS: You are grimacing, Clarence.</p><p>PAGE: Often things don`t play well out in the hustings. We beltway people --</p><p>MATTHEWS: I think he charmed me again.

Doing so would \"unleash AWS's growth\" because it would eliminate any hesitance potential clients might feel about doing business with a company they compete against.  Tim Bray, an  Amazon vice president and senior engineer who resigned  in protest in May, is calling for the company to spin off its lucrative cloud-computing business.    Spinning off Amazon Web Services from the company's retail business would allow it to grow AWS even more, since Amazon would no longer risk alienating potential clients who are wary of working with a competitor, Bray said in a \" Squawk Box \" interview on Friday.   \"That's a headwind because you could be reluctant to sign a deal with a web services operator if you're worried that by doing so you're funding one of your competitors,\" Bray said. \"I think it would unleash AWS's growth, which is already very good, if it were not joined at the hip with Amazon.\"   AWS remains one of Amazon's biggest profit drivers. In the first quarter of 2020 , operating income from AWS totaled $3.08 billion, accounting for 77% of Amazon's overall operating income. However, AWS only represented 13.5% of Amazon's total revenue for the quarter.   Bray resigned dramatically from Amazon in May via a fiery blog post , in which he spurned the company's decision to fire two former user experience designers, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who were both outspoken critics of Amazon's labor practices. Bray said Amazon's decision to fire whistleblowers was \"evidence of a vein of toxicity running through the company culture\" and remaining at Amazon would have meant \"signing off on actions I despised.\"   Bray has laid out similar arguments for breaking up Amazon in the past.    In June, he  suggested in a blog post that Amazon might choose to proactively split off AWS from the company as an effort to get ahead of looming antitrust scrutiny.   Amazon's cloud business is reportedly being scrutinized  as part of an ongoing antitrust probe by the Federal Trade Commission into the company's retail operations. In addition to the FTC, Amazon is also being investigated by the House Judiciary Committee , which is overseeing an antitrust investigation into big tech companies.   Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, said in a June interview that Amazon would \"follow U.S. law\" and comply with regulators if they required a spinoff, but added that there isn't a benefit to separating AWS now. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42675368586</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F5-5791-JCSC-J15G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 24, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The cliff is better than 50 percent probability, and then comes the debt ceiling, exclamation point. Dysfunctional Washington bad for risk assets. Bad for business, it has to be, John.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN SCULLEY, FORMER <person><nameText>CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE</nameText></person>: Well, business focuses on uncertainty. And obviously we're in uncertain times. This Congress actually is still in session until January 3, and then -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EISEN: So there's hope yet.</p><p>SCULLEY: So there's still hope, but I think it's a very dysfunctional Congress overall. We're not going to correct that in the next few months. This is something that's going to take years to sort its way out.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Do you have a percentage of a fiscal cliff probability?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I don't think the risk of going over the cliff is as big as people are saying it is. The reality is if we go over the cliff, there are mechanisms to insulate the economy from it for a period of time. So the real test is to see what happens as we move out past the inauguration of the president and a new Congress comes into section.</p><p>EISEN: Well, no question dysfunctional is the word of the day. We'll talk more about this in just a moment with our White House correspondent Hans Nichols.</p><p>06:04</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:15</p><p>EISEN: How do you foster innovation and make profits at the same time? John Sculley led Pepsi into the cola wars. He faced ups and then downs at Apple, and he's now fostering innovation in healthcare. He joins us with a look ahead to the state of corporate America in 2013. John, our guest host for the hour. And tell us a little bit more about what you're investing in now. Healthcare technology.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well Sara, when I joined the personal computer industry 30 years ago, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>had this idea that the Macintosh wasn't just a computer. It was a consumer appliance and it should be sold with the same kind of big brand marketing that we used in the cola wars with Pepsi. Thirty years later, healthcare offers a similar kind of opportunity. We know we can't afford the system we have today, and yet there's a chance for disruptive delivery of healthcare services that focus on consumerization, and I think ultimately big brand marketing can play a role in that.</p><p>STEEL: So what kind of startups then maybe are you looking towards helping healthcare? I just don't see the correlation yet.</p><p>SCULLEY: Sure. Well, we have a healthcare system since the Second World War which is an employer-based system, meaning that there's no taxes for the employees who get the healthcare benefits which they get. With the Affordable Care Act, the president is shifting us to a mandated system, and the impact of that is that employers are starting to take on their own self-insurance.</p><p>They're going to high deductible plans, covering catastrophic health only in many cases. And this means that the first $3,000 to $5,000 every year has to be paid by the employees. They suddenly no longer have copays for that first $3,000 to $5,000.</p><p>That opens up a huge opportunity for alternative types of healthcare delivery systems like telehealth, meaning being able to have a doctor appointment online over your mobile device or over your PC, walk-in urgent care centers. There are now 9,000 of them in the US, about 25 percent penetration. So we're going to start to see real innovation I believe in the delivery of healthcare services and the ability to build brands around these services is going to be a huge focus I think for the healthcare industry.</p><p>EISEN: So this is the next it sounds like section of technology to watch. Are you talking about big tech innovation leaders like Apple?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I don't think you'll find companies like Apple going specifically into healthcare because it's such a field that requires deep knowledge of the protocols, rules, regulations of that particular industry. On the other hand, we're talking about a $2.8 trillion industry just in the United States. So the opportunity to disrupt the healthcare model is huge. And so Apple may be part of the system, but I think you're going to see other companies, even new companies, playing a more important role.</p><p>STEEL: And we don't have a lot of time on this, but this brings up the good question on should companies be innovating or should they be really putting their money into trying and make profit. Can you really do both right now in Silicon Valley?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, it depends if you have those skills. And clearly Apple has demonstrated time and again that it can do true product innovation. Other companies, particularly large public companies that have been around for a long time, set up an innovation department, usually not particularly successful.</p><p>EISEN: Well Tim Cook, the new boss who sits in your chair at Apple, recently speak to Bloomberg Businessweek of course in an interview. And he talked a lot about innovation and the (ph) chief innovation officer. He says they shouldn't have a chief innovation officer. In fact, a lot of companies have these departments and it's always a sign that something is wrong. And you have a VP of innovation or something, you know, put a for sale sign at the door because everybody there should be doing innovation. You shouldn't even have such tight (ph) officers as a title.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I think he completely nailed it. He's exactly right. Innovation is done best when you have strong product leadership. <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is obviously the best example of strong product leadership. Now Tim Cook is an outstanding CEO for Apple, but he's not the product leader. So he has to be able to empower a product leader -</p><p>EISEN: But he has a product leader.</p><p>SCULLEY: He does. Jony Ives is highly respected, very successful. Worked at Steve's right hand, and so he's got one clear product leader. Remember, he had two who were in competition with each other. He chose one, and I think it was a very good choice.</p><p>EISEN: Does Apple need a new product right now?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I just love the iPad Mini.</p><p>EISEN: Do you, really?</p><p>SCULLEY: I do, yeah. I think the iPad Mini has opportunities to get even better. I'd love - love to see the same high-resolution retina display in the iPad Mini they have on the iPad. I'd love to see the kind of keyboard accessory in the cover that even Microsoft has on the Surface. So I think the iPad Mini has got a great run. The challenge is that the gross margin on the iPad Mini is lower than Apple has had on the iPhone and the iPad.</p><p>EISEN: Well, we're going to talk a lot more about Apple and what it's got coming up.</p><p>06:20</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">06:03 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SARA EISEN, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: No question the top story of the day  though has to be the fiscal cliff's lack of a deal. Bill Gross, of course  of PIMCO, bond king, tweeting out that there's only a 50 percent chance or  better probability that we're going to get some kind of fiscal cliff. Bill  Gross, always provocative in his tweets. The cliff is better than 50  percent probability, and then comes the debt ceiling, exclamation point.  Dysfunctional Washington bad for risk assets. Bad for business, it has to  be, John.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN SCULLEY, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Well, business  focuses on uncertainty. And obviously we're in uncertain times. This  Congress actually is still in session until January 3, and then -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EISEN: So there's hope yet.</p><p>SCULLEY: So there's still hope, but I think it's a very dysfunctional  Congress overall. We're not going to correct that in the next few months.  This is something that's going to take years to sort its way out.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Do you have a percentage of a fiscal cliff  probability?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I don't think the risk of going over the cliff is as  big as people are saying it is. The reality is if we go over the cliff,  there are mechanisms to insulate the economy from it for a period of time.  So the real test is to see what happens as we move out past the  inauguration of the president and a new Congress comes into section.</p><p>EISEN: Well, no question dysfunctional is the word of the day. We'll  talk more about this in just a moment with our White House correspondent  Hans Nichols.</p><p>06:04</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:15</p><p>EISEN: How do you foster innovation and make profits at the same time?  John Sculley led Pepsi into the cola wars. He faced ups and then downs at  Apple, and he's now fostering innovation in healthcare. He joins us with a  look ahead to the state of corporate America in 2013. John, our guest host  for the hour. And tell us a little bit more about what you're investing in  now. Healthcare technology.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well Sara, when I joined the personal computer industry 30  years ago, Steve Jobs had this idea that the Macintosh wasn't just a  computer. It was a consumer appliance and it should be sold with the same  kind of big brand marketing that we used in the cola wars with Pepsi.  Thirty years later, healthcare offers a similar kind of opportunity. We  know we can't afford the system we have today, and yet there's a chance for  disruptive delivery of healthcare services that focus on consumerization,  and I think ultimately big brand marketing can play a role in that.</p><p>STEEL: So what kind of startups then maybe are you looking towards  helping healthcare? I just don't see the correlation yet.</p><p>SCULLEY: Sure. Well, we have a healthcare system since the Second  World War which is an employer-based system, meaning that there's no taxes  for the employees who get the healthcare benefits which they get. With the  Affordable Care Act, the president is shifting us to a mandated system, and  the impact of that is that employers are starting to take on their own  self-insurance. </p><p>They're going to high deductible plans, covering catastrophic health only  in many cases. And this means that the first $3,000 to $5,000 every year  has to be paid by the employees. They suddenly no longer have copays for  that first $3,000 to $5,000. </p><p>That opens up a huge opportunity for alternative types of healthcare  delivery systems like telehealth, meaning being able to have a doctor  appointment online over your mobile device or over your PC, walk-in urgent  care centers. There are now 9,000 of them in the US, about 25 percent  penetration. So we're going to start to see real innovation I believe in  the delivery of healthcare services and the ability to build brands around  these services is going to be a huge focus I think for the healthcare  industry.</p><p>EISEN: So this is the next it sounds like section of technology to  watch. Are you talking about big tech innovation leaders like Apple?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I don't think you'll find companies like Apple going  specifically into healthcare because it's such a field that requires deep  knowledge of the protocols, rules, regulations of that particular industry.  On the other hand, we're talking about a $2.8 trillion industry just in the  United States. So the opportunity to disrupt the healthcare model is huge.  And so Apple may be part of the system, but I think you're going to see  other companies, even new companies, playing a more important role.</p><p>STEEL: And we don't have a lot of time on this, but this brings up the  good question on should companies be innovating or should they be really  putting their money into trying and make profit. Can you really do both  right now in Silicon Valley?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, it depends if you have those skills. And clearly Apple  has demonstrated time and again that it can do true product innovation.  Other companies, particularly large public companies that have been around  for a long time, set up an innovation department, usually not particularly  successful.</p><p>EISEN: Well Tim Cook, the new boss who sits in your chair at Apple,  recently speak to Bloomberg Businessweek of course in an interview. And he  talked a lot about innovation and the (ph) chief innovation officer. He  says they shouldn't have a chief innovation officer. In fact, a lot of  companies have these departments and it's always a sign that something is  wrong. And you have a VP of innovation or something, you know, put a for  sale sign at the door because everybody there should be doing innovation.  You shouldn't even have such tight (ph) officers as a title.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I think he completely nailed it. He's exactly right.  Innovation is done best when you have strong product leadership. Steve Jobs  is obviously the best example of strong product leadership. Now Tim Cook is  an outstanding CEO for Apple, but he's not the product leader. So he has to  be able to empower a product leader - </p><p>EISEN: But he has a product leader.</p><p>SCULLEY: He does. Jony Ives is highly respected, very successful.  Worked at Steve's right hand, and so he's got one clear product leader.  Remember, he had two who were in competition with each other. He chose one,  and I think it was a very good choice.</p><p>EISEN: Does Apple need a new product right now?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I just love the iPad Mini.</p><p>EISEN: Do you, really?</p><p>SCULLEY: I do, yeah. I think the iPad Mini has opportunities to get  even better. I'd love - love to see the same high-resolution retina display  in the iPad Mini they have on the iPad. I'd love to see the kind of  keyboard accessory in the cover that even Microsoft has on the Surface. So  I think the iPad Mini has got a great run. The challenge is that the gross  margin on the iPad Mini is lower than Apple has had on the iPhone and the  iPad.</p><p>EISEN: Well, we're going to talk a lot more about Apple and what it's  got coming up.</p><p>06:20</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

The cliff is better than 50 percent probability, and then comes the debt ceiling, exclamation point. Dysfunctional Washington bad for risk assets. Bad for business, it has to be, John.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN SCULLEY, FORMER <person><nameText>CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE</nameText></person>: Well, business focuses on uncertainty. And obviously we're in uncertain times. This Congress actually is still in session until January 3, and then -</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EISEN: So there's hope yet.</p><p>SCULLEY: So there's still hope, but I think it's a very dysfunctional Congress overall. We're not going to correct that in the next few months. This is something that's going to take years to sort its way out.</p><p>ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Do you have a percentage of a fiscal cliff probability?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I don't think the risk of going over the cliff is as big as people are saying it is. The reality is if we go over the cliff, there are mechanisms to insulate the economy from it for a period of time. So the real test is to see what happens as we move out past the inauguration of the president and a new Congress comes into section.</p><p>EISEN: Well, no question dysfunctional is the word of the day. We'll talk more about this in just a moment with our White House correspondent Hans Nichols.</p><p>06:04</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>06:15</p><p>EISEN: How do you foster innovation and make profits at the same time? John Sculley led Pepsi into the cola wars. He faced ups and then downs at Apple, and he's now fostering innovation in healthcare. He joins us with a look ahead to the state of corporate America in 2013. John, our guest host for the hour. And tell us a little bit more about what you're investing in now. Healthcare technology.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well Sara, when I joined the personal computer industry 30 years ago, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>had this idea that the Macintosh wasn't just a computer. It was a consumer appliance and it should be sold with the same kind of big brand marketing that we used in the cola wars with Pepsi. Thirty years later, healthcare offers a similar kind of opportunity. We know we can't afford the system we have today, and yet there's a chance for disruptive delivery of healthcare services that focus on consumerization, and I think ultimately big brand marketing can play a role in that.</p><p>STEEL: So what kind of startups then maybe are you looking towards helping healthcare? I just don't see the correlation yet.</p><p>SCULLEY: Sure. Well, we have a healthcare system since the Second World War which is an employer-based system, meaning that there's no taxes for the employees who get the healthcare benefits which they get. With the Affordable Care Act, the president is shifting us to a mandated system, and the impact of that is that employers are starting to take on their own self-insurance.</p><p>They're going to high deductible plans, covering catastrophic health only in many cases. And this means that the first $3,000 to $5,000 every year has to be paid by the employees. They suddenly no longer have copays for that first $3,000 to $5,000.</p><p>That opens up a huge opportunity for alternative types of healthcare delivery systems like telehealth, meaning being able to have a doctor appointment online over your mobile device or over your PC, walk-in urgent care centers. There are now 9,000 of them in the US, about 25 percent penetration. So we're going to start to see real innovation I believe in the delivery of healthcare services and the ability to build brands around these services is going to be a huge focus I think for the healthcare industry.</p><p>EISEN: So this is the next it sounds like section of technology to watch. Are you talking about big tech innovation leaders like Apple?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I don't think you'll find companies like Apple going specifically into healthcare because it's such a field that requires deep knowledge of the protocols, rules, regulations of that particular industry. On the other hand, we're talking about a $2.8 trillion industry just in the United States. So the opportunity to disrupt the healthcare model is huge. And so Apple may be part of the system, but I think you're going to see other companies, even new companies, playing a more important role.</p><p>STEEL: And we don't have a lot of time on this, but this brings up the good question on should companies be innovating or should they be really putting their money into trying and make profit. Can you really do both right now in Silicon Valley?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, it depends if you have those skills. And clearly Apple has demonstrated time and again that it can do true product innovation. Other companies, particularly large public companies that have been around for a long time, set up an innovation department, usually not particularly successful.</p><p>EISEN: Well Tim Cook, the new boss who sits in your chair at Apple, recently speak to Bloomberg Businessweek of course in an interview. And he talked a lot about innovation and the (ph) chief innovation officer. He says they shouldn't have a chief innovation officer. In fact, a lot of companies have these departments and it's always a sign that something is wrong. And you have a VP of innovation or something, you know, put a for sale sign at the door because everybody there should be doing innovation. You shouldn't even have such tight (ph) officers as a title.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I think he completely nailed it. He's exactly right. Innovation is done best when you have strong product leadership. <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is obviously the best example of strong product leadership. Now Tim Cook is an outstanding CEO for Apple, but he's not the product leader. So he has to be able to empower a product leader -</p><p>EISEN: But he has a product leader.</p><p>SCULLEY: He does. Jony Ives is highly respected, very successful. Worked at Steve's right hand, and so he's got one clear product leader. Remember, he had two who were in competition with each other. He chose one, and I think it was a very good choice.</p><p>EISEN: Does Apple need a new product right now?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I just love the iPad Mini.</p><p>EISEN: Do you, really?</p><p>SCULLEY: I do, yeah. I think the iPad Mini has opportunities to get even better. I'd love - love to see the same high-resolution retina display in the iPad Mini they have on the iPad. I'd love to see the kind of keyboard accessory in the cover that even Microsoft has on the Surface. So I think the iPad Mini has got a great run. The challenge is that the gross margin on the iPad Mini is lower than Apple has had on the iPhone and the iPad.</p><p>EISEN: Well, we're going to talk a lot more about Apple and what it's got coming up.</p><p>06:20</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

And he talked a lot about innovation and the (ph) chief innovation officer. He says they shouldn't have a chief innovation officer. In fact, a lot of companies have these departments and it's always a sign that something is wrong. And you have a VP of innovation or something, you know, put a for sale sign at the door because everybody there should be doing innovation. You shouldn't even have such tight (ph) officers as a title.</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I think he completely nailed it. He's exactly right. Innovation is done best when you have strong product leadership. <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>is obviously the best example of strong product leadership. Now Tim Cook is an outstanding CEO for Apple, but he's not the product leader. So he has to be able to empower a product leader -</p><p>EISEN: But he has a product leader.</p><p>SCULLEY: He does. Jony Ives is highly respected, very successful. Worked at Steve's right hand, and so he's got one clear product leader. Remember, he had two who were in competition with each other. He chose one, and I think it was a very good choice.</p><p>EISEN: Does Apple need a new product right now?</p><p>SCULLEY: Well, I just love the iPad Mini.</p><p>EISEN: Do you, really?</p><p>SCULLEY: I do, yeah. I think the iPad Mini has opportunities to get even better. I'd love - love to see the same high-resolution retina display in the iPad Mini they have on the iPad. I'd love to see the kind of keyboard accessory in the cover that even Microsoft has on the Surface. So I think the iPad Mini has got a great run. The challenge is that the gross margin on the iPad Mini is lower than Apple has had on the iPhone and the iPad.</p><p>EISEN: Well, we're going to talk a lot more about Apple and what it's got coming up.</p><p>06:20</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 06:03 </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  SARA EISEN, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: No question the top story of the day  though has to be the fiscal cliff's lack of a deal. Bill Gross, of course  of PIMCO, bond king, tweeting out that there's only a 50 percent chance or  better probability that we're going to get some kind of fiscal cliff. Bill  Gross, always provocative in his tweets. The cliff is better than 50  percent probability, and then comes the debt ceiling, exclamation point.  Dysfunctional Washington bad for risk assets. Bad for business, it has to  be, John.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  JOHN SCULLEY, FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: Well, business  focuses on uncertainty. And obviously we're in uncertain times. This  Congress actually is still in session until January 3, and then -</p><p/><p>  EISEN: So there's hope yet.</p><p/><p>  SCULLEY: So there's still hope, but I think it's a very dysfunctional  Congress overall. We're not going to correct that in the next few months.  This is something that's going to take years to sort its way out.</p><p/><p>  ALIX STEEL, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Do you have a percentage of a fiscal cliff  probability?</p><p/><p>  SCULLEY: Well, I don't think the risk of going over the cliff is as  big as people are saying it is. The reality is if we go over the cliff,  there are mechanisms to insulate the economy from it for a period of time.  So the real test is to see what happens as we move out past the  inauguration of the president and a new Congress comes into section.</p><p/><p>  EISEN: Well, no question dysfunctional is the word of the day. We'll  talk more about this in just a moment with our White House correspondent  Hans Nichols.</p><p/><p>  06:04</p><p/><p>  (BREAK)</p><p/><p>  06:15</p><p/><p>  EISEN: How do you foster innovation and make profits at the same time?  John Sculley led Pepsi into the cola wars. He faced ups and then downs at  Apple, and he's now fostering innovation in healthcare. He joins us with a  look ahead to the state of corporate America in 2013. John, our guest host  for the hour. And tell us a little bit more about what you're investing in  now. Healthcare technology.</p><p/><p>  SCULLEY: Well Sara, when I joined the personal computer industry 30  years ago, Steve Jobs had this idea that the Macintosh wasn't just a  computer. It was a consumer appliance and it should be sold with the same  kind of big brand marketing that we used in the cola wars with Pepsi.  Thirty years later, healthcare offers a similar kind of opportunity. We  know we can't afford the system we have today, and yet there's a chance for  disruptive delivery of healthcare services that focus on consumerization,  and I think ultimately big brand marketing can play a role in that.</p><p/><p>  STEEL: So what kind of startups then maybe are you looking towards  helping healthcare? I just don't see the correlation yet.</p><p/><p>  SCULLEY: Sure. Well, we have a healthcare system since the Second  World War which is an employer-based system, meaning that there's no taxes  for the employees who get the healthcare benefits which they get. With the  Affordable Care Act, the president is shifting us to a mandated system, and  the impact of that is that employers are starting to take on their own  self-insurance. </p><p/><p> They're going to high deductible plans, covering catastrophic health only  in many cases. And this means that the first $3,000 to $5,000 every year  has to be paid by the employees. They suddenly no longer have copays for  that first $3,000 to $5,000. </p><p/><p>  That opens up a huge opportunity for alternative types of healthcare  delivery systems like telehealth, meaning being able to have a doctor  appointment online over your mobile device or over your PC, walk-in urgent  care centers. There are now 9,000 of them in the US, about 25 percent  penetration. So we're going to start to see real innovation I believe in  the delivery of healthcare services and the ability to build brands around  these services is going to be a huge focus I think for the healthcare  industry.</p><p/><p>  EISEN: So this is the next it sounds like section of technology to  watch. Are you talking about big tech innovation leaders like Apple?</p><p/><p>  SCULLEY: Well, I don't think you'll find companies like Apple going  specifically into healthcare because it's such a field that requires deep  knowledge of the protocols, rules, regulations of that particular industry.  On the other hand, we're talking about a $2.8 trillion industry just in the  United States. So the opportunity to disrupt the healthcare model is huge.  And so Apple may be part of the system, but I think you're going to see  other companies, even new companies, playing a more important role.</p><p/><p>  STEEL: And we don't have a lot of time on this, but this brings up the  good question on should companies be innovating or should they be really  putting their money into trying and make profit. Can you really do both  right now in Silicon Valley?</p><p/><p>  SCULLEY: Well, it depends if you have those skills. And clearly Apple  has demonstrated time and again that it can do true product innovation.  Other companies, particularly large public companies that have been around  for a long time, set up an innovation department, usually not particularly  successful.</p><p/><p>  EISEN: Well Tim Cook, the new boss who sits in your chair at Apple,  recently speak to Bloomberg Businessweek of course in an interview.

Hickenlooper is running as a pro-business moderate. He co-founded a brewery and eventually turned his business success into political success. He won the election to be mayor of Denver and then became a two-term governor of a purple state.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Hickenlooper's belief in market-based solutions to problems puts him at odds with some other candidates in the primary. In an interview not long after he declared his candidacy, he seemed uncertain whether to call himself a capitalist. So we started there in our conversation as part of our Opening Arguments series.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 I am a capitalist, without question. I started 20 businesses. I created a couple thousand jobs. But I was trying to say that capitalism today isn't working for a large number of Americans. Seventy-five to 80% of American families have a hard time balancing their household budgets every month. And we used to have a system when I was a kid that people would be able to get security and opportunity. Now I think people feel nothing but anxiety.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 All right. Let's talk about some specifics there. Would you support a federal minimum wage?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 Yeah, I think we have to increase the minimum wage. I'd expand the earned income tax credit. But I think one of the things we have to really look at is, why were - there are each year fewer businesses being created? And that's where job creation really comes and where quality job creation comes from.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Governor, let me have you answer your own question. Why are fewer businesses being created?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 There are a combination of reasons behind the reduction in business creation. One is that we - like any enterprise - and government is an enterprise - we've had more and more kind of red tape. And sometimes that bureaucracy is excessive and makes it harder for people - the successful employees in somebody else's company - makes it harder for them to take a leap and start their own business.             </p><p>                But I also think a big part of it is we have a consolidation of just two or three companies dominate that industry, right? There - 84% of all the hardware sales are from two companies. So starting a neighborhood hardware company is almost out of the question. People don't think they have a chance.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 The question of whether or not certain companies are monopolies has come up again and again throughout the course of this campaign. Would you break up the big tech giants - Facebook and Amazon - as Elizabeth Warren has said she would do?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 The tech companies cover a whole spectrum of businesses. And I think you'd have to go through the processes and procedures we have in place to look at, are they hurting competition, and are they negatively affecting the prices that consumers pay for their services and their goods.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Well, a lot of research has been done into it. What do you think? Do you think they are?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 I think that Amazon, in certain ways, clearly is restraining the creation of businesses. And I think that's an important filter. That's my entrepreneurial filter. I mean, Amazon is able to see which of their vendors are most successful in selling their products. And then if Amazon decides to, they can go and acquire that specific company. That seems like an unfair competitive advantage to many people.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 You said that red tape is preventing the creation of businesses. President Trump has famously made deregulation a big part of his pitch to the American people. Does President Trump have a point? Are we an overly regulated society?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 When you get rid of all the regulations, as Donald Trump is suggesting, really, we become incredibly vulnerable to what appear to be small decisions, but they become bigger decisions. We need regulation. What I was saying is we don't need red tape, right? While I was governor, we went through 24,500 rules and regulations. And we looked for the red tape that really is not adding regulatory value.             </p><p>                But at the same time we were doing that, we sat down with the oil and gas industry and the environmental community, and we created a complete, integrated system of regulations around what they call fugitive emissions, but escaping methane. We addressed that. We're the first state in the country. And they're now rolling that out as national policy in Canada. That kind of regulation, which actually protects the environment and is done efficiently, we desperately need. And Donald Trump is just getting rid of all regulation willy-nilly.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Democrats want to win back the Senate. And it's been said that if you chose to run against Republican Cory Gardner, that you would have a real shot in that race. Why go after the presidency instead of helping the Democratic Party win back the Senate?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 Well, I've spent my whole life - as a entrepreneur, as a mayor, as a governor - building teams, assembling talent. We've been able to accomplish things again and again that people didn't think we could do. We got to almost universal health care in Colorado. We did the methane regulations I described. We beat the NRA with tough new gun laws. This is all through that collaborative effort of building a team and getting things done. That's very different than the legislative process.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Has Chuck Schumer called you and urged you to run for Senate?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 (Laughter) I've talked to Chuck Schumer, who is one of the most persuasive people, and I have more admiration for how he does his job than words can express.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 You're running as a centrist, even as much of the Democratic Party is moving to the left. How do you plan to sell your ideas to an increasingly progressive party?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 Well, I talked to - obviously, I've been all over Iowa and New Hampshire. And most people really want to beat Trump. And I think if we don't stand up and say that we don't - you know, that Democrats don't stand for socialism, we're going to end up reelecting the worst president this country's ever had. And I feel sometimes a lonely voice.             </p><p>                But I think we've got to speak loud and clear that jobs matter. Our economy has to grow. And certainly we want to address income inequality. Absolutely we want to make sure that women have a right to choose, that civil rights and social justice are addressed aggressively. But we've also got to recognize to win in Ohio and Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin, we're going to have to, you know, get more to those kitchen table issues that have to do with, you know, somebody's job and - or how many jobs they're having to work just to balance their household budget.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And do you think your fellow candidates are not doing that?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 Well, they're certainly doing it to a certain extent. I'm not diminishing climate change or - as an important issue or health care. But I don't think we're going to address climate change by guaranteeing every American a federal job, which is what part of the Green New Deal was. I don't think we're going to address the spiraling inflation in health care by forcibly telling 150 million people that we're going to take away their private insurance.             </p><p>                You know, these are what a lot of Americans look at as facets or aspects of socialism. And I think we've got to be more focused and deliberate of saying repeatedly, again and again, that we want to get to address climate change, but we want to do it in a way that works.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Governor, you are a 67-year-old white man at a time when the Democratic Party says it prizes diversity. You're running against 22 other candidates. Many of them are women, people of color. Is now the time for you?             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 One of the things I've always loved about the Democratic Party is that it is a big-tent party, and it embraces opportunity for all people. And I'm running for president because I think my life experience can address this Trump-fueled national crisis of division that has been moving us backward. And I look at my experience of bringing people together - businesses and nonprofits and Republicans and Democrats - and to really get things done, to get to near-universal health care, create the No. 1 economy in the country for three consecutive years - I think that record stands for itself.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Governor John Hickenlooper, thank you so much for joining us.             </p><p>JOHN HICKENLOOPER:                 You bet, Noel. Thank you so much.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 That's former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, talking to us for our Opening Arguments series.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-201905271005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6N-23D1-JBJH-32HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 27, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
