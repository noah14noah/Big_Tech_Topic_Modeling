I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right.

Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though.

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. It's Friday. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats showing no signs of slowing down with multiple investigations into the Trump administration. Moments ago, the House Ways and Means committee issuing subpoenas to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the IRS commissioner over failure to produce President Trump's tax returns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes after the House Judiciary Committee voted this week to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt. Nancy Pelosi is praising the efforts and she's also threatening to hold Trump administration officials also in contempt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes, I agree with Chairman Nadler. Because the administration has decided that they are not going to honor their oath of office.</p><p>I'm very proud of the judiciary committee and the work that they have done. And simply of timing when we're reay we'll come to the floor. And we'll just see because there might be some other contempt of Congress issues that we want to deal with at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Adam Schiff not ruling out going after Trump officials by hitting them with stiff fines and potential jail time if they ignore subpoenas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):  They are violating the statute. We can enforce it in court but that takes time. It used to be we imprison people but we could also fine them $25,000 a day until they comply or some other number. That may be an even swifter remedy if we need to embark on it and we may have to.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  Attorney General Barr doesn't seem too worried about any of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL:  You like records. This must be a record of attorney general being proposed for contempt within 100 days of taking office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And left-wing Democrats want the party to go even further. Some now pressing Nancy Pelosi to pursue impeachment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ERIC SWALWELL (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're on the road to impeachment, there's no question about that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What I think is important is to recognize that 10 million people said that we need to hold this president accountable. I think that speaks volumes. I want to look back and said I did something. Right now, doing nothing is not an option and 10 million people just told us do something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO:  And today Jerry Nadler and other Democrats introducing the bill called the no president is above the law act. It would cause the statute of limitations so that the president could be potentially charge with the crime once he's out of office.</p><p>OK. Greg, contempt, that's the word of the week. Contempt.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST:  Contempt. Right. OK. So, what is the next -- I keep trying to figure out what is the next subway stop on this crazy train?</p><p>PERINO:  After contempt?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Have you -- yes. Well, you think about it. It is really time for responsible Democrats to stand up and say, OK, stop. Because let's look at this crazy train. The first stop was Trump was unstable.</p><p>The second stop he was insane. The third stop is Russian spy who didn't really get elected. The fourth stop was he's insane and will not leave office. That was last week, right? The fifth with fifth stop was a crisis of -- a constitutional crisis. Now we have contempt. Let's arrest everybody. What kind of message -- so what's the next? I keep thinking what is the next stop? Right.</p><p>PERINO:  Impeachment?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, impeachment but they're not going to get it. So, what are they trying to tell the public? I mean, are they taking any responsibility for the conflict. They are talking about a constitutional crisis.</p><p>What they doing is actually creating a crisis that could lead into some -- if you are trying to tell America that there is an insane unstable man barricading himself in the Oval Office what's the message that you are telling America? That somebody needs to go in and take him out.</p><p>I'm sorry, but it's getting to the point where it's getting that crazy. I hate politics. I hate the media. I don't know how I got this job.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST:  What are you doing here?</p><p>GUTFELD:  Exactly. No, that's my point. I don't know. I don't know because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Because they are paying you, that's why.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You know, because this is a circus. This is a circus born from team sport politics which is aided and abetted by a media that is -- that is invested in the same portfolio which is conflict. This is all about making money.</p><p>PERINO:  I do think the founding fathers thought that the institutions would fight against each other not that the parties would then be the ones fighting against each other and then hurting the institutions.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes. The Democrats have now just become free-wheeling sheriffs. Greg is right. This, the next stop after contempt is throw your political opponents in prison.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  That's where we are going here. Now we remember the lock him up chants and the Trump poor resentment with that. But that was just a slogan. No one ever really thought Hillary was going to prison.</p><p>Adam Schiff really wants to lock people up. Hillary is talk -- I mean, Pelosi is talking about locking people up. People are talking about holding Barr in contempt and then dragging the sergeant of arms, dragging him into jail.</p><p>We've already locked up so many people on a hoax already. This hoax got Manafort locked up, Papadopoulos locked up, Gates locked up. Now who General Flynn, a decorated hero is now waiting to serve his sentence. People salivating over the possibility that Donald Trump, Jr. might get locked up.</p><p>And James Comey last night on CNN said well maybe when the president finishes serving his term, we could charge him and then lock him up.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  It looks like now the Democrats know that Barr might throw them in jail so they are going to try to throw him in jail before they get thrown in jail. They are drunk of power; they don't trust the American people to pick their own leaders.</p><p>So, they are short-circuiting the election, which is coming up in just two years. They had ADD. They can't wait. And they're just taking it upon themselves because they care more about Twitter than about the real will of the American people.</p><p>PERINO:  But Juan, the congresswoman to leaves point that there are a lot of Democrats who said this is we want to hold the president to account and if this this, if it leads to impeachment, can Pelosi hold that back?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST &amp; POLITICAL ANALYST:  Sure. I think she has been holding it back, Dana. And what the congresswoman was referring to was a moveon.org petition. It had 10 million signatures calling for impeachment. The numbers among Democrats are pretty strong not among independents, and clearly not among Republicans.</p><p>But I would point to you that, you know, the Congress has a legitimate right to exercise oversight of the executive. And we certainly saw that with Benghazi and Fast and Furious and IRS. I mean, this is what Republicans did.</p><p>And at that time people said boy, that's kind of talk but guess what you got it play along and some people held back documents. But there wasn't a blanket refusal to cooperate which is what we're seeing now from the Trump White House.</p><p>So, to me, when you think back to Benghazi and these other things you thin, well, wait a second, what we are talking about now is a constitutional crisis in which you have the Congress versus the White House which is the very form of our democratic government. We are talking about how America works. This is bigger than Benghazi. Bigger than the IRS.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Four people died in Benghazi.</p><p>WATTERS:  Who is bigger than Benghazi?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I said this is the underpinnings of our form of government, Jesse.</p><p>PERINO:  Why, but --</p><p>GUTFELD:  Americans died.</p><p>WATTERS:  No one died.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No one -- yes. So, if we don't have a democracy, if, in other words, we have an autocrat, if the president is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  That's an exaggeration, obviously.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  -- that the president cannot --</p><p>GUTFELD:  We actually see the dead bodies.</p><p>WATTERS:  The answers to the voters, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD:  The dead bodies are there. That's merely an exaggeration.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Wait a second. We had a -- Obama was twice elected by voters. Republicans blocked him from a legitimate nomination to the Supreme Court and you didn't scream then.</p><p>This is not a supreme court nomination. They are trying to get his son in prison.</p><p>WATTERS:  This is not a Supreme Court nomination.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes.</p><p>WATTERS:  They're trying to get his son imprisoned, Juan, over a lie.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They're not trying to get anybody --</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, they are.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  They asked him to come back because guess what he said, he knew nothing about his dad --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  Adam Schiff is talking about sending people to prison.</p><p>PERINO:  Emily --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, he said that his dad -- that he knew nothing about construction of a Trump tower in Moscow.</p><p>WATTERS:  Enough, Juan. There is no collusion.</p><p>PERINO:  OK. You know, Emily, who benefits in all of this? Lawyers. Lots of lawyers.</p><p>GUTFELD:  You, Emily.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY:  We are all kept busy. Look, I agree with you. Of course, the function is oversight.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Right.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  This is so beyond oversight. This has become a rabid hunting party where all of the resources are being depleted and used solely for this one focus. This like watching a prosecutorial body just focused on one defendant and everyone else is either sleeping through cracks or being ignored.</p><p>And when Rashida Tlaib there says, you know, all these people are asking us to do something. Yes, do your job. So, these three winners right now, Nadler, Deutch, and Swalwell who just decided to, you know, introduced this bill to pause or extend the statute of limitations to essentially as you can indict a post-sitting president.</p><p>So that's what they were doing. Because I looked up all of their records. Nadler has been on the Hill literally since the dawn of man.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Literally.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  And two of his three sponsor bills was a commemorative medal and naming a building and Swalwell naming a post office. And Deutsch I don't even know but it was three bills also in the last like, 10 years.</p><p>PERINO:  Well, you actually did the research.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  But, yes. And that's what we're paying them to do. Nadler makes the highest salary on the Hill. It is such an affront to us as citizens that what they were doing -- what they are doing is chasing their tails and chasing this one person.</p><p>Because everything has to do with getting President Trump and his family, all I want them to do is their job and focus on the 10.6 million people that go to jail every year. How about those defendants? Who care about the president --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, let me just say --</p><p>PERINO:  I was going to give you the last word.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  If there's no -- if there is nothing there, why don't -- why doesn't the president, why don't his associates and say let's cooperate.</p><p>WATTERS:  They cooperated for two years for the Mueller report.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No, no.</p><p>WATTERS:  Why are you going to hand your enemy a weapon that slip your throat with, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Now we see who's the partisan is.</p><p>WATTERS:  What do you mean, Juan?</p><p>GUTFELD:  We got really good fewer male, people.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I'm talking about --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  We got to keep going. Keep going. Conservatives attacking James Comey for his latest comments. You're going to see them next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  James Comey showing up on CNN two years after getting fired by the president. He had a lot to say about President Trump, the Mueller report, and alleged spying, and more. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FORMER UNITED STATES FBI DIRECTOR:  The president is not above the law, and I don't accept the notion that because the president is the head of the executive branch, he can't ever obstruct justice.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST:  Do you think he had criminal incent based on what you have seen now in the Mueller report?</p><p>COMEY:  It sure looks like he did.</p><p>COOPER:  So, you think the Russians have leverage over President Trump?</p><p>COMEY:  I don't know the answer to that.</p><p>COOPER:  Do you think it's possible?</p><p>COMEY:  Yes. The FBI doesn't spy to begin with. The FBI investigates.</p><p>COOPER:  Then why do you think Attorney General Barr used the word spying which is obviously the word that the president has used as well?</p><p>COMEY:  I can't explain it. I mean, the only explanation I can think of is he used it because the president uses it which is really disappointing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO:  President Trump unloading on Comey, calling him a disgrace to the FBI and its worst director in history.</p><p>All right. So, Jesse, I'll start with you.</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Comey also said that A.G. Barr lost most of his reputation because of how he's -- how he conducted himself. Is that the pot calling the kettle black?</p><p>WATTERS:  Yes, Comey is not a hero. He is a small -- well, very tall, but pathetic man that really screwed things up. If you think about it, he investigated both presidential candidates, botched both investigations. He got fired, his deputy got fired. His chief investigator got fired.</p><p>Then he leaked to trigger a special counsel investigation that found no evidence of the conspiracy which he had pushed and it tore the whole country apart. Can we remind Democrats how much they hate James Comey?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Right.</p><p>WATTERS:  He came up and held a press conference after not charging Hillary and then just slandered her. Totally broke a protocol. And then a week before the election pulled out Weiner's laptop. A lot of Democrats blame him for her loss.</p><p>So, at this point you have Comey now polluting two elections, 2016 and the midterms, and possibly a third in 2020. Because if you think about it if Barr goes back and investigates how this whole thing was predicated whether this was politically motivated and whether the rules were broken and they find out they were, who suffers?</p><p>If Biden is the nominee, this happened on his watch. He's going to have to answer for that? How is he going to play? Is he going to say, well, I didn't really know about it? Then he just looks like a potted plant. Or if he says, you know, Comey was doing the right thing, then he looks like a collusion truther.</p><p>So -- and if you look at the ratings, totally lost his muscle. Tucker beat him by almost double. And his rating from this town hall was much less than it was his first CNN poll.</p><p>He is like Avenatti. They are just using him and they are going to toss him to the curb.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  So, Juan, given all of that, and yet, Comey did also say in that interview that he is going to canvass for 2020 Democrats --</p><p>PERINO:  Wow.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  -- is he just going to gut the party even more he got another election? Will it help or hurt them?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Hurt help -- the Democrats?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Or the -- yes, the Democrats if --</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I don't -- I think Jesse is right about it. I don't think Comey is a hero to Democrats given to what he did to Hillary Clinton and hid the fact that they had an on-going investigation into Russian interference in the campaign, specifically their ties to the Trump campaign.</p><p>But I think Jesse is wrong when he says and he got fired. He didn't get fired. He was thrown out by President Trump and people argue whether or not that was part of Trump's effort to obstruct or interfere with the Mueller investigation. But my --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  And Mueller said that there is no obstruction.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But my feeling is this, that when you hear him respond to Bill Barr on the spying thing, you're not just hearing Jim Comey. You're hearing a lot of people, FBI, the intelligence community, including Christopher Wray, the Republican current head of the FBI who says he doesn't know of any evidence of any spying by the FBI.</p><p>There's just nothing like this. And you worry that in fact, as Comey said in that interview, Bill Barr has simply become the president's lawyer as opposed to the attorney general of the United States.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Dana, I want to get your prediction for what you think is going to happen to Comey. Like, what, literally what is going to his future?</p><p>PERINO:  A prediction?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>PERINO:  I don't know. I was thinking about the choice. Everybody gets a choice on how they want to conduct their life and how they want to deal with their public service after they retire or force retirement or firing.</p><p>So, you think about James Comey. He's not liked by either side, really. But then the Democrats were sort of like, well, maybe we could like him a little bit if he could hurt President Trump.</p><p>Meantime, you've got somebody like Mueller who was in retirement, comes out of retirement to do this. Nobody could pick -- nobody knows what his voice sounds like. He doesn't do any press. He's like he doesn't want to do that.</p><p>And it's a really interesting thing about a decision that you make. In some ways, Comey is a little bit like the Giuliani legal team. Which was that you stay on offense, stay in front. Stay in front of the camera. Always be hitting, and always be trying to score points, always try to get in front of the story so that you can deflect attention about yourself.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Greg, what are your thoughts on Mr. Comey --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD:  Well, as you probably know, I don't like tall people. And you can clearly see from that show him sitting down, he is still taller than me.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Definitely.</p><p>GUTFELD:  OK. Forget Comey. Let's focus on CNN. Do you know what CNN is? Remember in a high school let's say a friend of yours got dumped and that your friend immediately hooks up with someone new to parade that new hook up in front of the ex that dump him, that's CNN with Comey, right?</p><p>Because you know, they are just using him, as you say, to get back at Trump because Trump kind of dumped him. Remember with CNN and MSNBC that really helped elect Trump, you know, it was -- it wasn't -- we had plenty to choose from in the field.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD:  But they focused on Trump. So, Trump dumps him. So now they're like, CNN is walking around with Comey. Hey, check me out. Look who is here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  It's good analogy, Greg. I got to tip my --</p><p>GUTFELD:  You like it.</p><p>WATTERS:  I like it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  And it fits the profit motive for CNN which is all about conflict. All of the stories at CNN if you think about it in the last like five or six years are about conflict. If you think about their police brutality narratives and the racism and the hate crimes, these are all designed to separate us. So, this fits perfectly with CNN's profit motive.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  Nice.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Anyway, and he is tall too. And I don't like tall people.</p><p>WATTERS:  Can I address something that Juan said. I hate to do this, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No.</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at so many --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  I'm pretty --</p><p>WATTERS:  That's why I love to do it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  We don't have enough time for --</p><p>WATTERS:  If you look at someone's phone calls and e-mails.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes, sir.</p><p>WATTERS:  And if you send undercover agents to someone and if you use overseas agents against someone, and if you unmask people and tried to get into their business, I think most people think that's spying. You can call it an investigation. But real people when they talk, they call that spying.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  No. So, I guess now Christopher Wray, the FBI director, he's some left-wing loon in your opinion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  No. I just think he had difference with the way he characterizes it.</p><p>GUTFELD:  Finally, Juan, you're speaking the truth.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  I just think that -- no. I just think that if you have Russia interfering in our election and our prime domestic organization for criminal investigation, the FBI, fail to do anything. Jesse, you and I could join hands and say that's outrageous. They are doing their job.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS:  We will never join hands Juan. We will never do that.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, because, I know him.</p><p>PERINO:  Come on, join hands.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  There you go.</p><p>PERINO:  Everybody.</p><p>COMPAGNO:  All right, you guys. Are scandal-plagued social media companies too powerful? The latest example next. Stick with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  A co-founder of Facebook is blasting CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling Zuckerberg's power unprecedented and un-American. Chris Hughes explains why he's urging the government to step in and break up the social media giant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HUGHES, CO-FOUNDER, FACEBOOK:  The Facebook that exist today is not the Facebook that we founded in 2004. And the one that we have today I think it's far too big, it's far too powerful, and most importantly, its CEO Mark Zuckerberg is not accountable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Facebook is pushing back. They're rejecting Hughes' proposal as completely out of touch.</p><p>With numerous scandals brewing including censorship, privacy, social media mobs, and election interference. Do big tech companies have too much power or is this going too far? Emily, what do you think, too much power for one company?</p><p>COMPAGNO:  You could argue that. I think what's so interesting about their little tiff is that each are arguing for intervention by the government. So, Zuckerberg's answer was we're going to create internet rules. That's the only way to kind of, have everyone get on board. And it's me working with elected officials to do so to create this system and then which we will adhere to, but made a sense grammatically.</p><p>But then the other guy, that his roommate was the one that was like, and the government needs to break it up. So, I just think it's interesting that given Zuckerberg's kind of position this whole time where it's incumbent upon him the social responsibility and all the responsibly in his shoulders. Why doesn't he just do it himself?</p><p>Quick second there, he points, it's not quite a monopoly if it's an elective situation and there's no stifling of introduction of competing things. Meaning anyone can create a similar platform. It's not Facebook's fault if they are better than them. And you could argue in the (Inaudible) then that's when the DOJ steps in and breaks it up.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  But I think that, in fact, others have tried but Facebook dominating and really has been quite the successful competitor. But the -- so the question then is, what's to be done? And Zuckerberg says they are looking at encrypted very private types of communications but that hasn't put in. Is that a solution for you, Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS:  He would know. I have no idea. But here's what happened, Juan. Obama used Facebook to get elected, then Trump uses Facebook to get elected. And then the Democrats get upset because Hillary loses and then blame Facebook for Hillary losing.</p><p>The Russian bots, the fake news. And so, they bring up Zuckerberg to testify and they say you better start regulating Facebook. So, what is -- what do they want him to do? They want him to get rid of fake news, AKA, news the mainstream media doesn't like, and they want him to ban conservatives.</p><p>So, he starts doing that. And then conservatives start hating Facebook. So, this one anything gets done in Washington is when liberals hate something and conservatives hate something. So, Liz Warren gets together with Ted Cruz and they wanted too anti-trust action.</p><p>But here's what he's going to do. He is just going to shower these senators with so much cash, he's going to hire a bunch of lobbyists, probably six of them and they are going to send the right money to the right people. He's probably built some satellite offices in the right districts to help these guys out --</p><p>PERINO:  Kentucky?</p><p>WATTERS:  Kentucky always a great location. Just to buy time until Congress loses its focus and starts fighting another enemy.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  All right.</p><p>PERINO:  By the way, I would put an office in Kentucky.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Yes. Yes. Mitch would appreciate that. Dana, when you think about some of the realities of Facebook, social media mobs on top of election interference. I mean, you know, things like Rohingya Muslims being killed.</p><p>PERINO:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  As a result of, you know, kind of hate being fed to them on Facebook.</p><p>PERINO:  Here's the thing about that. So, I'm skeptical of the government being able to help. I'm skeptical of breaking up Facebook and creating like a 1,000 other Facebooks and then expecting that to help?</p><p>The fact that human nature is what it is. And the autocratic governments like in Myanmar or Burma doesn't -- basically they have no media. So the government uses Facebook in order to disseminate information. And then Facebook is expected to hire enough translators to speak every dialect in that country in order to police it.</p><p>I don't see how -- I understand there is a problem. I don't understand how the government is to help. And to Chris Hughes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Well, hang on, hang on.</p><p>PERINO:  Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Let's go back to that. Because China has been very aggressive and we, as Americans find it offensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO:  Well, first of all, China does not allow Facebook in.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, no, but they allow other apps and they control them.</p><p>PERINO: Exactly, I'm not for that either.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I was asking. So I mean in fact they do -- you know--</p><p>PERINO: No, they're controlling people like, we don't do that here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No--</p><p>PERINO: And also Facebook is an American company. We just stand up -- what if we -- what about -- what about standing up for an American company.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And also Chris Hughes, he's a billionaire because of Facebook.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: He admits that. Right? OK. He's like, but I really wish that I hadn't. But also think about the politics. His husband is a Sean Eldridge. He did not win his election in 2014. I smell a political comeback. Because what could -- what is the safest thing to do right now if you are running to run for office and you want to get money from a liberal base?</p><p>Because you pay no price for being against the tech companies, because now you can -- tobacco's done -- pharma -- everybody is against pharma now. Bangs is kind of like over with -- Elizabeth Warren locked that up. But you can go after a big tech and you pay no price for that.</p><p>WATTERS: You can actually get money, because then they'll start donating--</p><p>GUTFELD: Silicon Valley is--</p><p>PERINO: The six lobbyists.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute -- (CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: --is the new Wall Street. Everybody hates it.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Greg, we live in a situation where some people may say, you know what, Facebook's too big to fail. It's just so huge, but I wanted to ask you, just like I asked Dana about the social media mobs -- about -- I mean right now there's -- you can still go on there and you find violence -- screaming violence, incidents of violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Violence is everywhere. It's -- I wonder how many marriages have been broken up by Facebook, maybe it's time to break them up too. Anyway, I agree with Dana you just break them up into one and you think one monster and turn it into a 100 little monsters.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, do we get to keep our followers?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know. Do we have all independent Facebooks?</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Here's it, but I also have to go back to what you were saying, because this was my original talking point, which you kind of stole, but that's OK.</p><p>PERINO: I actually just had the same thought.</p><p>GUTFELD: I know, I know, sometimes we share thoughts. I questioned the source of the person being interviewed. The media will often take any narrative, like we did Comey, as long as it fits their context, right? There they were looking for an angle, find the jilted person in this story.</p><p>So something went down between him and Zuckerberg that didn't that didn't go right, so this guy is a score to settle, so he goes on, so Comey has a score to settle, ex pornstars have scores to settle, Tom Arnold has scores to settle. Everybody who hates Trump has a score to settle, so they just go on. And they should actually present the context why is this guy so pissed off.</p><p>WATTERS: They probably didn't even ask.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they didn't did that. I hate that network.</p><p>PERINO: Well, he is made because of the civility -- lack of civility.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think everybody knows who Mr. Hughes is, the question is about Facebook and social media in our age, that's a big question.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big update too is coming one on our favorite Russian spy whale and an intense bear brawl, you got to see this caught on tape. In addition, a special Friday surprise from THE FIVE. You won't want to miss any of it. It's all up next in the \"Fastest 7\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WATTERS: Welcome back time for the \"Fastest 7\". First up. Our favorite suspected Russian whale is back and better than before. He's a spy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Check out this amazing video of the beluga, that's still hanging off the coast of Norway. The friendly whale showing off its talents by helping a woman get back her phone that she dropped in the water. THE FIVE is all over this story.</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't think people understand what -- that's an amazing video, because you can see the whale coming up, holding the phone. I thought this was completely doctored. We have to offer this whale asylum immediately. Get him over here, get a White House -- right in front.</p><p>I mean, this -- and look how happy -- the funny thing is that's a fake smile.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's -- spies learn that.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, what I want to issue a apology. I said the whale was like some pet. I think this thing's well trained.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, that's a spy.</p><p>WATTERS: I think this thing is a spy whale, I stand corrected, probably the only fellow who is still wrong on the show.</p><p>PERINO: I love the whale. I think it's great. And also the thing is he's so nice, even though -- like, if people take your picture in the street, if they drop your phone, do you help them pick it up?</p><p>WATTERS: No. But my phone?</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you would -- no like if they're taking a picture and they drop their phone. It's like oh let me help you with that.</p><p>WATTERS: Of course, yes.</p><p>PERINO: That's kind.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, it's a very nice whale.</p><p>GUTFELD: I wonder if he took a picture of himself before he handed it back. So he get back and said, wholly crap--</p><p>PERINO: Or also, maybe he have downloaded the entire phone into his brain and is already given it to the Russian.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right, that's the spying, we've been talking about Williams.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I can't do this straight. I love baby beluga. I love all that. But I kind of think is this James Bond, is this like get smart, because that guy is hanging around. He's up to something Jesse. I don't know what it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you think there is spy inside the whale, that's got -- the computer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I really appreciate that it could get THE FIVE to say yes to asylum. That was a -- that's a real triumph.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Yes, I like asylum.</p><p>WATTERS: What do you think Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Just that he's the cutest thing in the world. I just love him so much, and he reminds me of this guy Popeye, which is that one-eyed seal in Friday Harbor in Washington and everyone would come and see him and feed him until he bit someone. But he was like--</p><p>GUTFELD: Until he bit someone -- then they shot him.</p><p>WATTERS: Not well trained.</p><p>PERINO: This is why you're not supposed to feed them.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Totally, yes. And he was my screensaver on my phone for a long time. But -- oh, I wanted to say that. I want that -- I want somebody to vet this sanctuary--</p><p>WATTERS: Throw me everything--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --that they're bringing in. No, that they're in this beluga too. I want somebody to vet the sanctuary and tell me that he'll have friends there. You guys he's going to a sanctuary in Iceland. So we need to make sure that it's a comfortable happy place for him--</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, you speak like he bit your hand</p><p>WATTERS: Let's move on guys. We've done enough -- up next, imagine looking out your window and seeing this going down in the front yard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Look at the size of that. (bleep) Get ready, he's getting in house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right in our front yard.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Holy (bleep)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Get ready, come in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So one of the guys, of course, he is from Jersey, was recording this and he thinks it was two male black bears fighting over a female, isn't that always what it's about.</p><p>GUTFELD: I saw the same thing last night two bears fighting, but it was in \"The Village\". You know, it looked that that's Alec and Steve Baldwin fighting politics -- two big hairy guys from Long Island.</p><p>PERINO: It's -- they're modern bears. They used to -- men used to fight over women and now they just fight over Wi-Fi.</p><p>WATTERS: Corny jokes in the \"Fastest\", I like it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what to make of that. I mean are they really fighting, are they dancing. Is it some kind of ritual? I don't know what's going on. But where's the female, by the way? Wouldn't the female be--</p><p>GUTFELD: --get out of your gender roles, Juan, maybe they want to be together. They're men.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, that's right. Maybe they were bears.</p><p>GUTFELD: They're bears.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Maybe, you saw them in \"The Village\", not in -- Chelsea (ph).</p><p>WATTERS: Men always fight over a woman.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Well, that's like my dream to look out the window and see that. I mean that's amazing. I also feel like given how big -- no, I just like wild animals. I feel like they are fighting pretty -- like--</p><p>PERINO: They are vicious.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. Like they're kind of doing that--</p><p>PERINO: Also, Emily, we don't see those either--</p><p>WATTERS: --the whole thing we're not going to feed. All right. This is finally -- this is the best part of the show. They have a new Snapchat filter that makes users look like a baby, so we use it on ourselves. Here I am. Adorable. I look the same.</p><p>PERINO: Big hair.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Did you look like that as a baby?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I did.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hideous.</p><p>WATTERS: Great complexion. Everybody wants to cuddle me. Here's Dana Perino.</p><p>PERINO: It's like--</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: No difference.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>WATTERS: You are like spanners right there. Wow, so precious. Here is Juan. Well, what happened to your head?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's nothing wrong here.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think I need more hair. Oh, my God, need more hair.</p><p>WATTERS: But you're so cute Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: We get to stick pacifier in your mouth. And there -- you look the same. Yes, exactly the same.</p><p>COMPAGNO: My face is not that fat normally, look at those cheeks. It's creepy. I think that's a creepy photo.</p><p>WATTERS: No, that's fine and baby Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: We didn't see this one.</p><p>WATTERS: Drop the banner, he is too short. Oh, boy.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Oh, my God. You look like Beetlejuice.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Tiny head--</p><p>GUTFELD: But this race -- OK. This raises an interesting question. What if you say that that child is ugly, it's ugly. It is that bullying, if that child doesn't exist?</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: Like if we make fun of that -- no, but actually it is.</p><p>WATTERS: Put Greg back up. We put Greg back.</p><p>GUTFELD: If you're making fun -- I'm that baby could be -- I have a sneaking suspicion there just using somebody else's body and putting--</p><p>WATTERS: There he is.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It looks like he's got a--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: Pretty eye lashes, Greg.</p><p>COMPAGNO: He doesn't have teeth.</p><p>GUTFELD: See what I mean? Now, is this is bullying? They're bullying a child version of me. So is that weird?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, no.</p><p>GUTFELD: That kid doesn't exist or does he?</p><p>WATTERS: It's like throwing Trump in jail for the hoax that never happened.</p><p>GUTFELD: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Perfect analogy.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bring it back to Trump.</p><p>WATTERS: Always. All right. We got a filter that changes us into women or women into men--</p><p>GUTFELD: They wouldn't let us use it.</p><p>WATTERS: It's too controversial. We were worried about Greg would say.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, me.</p><p>WATTERS: \"Fan Mail Friday\" is up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, we're surfing music. All right, first question. What is the strangest place for -- for Fan Mail Friday that is. \"What is the strangest place you've ever awaken to after a night out?\" Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My own.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is strange?</p><p>GUTFELD: So why is that strange?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Because there is no strange. Please I've ever looking--</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clarification. Oh Jesse.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm a good girl.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. Well, I mean I hate to admit this. I did wake up on the sidewalk one time. Someone kicked me and said wake up and it was like 5:00 a.m. I hopped up, got in the cab and went home.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>GUTFELD: O'Reilly (ph) was always helpful. Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: When I was in high school -- this is prom season. So I went to prom and we were having a wild party, and I woke up in a barn.</p><p>GUTFELD: In a barn?</p><p>WILLIAMS: A barn. And it's not clear to me exactly why I was in the barn. But I was in the barn and so -- I mean, it's -- as you can see--</p><p>COMPAGNO: Wow, the mind boggles.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm a city kid, so that's--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: --in the haystack, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's how he learned the shovel maneuver. All right, Dana, with best for last.</p><p>PERINO: I think, I'm going to say El Paso. Remember, the flight?</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, yes. Yes, she stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: No, I didn't.</p><p>GUTFELD: She stole the plane.</p><p>PERINO: I woke up in a plane.</p><p>WATTERS: The legend--</p><p>GUTFELD: I woke up in a flower patch in Chicago. I lost my friends, we were out drinking and I went to sleep in somebody's flower patch in Chicago.</p><p>WATTERS: Comfortable?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And I wasn't that young. It was last week.</p><p>Question from Sally, oh great question. \"Do any of you write -- or let's say I've written poetry.\" How about that? Poetry Dana? You seem the type.</p><p>PERINO: I am an excellent haiku writer.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's not poetry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, it is.</p><p>PERINO: Excuse me--</p><p>GUTFELD: It doesn't rhyme. It's like playing tennis without a net.</p><p>PERINO: Disagree.</p><p>WATTERS: I got hammered one night in high school and wrote some poetry and it actually got published in the school journal.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, wow.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe she got so mad.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know, she wasn't. She was valedictorian, though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I bet you write poetry?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No I used to when I was in college high school I wrote poetry. But not now. Now I write nonfiction.</p><p>WATTERS: I call it fiction.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You call it fake news.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I won a poetry contest in seventh grade -- like accidentally. You all had to submit a poem like it was part of our class or whatever and then and I won.</p><p>PERINO: You remember it?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. I wrote -- it was like diversity -- oh no, I don't--</p><p>WATTERS: It was about diversity?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. It was basically about -- is -- this is too cheesy. But anyway, the funniest part is that--</p><p>WATTERS: Roses are red--</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, no--</p><p>GUTFELD: It was very fast roses are red, violets are blue -- whatever--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --son of the science teacher ended up being a prosecutor on the other side of a case like yours later, which is kind of funny.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is a funny story.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, totally.</p><p>GUTFELD: I write poetry every day here on THE FIVE, it's called my monologues. Actually every guy wrote a poem for a girl, because--</p><p>PERINO: They don't rhyme either.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, they're terrible -- I mean the poems. Murray, writes \"What wild animal would you love to pet if you could do so safely?\" Your hands are already up.</p><p>COMPAGNO: God, I mean, just every big cat, everything furry, fuzzy -- a wolf, obviously a wolf.</p><p>GUTFELD: A wolf, obviously, Juan a wolf.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Big cats -- cheetahs, jaguars. I mean -- but the thing is, I -- if you touch something like a pig, you realize that's bristly.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's gross. Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, its gross.</p><p>WATTERS: --was touching pigs all day. You--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: He is knee deep in slime.</p><p>PERINO: That's the daily briefing.</p><p>WATTERS: I petted Tasmanian devil.</p><p>GUTFELD: Really.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you real?</p><p>GUTFELD: I believe.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're small.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a koala bear.</p><p>GUTFELD: Apparently they're not nice. They're very snooty.</p><p>PERINO: I want to pet a nice.</p><p>GUTFELD: They are very snooty. The more adorable -- I want -- I did pet a wallaby.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh, cool.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that interesting?</p><p>PERINO: Would you want to pet a sloth?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would love a sloth. They have a sticky stuff at the end of their fingers and I think it can kill you. But they're so adorable.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But you know what once I was in China and I got to go where they breed pandas. They took me behind the scenes and I got to pet pandas. And again, it's not soft--</p><p>PERINO: Yes, stink. They have too much--</p><p>GUTFELD: They don't even like -- we don't have anything fun to pet human beings. We don't have any fur.</p><p>Last question, \"If you had to be an inanimate object for a year what would it be?\" Jesse--</p><p>WATTERS: I would--</p><p>GUTFELD: Not you.</p><p>WATTERS: OK. I'm going to change my answer. I would be something in your house, so I could just listen to you go crazy all night long.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, like his Alexa.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I would be my '72 Mach 1.</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You'd be a car.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'd be the car. I'd be my car.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's tough. I don't know, maybe I'd like to be a skyscraper.</p><p>WATTERS: Trump Tower?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I'm out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Americans inside you every day.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, there you go.</p><p>PERINO: Fighter jet.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's good. Fighter jet, that's great. That's good. I want to be fighter jet. No I think I'd be a bridge. I'll just be a bridge.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, god, yes -- across humanity.</p><p>GUTFELD: Then you always have -- you'll have people on your back, feel pretty good, right?</p><p>WATTERS: You'd be better as the wall.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I would be the wall. That's a better answer. Dammit it, should have thought about it. \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\", Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Happy National Shrimp Day, everybody including Dana and Greg.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Shell fish and they're disgusted by the smell of it. But I think it's delicious, and it's a healthy food option.</p><p>GUTFELD: Not the shrimp--</p><p>WATTERS: This is shrimp Del Frisco's delivered by Sofia and Eleana (ph) Watters. Thank you girls very much. Also Watters World 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we have Lara Trump, also we have a psychedelic guru to discuss the decriminalization of magic mushrooms in Denver. Take your pick.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. So before I get started, I wanted to say Happy Mother's Day to all the moms in my life past and present and all you moms out there, we love you. And I want to say, moms don't do this. Take a look at this video if you will.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two women trying to take pictures on jagged rocks on a Hawaiian island. As you see they survived the first wave, but the second wave, that's a different story. Watch this.</p><p>All right happy to say that women were not injured. But their cameras -- cameras didn't fare as well.</p><p>WATTERS: Maybe the whale can find it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: By the way, here the kicker to this story. After all that when they got back to their car, they had a ticket, it had been parked illegally. This was no day at the beach folks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: I want to congratulate Holley Vega, she has been named the 2019 Armed Forces Insurance Military Spouse of the Year, recognized for her outstanding commitment to the military community and volunteer work with the American Heart Association and the L.I.N.K.S. program.</p><p>She's been a marine spouse for 18 years, experienced 10 changes of station at six different bases and three deployments. This year's honor saw more than 1,200 nominations and a national selection process yielding more than 100,000 votes. So congratulations to Holly. Holly's husband is Lieutenant Colonel Javier Vega and they have three children. They are amazing.</p><p>WATTERS: Nice.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. The Greg Gutfeld Show tomorrow at 10 o'clock got some great guests. Somebody named Emily Compagno, got the comedian Kris Fried, Emily Compagno and Kat Timpf and Tyrus and Emily Compagno. Now that's tomorrow night, you better watch it at 10 p.m.</p><p>Time for this. \"Greg's Lou Dobbs\". We haven't done \"Lou Dobbs News\" in a while. He got a new car -- got a new car. Let's take a look at it.</p><p>(VIDEO PLAYING)</p><p>GUTFELD: It's a brand new Bentley that actually has a giant tank treads we're -- they're having it delivered to Lou Dobbs' his house from a Russian mechanic. Yes, so this is what -- how Lou Dobbs gets to work now. Just rolls over and -- just other cars. It's pretty amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why a Russian mechanic?</p><p>GUTFELD: I don't know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They do good work, Juan.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly. Now Russians are like the new bad people.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, you have an entire minute to do your \"One More Thing\".</p><p>WATTERS: But still speak at the same speed.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could do the whole show.</p><p>COMPAGNO: This is a good one seriously. When we all get fired from Fox, this is going to be our next job here. For $93,000 a year you can be a luxury yacht tester, you guys. So apparently there's this site and it's called hush-hush.</p><p>And it's the luxury Amazon essentially, and these guys need someone to live on all these different yachts and you make $2,000 a week and you live, eat sleep on the yacht and you review up to 50 a year. You don't need any--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're going to hate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: --experience required. So see you guys in a year.</p><p>GUTFELD: No, when the job is that good, you end up hating the job. Like, \"Oh, I want to be a beer taster or a -- \"</p><p>PERINO: And that they are having to advertise for someone to do this job--</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: --tells you that it's not a good job.</p><p>GUTFELD: --it's a scam. They kidnap you. They have you come on there and it's a sex slave ship. It's a sex slave ship.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You turned a nice job into a horrible show.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think you would be pretty lonely, because you can't happen to -- you switch ships--</p><p>PERINO: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Pilot ship that's what it is.</p><p>PERINO: That's it for us, are you glad? We'll see you back here on Monday, though. Have a great weekend, everybody from THE FIVE.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2224437357</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D16H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That's a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year - period.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Moody's%20Report%20on%20American%20Housing%20and%20Economic%20Mobility%20Act1.pdf\">Moody's</url> found would create more than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10 percent. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p>\"The solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\" said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \"I suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, the party's most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich. Warren would expand the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1 percent of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25 percent house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2 percent tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p>Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won't go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built. Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p>Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers - federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent. And Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Klobuchar would expand tax credits that encourage developers to build affordable housing.</p><p>In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3 percent or 1.5 times the rate of inflation - more stringent than a similar California law passed last year - even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/economic-inequality/national-rent-control-cap/\">None</url> of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p>But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg and Sanders have endorsed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/2020-elections-pete-buttigieg-housing-plan-hypervacancy/594298/\">program</url> in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \"homesteader\" would fully own the property.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs. And Warren would <url normalizedValue=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/disability-rights-and-equality\">deny federal grants</url> to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p>All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p>Fighting wildfires</p><p>All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some also have focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires - many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p>The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state because 57 percent of California forests are owned and managed by the feds. Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts, instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p>\"Historically it has been state and local governments working in these areas - but with the size of the problem we're facing, this is clearly a federal issue too,\" Pimlott said.</p><p>Steyer - the only Californian still in the race - has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \"serve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don't address the climate crisis immediately,\" Steyer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tomsteyer.com/press/tom-steyer-on-the-saddleridge-brush-fire-in-southern-california/\">said</url>.</p><p>Bloomberg has come out with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/policies/wildfire-resilience\">most specific plan</url>, calling for doubling federal funding to $10 billion to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase FEMA funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p>Sanders is the only candidate who's called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv9-qowZxfQ\">online video ad</url> released last week.</p><p>Warren, Bloomberg, and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/12/why-fremont-firefighters-could-focus-on-saving-lives-not-the-pge-shutdown/\">microgrid technology</url> - energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid - which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year's fire season.</p><p>Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires. Bloomberg calls for a \"Wildfire Corps,\" a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a \"Civilian Climate Corps.\"</p><p>Trump has urged California to improve its forest management - memorably, calling for the state to \"rake\" its forests - and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he's done little to change the federal government's approach to wildfires.</p><p>Regulating Big Tech companies</p><p>The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they're divided on what to do about it.</p><p>Two contenders - Warren and Sanders - have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley. Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms, like Amazon selling its own products that compete with other vendors using its site.</p><p>That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \"bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\" Warren argues <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">in her plan</url>.</p><p>The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they'd be open to breaking up companies in some cases - but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p>Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \"not politics,\" decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">said</url> Warren and Sanders don't \"know what they're talking about\" on the issue, although he'd be open to some more limited breakups. And Klobuchar said in an interview she favored a broader revamp of U.S. antitrust laws that went beyond a \"bumper sticker solution.\"</p><p>Several candidates have also called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/warren-proposes-criminal-penalties-for-spreading-disinformation-online.html\">proposed</url> \"tough civil and criminal penalties\" for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p>Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, social media companies aren't legally responsible for content their users post. Biden has called for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/biden-wants-to-get-rid-of-techs-legal-shield-section-230.html\">repealing that law</url>, which would lead to a massive shift in tech policy, while Bloomberg has  he wants to amend it.</p><p>And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics. Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested  that exploit user data.</p><p>What about Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anticompetitive policies.</p><p>Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p>All of the candidates have opposed Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there's been far less conversation\u00a0about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p>Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas - the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S., and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p>Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas - a limit that's reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2013/01/klobuchar-looks-increase-visas-part-immigration-reform/\">introduced legislation</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">suggested</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257617/amy-klobuchar-user-data-sales-tax-google-amazon-facebook\">taxing companies</url> in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p>They would all pair those increases with reforms to the system such as mandating higher wages to ensure U.S. workers aren't displaced. Bloomberg is also proposing a \"startup visa\" for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p>\"Whether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\" the former mayor <url normalizedValue=\"https://content.mikebloomberg.com/Immigration+Policy.pdf\">says</url> in his plan.</p><p>Sanders' campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \"so workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\" He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren't replacing American workers.</p><p>In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they'd allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work - a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/20/h-1b-visa-rule-to-ban-h-1b-spouses-from-working-coming-in-march-homeland-security-says/\">direct contrast</url> with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses' work authorization.</p><p>Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They'd also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p>That's a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p>\"We need a system that's dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that's been set in statute for decades,\" she said. \"The process should be a lot more thoughtful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That's a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year - period.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Moody's%20Report%20on%20American%20Housing%20and%20Economic%20Mobility%20Act1.pdf\">Moody's</url> found would create more than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10 percent. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p>\"The solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\" said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \"I suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\"</p><p>Not surprisingly, the party's most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich. Warren would expand the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1 percent of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25 percent house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2 percent tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p>Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won't go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built. Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p>Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers - federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent. And Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Klobuchar would expand tax credits that encourage developers to build affordable housing.</p><p>In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3 percent or 1.5 times the rate of inflation - more stringent than a similar California law passed last year - even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/economic-inequality/national-rent-control-cap/\">None</url> of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p>But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg and Sanders have endorsed a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/07/2020-elections-pete-buttigieg-housing-plan-hypervacancy/594298/\">program</url> in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \"homesteader\" would fully own the property.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs. And Warren would <url normalizedValue=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/disability-rights-and-equality\">deny federal grants</url> to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p>All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p>Fighting wildfires</p><p>All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some also have focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires - many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p>The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state because 57 percent of California forests are owned and managed by the feds. Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts, instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p>\"Historically it has been state and local governments working in these areas - but with the size of the problem we're facing, this is clearly a federal issue too,\" Pimlott said.</p><p>Steyer - the only Californian still in the race - has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \"serve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don't address the climate crisis immediately,\" Steyer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tomsteyer.com/press/tom-steyer-on-the-saddleridge-brush-fire-in-southern-california/\">said</url>.</p><p>Bloomberg has come out with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mikebloomberg.com/policies/wildfire-resilience\">most specific plan</url>, calling for doubling federal funding to $10 billion to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase FEMA funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p>Sanders is the only candidate who's called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv9-qowZxfQ\">online video ad</url> released last week.</p><p>Warren, Bloomberg, and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/12/why-fremont-firefighters-could-focus-on-saving-lives-not-the-pge-shutdown/\">microgrid technology</url> - energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid - which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year's fire season.</p><p>Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires. Bloomberg calls for a \"Wildfire Corps,\" a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a \"Civilian Climate Corps.\"</p><p>Trump has urged California to improve its forest management - memorably, calling for the state to \"rake\" its forests - and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he's done little to change the federal government's approach to wildfires.</p><p>Regulating Big Tech companies</p><p>The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they're divided on what to do about it.</p><p>Two contenders - Warren and Sanders - have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley. Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms, like Amazon selling its own products that compete with other vendors using its site.</p><p>That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \"bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\" Warren argues <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">in her plan</url>.</p><p>The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they'd be open to breaking up companies in some cases - but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p>Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \"not politics,\" decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">said</url> Warren and Sanders don't \"know what they're talking about\" on the issue, although he'd be open to some more limited breakups. And Klobuchar said in an interview she favored a broader revamp of U.S. antitrust laws that went beyond a \"bumper sticker solution.\"</p><p>Several candidates have also called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/29/warren-proposes-criminal-penalties-for-spreading-disinformation-online.html\">proposed</url> \"tough civil and criminal penalties\" for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p>Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, social media companies aren't legally responsible for content their users post. Biden has called for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/17/biden-wants-to-get-rid-of-techs-legal-shield-section-230.html\">repealing that law</url>, which would lead to a massive shift in tech policy, while Bloomberg has  he wants to amend it.</p><p>And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics. Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested  that exploit user data.</p><p>What about Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anticompetitive policies.</p><p>Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p>All of the candidates have opposed Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there's been far less conversation\u00a0about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p>Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas - the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S., and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p>Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas - a limit that's reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2013/01/klobuchar-looks-increase-visas-part-immigration-reform/\">introduced legislation</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">suggested</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257617/amy-klobuchar-user-data-sales-tax-google-amazon-facebook\">taxing companies</url> in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p>They would all pair those increases with reforms to the system such as mandating higher wages to ensure U.S. workers aren't displaced. Bloomberg is also proposing a \"startup visa\" for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p>\"Whether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\" the former mayor <url normalizedValue=\"https://content.mikebloomberg.com/Immigration+Policy.pdf\">says</url> in his plan.</p><p>Sanders' campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \"so workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\" He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren't replacing American workers.</p><p>In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they'd allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work - a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/20/h-1b-visa-rule-to-ban-h-1b-spouses-from-working-coming-in-march-homeland-security-says/\">direct contrast</url> with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses' work authorization.</p><p>Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They'd also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p>That's a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p>\"We need a system that's dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that's been set in statute for decades,\" she said. \"The process should be a lot more thoughtful.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

While some ramifications will be short-term, others will be more profound and could force industries like health care and manufacturing to drastically change their operations. The outbreak is also leading companies to accelerate digital overhauls or pivot more quickly to new technology, to meet the new reality of social isolation that could last months. Follow all of Business Insider's latest updates on the coronavirushere[1]. Click here for more BI Prime stories[2]. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump made the decision to invoke a law enacted during the Korean War[3] that could force automakers and others to pivot production lines[4] to meet demand for scarce items like ventilators. </p><p>Some alcohol brewers[5] and luxury perfume makers \u2014 like Louis Vuitton's parent organization LVMH[6] \u2014 are also switching over to make hand sanitizer. Those shifts are likely to be temporary. But corporate America could be reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic[7] for years after the outbreak subsides. The crisis is forcing industries like gambling and tourism to press the federal government for hundreds of billions[8] of dollars of bailout funds to cover the impact. Companies that might have previously eschewed the idea of remote work have been forced to embrace the system for thousands of their employees[9]. And industries like big tech that are reliant on foreign supply chains in China might have to rethink those structures.  But it's also accelerating the pace[10] at which organizations must adapt to the possibilities enabled by the digital economy. Sectors including media, retail, health care, and manufacturing have all changed aspects of their business since the outbreak began in ways that could last well-after the crisis subsides. We took a look at the industries facing the biggest disruption as a result of the pandemic and how some have already begun to change in response.Media &amp; EntertainmentWhile streaming services like Netflix[11] have begun in recent years to challenge how films are typically released in theaters several weeks before becoming available in the home, legacy studios still operate under that model. But the coronavirus pandemic has forced multiplexes to shutter for several weeks[12] and put a major barrier in place to film-release schedules mapped out years in advance. NBCUniversal became the first non-Netflix player in the media space to release some titles on-demand at the same time they are playing in theaters \u2014 eschewing the typical 90-day release window before titles appear on digital platforms. Disney had crossed a similar line a few days earlier, releasing \"Frozen 2,\" which already finished its run in theaters, on its Disney+ streaming platform months before it had planned to. While that appears to be a temporary policy[13] on the part of NBCUniversal, the outbreak and subsequent social isolation policies might last into the lucrative summer months[14] and prompt more studios to join in, and maybe make longer-term changes to how studios release their films. Such a step would not be taken lightly. Entertainment giants have largely resisted changes to the traditional release process out of fear it could cut into the profits it makes from distributing films initially in multiplexes. And there are signs major industry players are trying their best to avoid it by moving major releases further into the year[15]. The new \"James Bond\" movie now won't hit theaters until November, well past the initial release date of April 10. And Marvel's \"Black Widow\" movie, a major tentpole for parent company Disney, is delayed indefinitely. But as box office totals drop to decades-long lows[16], the industry is poised for even further disruption should the pandemic last as long as some experts are predicting \u2014 up to several months or even beyond that. Perhaps more titles will join NBC Universal's recent releases and \"Frozen 2\" on streaming, with untold box-office ramifications.HealthcareBusiness Insider Intelligence has previously estimated[17] that up to 45% of the 1.2 billion outpatient visits that happen annually could be treated via telehealth. Achieving those numbers, however, would require a significant change in strategy for providers \u2014 including staffing the virtual centers with more clinicians. Yet the healthcare industry is often slower than others to embrace technology changes[18]. The sector is highly regulated and profit margins can be slim \u2014 meaning less money is available[19] to fund more dynamic changes. The coronavirus pandemic is not just demonstrating why those digital transformations are critical, it's also accelerating the pace of change. The rapid surge in demand for telemedicine[20], for example, could finally be the catalyst needed to encourage a more profound move towards remote medical examinations. At Providence St. Joseph Health, new tools like an online chatbot[21] are making it easier to screen patients initially to prevent overwhelming of the emergency rooms \u2014 particularly as the availability of necessary equipment[22] like safety masks becomes more scarce.  And as more Americans embrace the concept of social distancing to blunt the spread of the disease, the use of telehealth services is rapidly increasing[23]. So much so that companies are having difficulty finding clinicians to address the growing backlog of patients. Should that demand continue, it would require major changes for the industry. Doctors who have never worked with those digital tools would need to undergo training on the most effective ways to provide care remotely. And figuring out the best ways to coordinate care between the physical hospitals and the virtual world would take time. A few are already being addressed. Gaps in insurance coverage can make it more difficult for some to pursue telehealth solutions. But the federal government just took a major step[24] to allow Medicare providers to get reimbursed for virtual care at the same rate they do for visits to a physician \u2014 paving the way for more seniors to use these services.RetailHesitation to use paper money[25] for fear of germs could heighten consumer interest in mobile payments and force more retailers to adopt those platforms. The US has lagged behind other countries[26] in the adoption of contactless transactions, whether that be tapping a physical card or a phone against the machine. The New York subway system, for example, only recently implemented such a system, while London instituted it in 2014. Most retailers are shuttering operations in physical stores[27] to help prevent the spread of the disease. But even when the country is able to return to some sort of normalcy, concerns are likely to remain over how easily an outbreak could once again spread rapidly[28]. That could force more companies to implement contactless payments in their brick-and-mortar locations. Payments research and consulting firm The Futurist Group found that consumer expectation for contactless features on cards surged 27 percent last year. \"For the first time in these extreme circumstances, people are starting to think about everyday actions, from shaking hands to handing their credit card to the barista,\" cofounder Demitry Estrin said previously[29].Big TechThe technology industry is not the only one that relies on China for critical goods. The trade war between the US and China accelerated plans to move production out of the nation[30]. But the pandemic is once again highlighting just how dependent major tech firms like Apple are on suppliers in the region \u2014and could once again force discussions in the C-Suite on whether to move supply chains to countries like Taiwan, India, or Vietnam. \"It has become clear that many in the chain were woefully unprepared to react quickly\" to the disruption, analysts at ABI Research wrote in a recent report. Companies \"should consider diversifying production and reducing their reliance on a single country, manufacturer, or technology supplier.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this year, for example, that it had a few providers in the area around Wuhan, where the coronavirus originated. Despite that, he said he was optimistic production would ramp up again[31].  There are signs that fears were exaggerated. While rumors circulated[32] that the company would delay the launch of a new line of iPads as a result of the outbreak, those appear to have been false. Apple on Wednesday unveiled a new version of its signature tablet[33] that will be available as early as next week \u2014indicating that its supply chain may be more resilient against disruptions in China[34] than some thought. Still, the decision by key iPhone supplier Foxconn to shut down production in China is projected to lead to as much as a 10% reduction in shipments[35] in the first three months of the year.NOW WATCH: The rise and fall of Pan Am[36]See Also: A temporary staffer at Accenture went unpaid rather than going to work sick.

I'm Terry Gross. It's difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when they might be ruining the world. That's what my guest, Farhad Manjoo, writes. And he's been covering tech for 20 years. For the last three, he's written the New York Times column \"State Of The Art\" in which he explores how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. Now he's writing a series about the Frightful Five. That's his name for tech giants Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, which make up half of the top 10 most valuable companies on the American stock market and which Manjoo says collectively influence just about everything else that happens in tech, as well as the rest of the global economy. He's also writing a book about the five.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Farhad Manjoo, welcome to FRESH AIR. What makes the Frightful Five frightful? What did they have to do to get on your list?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 So what makes them frightful, first of all, is that they are very, very big. And they play a huge role - they all play sort of huge roles in our lives kind of personally and at a kind of society-wide level. So if you live kind of a modern American life, it's impossible to, you know, to live without all of them for most people. And more than that, they sort of are being asked to do and they kind of know more about us than any corporations in history. They're more - they've become kind of more like governments than companies with the amount of money they have, with the kind of power they have over democracy in society.             </p><p>                We're seeing that with the way that, you know, news on Facebook and Google affected the election, with their impact on the economy, you know, the way they're disrupting kind of how retail works, with their impact on jobs and inequality. And eventually, you know, they're all working on artificial intelligence. And their technologies will affect probably most of our jobs. Most of the ways that people make money now are going to be changed by technologies that these companies make.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Yeah. And when you say that they're like governments, they're sometimes more like governments than corporations, you point out that they're doing things that government - that our government used to do in terms of innovation. What are some examples that you're thinking of?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. So, you know, many of the technologies that we use today at kind of their earliest levels were started by grants for the Defense Department or just kind of basic science research. Now a lot of that is being done by these companies. Artificial intelligence is kind of the primary example. These companies are going to be building the future of transportation in the United States, in the world. You know, they're building self-driving cars. They're building drones. They're building kind of the infrastructure of the United States - the infrastructure of the next 20, 30, 40 years in ways that we used to look to kind of governments to do.             </p><p>                You know, Amazon has a fleet of planes, drones. It is in the kind of shipping business. It affects stores around you. Much of the kind of physical world around you is being shaped by, you know, that one company. And you can point to kind of similar ways that all the other companies are shaping the world around you in ways that are sort of huge economically and socially and that are kind of unavoidable. Like essentially - in one of my pieces, I wrote that they kind of blanket the entire society in their technology, and you can't really escape them.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 When we talk about Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, we're also talking about companies that most people don't know are owned by these five mega tech companies. So what are some examples of things that we might not associate with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft but really are part of them?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Right. So Facebook, for example, also owns Instagram - one of the most popular social networks in the world. It owns WhatsApp, which is I think the most popular messaging app other than a couple that are in China. And, you know, it owns Facebook, which reaches 2 billion people a month. Google, in addition to kind of the Google search engine, it has a whole suite of mapping technologies. So there's Google Maps, but there's also Waze, another popular app for getting around. Google owns YouTube. Amazon, in addition to Amazon the store, it owns many different kind of media and publishing properties, so Audible, which has audio books. Amazon also owns Zappos the shoe company. It sort of owns this suite of different e-commerce sites.             </p><p>                And Amazon is sort of doing more than shopping now. One of its huge ventures is artificial intelligence. And you can personify it through their device called the Amazon Echo, which you put in your house and you talk to. It's your assistant. So, you know, these are examples of companies and products that are part of the five. And they really exemplify the way the five are going into - you know, they're really stretched far horizontally. Kind of every product or service that you might want to use, you're going to touch one of these companies.             </p><p>                I think Google is the most - is the perfect example of this. So what Google did a couple years ago is they switched from being Google, Google incorporated to Alphabet. So Alphabet is a holding company, many people may not have heard of it. Every time I write about Alphabet I have to very - I have to specify that we're actually talking about Google. But what Alphabet is is it's a holding company that has Google. Google is its sort of biggest property, but then it has a whole bunch of other companies you may not have heard of.             </p><p>                One of them is like their research lab called Google X, another is something called Google Brain, which is a company that is looking at ways to have artificial intelligence do things like medical diagnosis. There is a self-driving car company called Waymo. There's another health company called Verily. There's sort of a suite of companies that are under this alphabet umbrella related to Google. So they get all their money from Google but, you know, in the future, the plan is that Google as an entity will be just one of many different companies owned by this larger company that will, you know, affect everything that we do.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So like the origin stories for like Google, Facebook and Apple, they're all about like a guy or a couple of guys in a garage or dorm room dreaming up these great ideas that lead to something remarkably innovative. But now you're saying now that these companies that they dreamed of are so big, they're actually in some ways suppressing innovation - the innovations of other, you know, men and women in their dorm rooms or garages dreaming up ideas. So in what ways do you think that these companies now sometimes suppress innovation?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 This, I think, is the huge change in how the tech industry works now versus how it worked back when some of these companies were starting up. It's still possible to come out to Silicon Valley and start, you know, some new app, some - create some new piece of hardware that lots of people like and that takes the world by storm. But there's now kind of a ceiling on how successful your idea can be, and the ceiling is kind of determined by these five companies.             </p><p>                So one of the things that these five companies have done kind of masterfully is create these platforms that startups have to use to get to customers. So they all own these cloud-storage services. So Amazon is an example. If you want to store your media online - so, for example, all the movies that you watch on Netflix are actually stored on Amazon servers - so every time you use Netflix, Netflix is kind of paying Amazon for that kind of storage.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 I have to tell you, I was really surprised when I read that. I didn't know that.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. It's surprising, first of all, because they're such different companies. You wouldn't really know - you wouldn't really think that they would have that kind of connection. And then they're also competitors. Netflix makes original TV shows and so does Amazon. And so, you know, in this way, Netflix has this dependence on one of its competitors. There are lots of different examples of this though.             </p><p>                There - you know, all app makers have to put their apps in the Apple app store or the Google app store. And when they sell in those apps, 30 percent of that money goes to Apple or Google. They all have to advertise on Facebook or Google to get customers because that's become the way to advertise on digital platforms. And so any new app - Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, all the other sort of smaller companies online - have to go through these five to get to their customers. And what ends up happening is that other companies succeed, but always these five benefit off of that success.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So what's an example of how one of these big companies dealt with a new startup or a new innovation that might've been competitive or appealing?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. The best example we've seen recently is sort of what's happened to Snapchat. So Snapchat is a very popular and really innovative idea. So Snapchat is an app where primarily teenagers, young people, send messages that disappear. So they don't last forever. You send a picture and kind of a caption to your friend. They see it for a little while, and it disappears.             </p><p>                And the other thing you do on this app is you make something called a story, which is like a slideshow of your day. And after a day, your friends see it and then it goes away. And these were very popular. And Facebook, which is obviously the leader in social networking, they noticed the popularity of Snap, and several times they tried to buy the company. Facebook offered Snap $3 billion, and Snap turned them down. And then earlier this year Snap went public on the stock market, and it was sort of this huge event for them. You know, this is the next step in kind of the evolution of their company.             </p><p>                And right after that, Facebook copied Stories, this format that's very popular on Snapchat. It copied it to essentially all of Facebook's platforms, and basically overnight the version of Stories in Instagram, in Facebook's company, became far more popular than Stories in Snapchat. And ever since then Snapchat's stock has suffered, and analysts and other people I talked to have a much kind of dimmer view of the future of that company than they did before because Facebook is gunning for them, and it's just really hard to see how they can kind of get out from under that competition.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So you see that as an example of how one of the big companies can suppress or co-opt the innovation of a startup?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. It's the role of startups in the modern tech economy is to provide, you know, ideas for the big companies to kind of run with and make money from. And the other thing that the startups do is they pay a lot of money for the goods and services that the big companies provide. So half of Snapchat's revenues actually go to Google because Google hosts the actual content on Snapchat.             </p><p>                So in this weird way, you know, Snapchat is paying half of its revenues to Google, one of the five. It's being copied left and right by another of the five, Facebook. And it's trying to make money in the Internet ad economy, and the biggest players in the Internet ad economy are Google and Facebook. So it's also competing with them for advertisers. It's a really unenviable position to be in.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Well, let's take a break here, and then we'll talk some more about what my guest, Farhad Manjoo, calls the frightful five, which is Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. He writes the tech column \"State Of The Art\" for The New York Times, and he's doing a series on this group that he calls the frightful five. We're going to be right back after a break. This is FRESH AIR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Farhad Manjoo, who writes about tech for The New York Times. He writes the \"State Of The Art\" column, which explores how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. And he's now writing a series about big tech companies, the ones he calls the frightful five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.             </p><p>                Now, you say the frightful five are so big, and yet they're not regulated by the government and they don't really fit into the standards that we measure monopolies by. Like, they don't conform to monopoly standards. So what's different about these tech companies from companies that we might consider a monopoly?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 So one of the differences is that they're new and they're growing in new markets. And in those markets, it's sort of - in some ways it's kind of too early to call them the winners, according to regulators. And other ways, they've sort of grown really quickly, but many people see sort of more room to grow. So it's, according to regulators and others who study these markets, kind of perhaps too soon to say that they've won.             </p><p>                But for example, you know, Amazon has disrupted essentially all of the retail business, like, everyone from Walmart to, you know, every mom and pop shop has some fear and strategy for responding to the threat of Amazon. But if you look at kind of the size of Amazon and the scope of the entire retail business, it's not that big. It's not even half of all online sales, and it's something like 8 percent of all retail sales in the United States.             </p><p>                So it's growing very quickly, and it has built this infrastructure for kind of the future of commerce. It's built all these warehouses and this very efficient way of shipping goods to people. And everyone who understands e-commerce understands that, like, the future of retail in America belongs to Amazon. But at this point, it's small. And so for regulators who worry about...             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Wait. Small when measured against overall retail numbers and...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Right. So yes. So at this point...             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 'Cause there's nothing small about Amazon so (laughter)...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 (Laughter) You're right.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 ...Sounds like a contradiction.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. But at this point it's, you know, it's about a quarter of the size of Walmart. It's growing very quickly, growing faster than than Walmart is, but it's only a quarter of the size of Walmart. It just beat out last year sales of Costco, and it is a very small percentage of overall retail.             </p><p>                So if you're a regulator worried about kind of monopolies, a monopoly threat, it's difficult to kind of look at traditional ways of measuring monopolies, like how much market concentration there is. Or another thing you'd worry about is, is this company big enough that it's able to kind of control prices? Well, Amazon is not that big. It's not sort of, you know, if you're worried about suppliers of goods being priced out, you really would worry about Walmart more. I mean, Walmart is sort of known for low prices and its demands on suppliers to constantly lower their prices.             </p><p>                And so for regulators who are worried about the dominance of a single company on a sector, Amazon presents this real puzzle for them. In fact it's such a puzzle that progressives and people on the left who've studied antitrust say that we need a whole new slate of laws and regulations to contain Amazon and to regulate it than we do now. The fundamentally kind of antitrust laws that we have today don't work for Amazon.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So what kind of laws are they thinking about?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 So there was this - one of the interesting things I discovered in looking at these five companies is that there's been this sea change in America in how we think about dangerous kind of corporate dominance. And before the 1980s, we were essentially a lot more strict in the United States about corporate size. And you know, the government was a lot more interventionist in preventing mergers that may affect how a market works.             </p><p>                And what happened in the 1980s is that, you know, a group of economists and lawyers known as the Chicago School and the Reagan administration kind of completely changed how we looked at corporate dominance in America, especially about sort of the danger, how we thought of the dangers of monopolies. And so the upshot of that is they looked mostly at price when determining whether a merger could go through, whether a company could get bigger. And they didn't look at sort of non-price effects like customer service or the effect on suppliers or the effect on the environment or adjacent industries.             </p><p>                If you look at price only, you won't - you're not likely to kind of stop Amazon because one of the benefits that Amazon has had is that investors sort of have been betting on kind of constant growth from Amazon, and as a result they don't really expect Amazon to be very profitable. Amazon is sort of famously not profitable at all because it reinvests everything it makes into building out more warehouses and building, you know, to getting bigger for the next year.             </p><p>                And so Amazon really doesn't have to raise prices. It constantly lowers prices. It has this effect on the rest of the of the retail business that results in lower prices. So if you were looking at prices alone, you would say this is a great company. It's great for customers that this company is kind of constantly lowering prices and forcing everyone else to lower prices. Under the kind of current view of antitrust, Amazon seems like a positive force rather than a negative force.             </p><p>                But if you go back, according to, you know, the people who want us to rethink how we do antitrust, if you go back to kind of a pre-1980s view of this structure and this market, you would see that Amazon is sort of, you know, getting its kind of corporate tentacles into a large part of the economy, into shipping, and how warehouses work and robots. Things that will allow it to dominate in the future that we're kind of just not good at regulating at this point.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 My guest is Farhad Manjoo, who writes The New York Times tech column \"State Of The Art,\" and he's writing a series about the tech giants he calls the frightful five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook.

He's now writing a series about the tech giants he calls the frightful five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. The frightful five are also the subject of a book he's writing. He says there's an ongoing debate about whether they should be regulated, but they're hard to regulate because they're so different from the type of corporate giants that antitrust laws were designed for.             </p><p>                So, you know, one of the things people are wondering, like, should this be regulated is, fake news. And, you know, Facebook and Twitter are responding to concerns about fake news and where are ads coming from. So Twitter has issued, like, new guidelines for what it's going to do. You want to run through - Twitter's not part of your frightful five, but it's still pretty big, and it's important in the context of what we're talking about. Do you want to just run through some of the things they plan on doing?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. Both Twitter and Facebook sort of had these - posted these guidelines earlier, which is they plan to - they say they plan to show you who's running these ads, who's sort of - who's paying for the ads and to be more transparent about other ads that those people have posted. So If you - so one of the problems that we've seen is that, you know, these kind of shady groups that are not kind of identified - you don't know where the money is coming from. You don't know what their agenda is. You don't know what other advertisements they've run.             </p><p>                They've been able to kind of place these ads all over Facebook and Twitter and kind of affect the news and, you know, protests and kind of just society in America under these guidelines that companies are rolling out voluntarily. But you know, there might be legislation to this effect. That will be less possible because you'll be able to - it's plausible you'll be able to kind of find out who's running these campaigns.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 In terms of Facebook, aren't they considering, like, working with fact-checking partners and labeling stories that are disputed as fake news?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. So one of the real difficulties about looking at these companies is that in some ways, regulating them, making them better gives them more power. So Facebook is now - so Facebook's news feed is sort of one of the most popular places for getting news in the world. It's you know - combined, more people read it than, you know, all the major newspapers in the country, the TV networks. It's extremely influential.             </p><p>                And right now there's very little fact-checking that Facebook does, which is, you know, what led to this proliferation of fake news and these kind of echo chambers that people have. The solution to that could be that Facebook decides it's going to partner with fact-checking companies, and perhaps it might do fact-checking itself. And Facebook would sort of be in some way the arbiter for what's right and wrong on Facebook. That may help with the fake news problem. I think it's unclear at this point.             </p><p>                But the kind of upshot of that is, on the other hand, you get Facebook kind of acting as something like the ministry of information for kind of every country in which it operates, where, you know, it might be able to decide, like, this is true, and this is not true. How it'll make those decisions and who it'll employ to make those decisions I think is a big question. And, like, suddenly it's going to have this power, and it's going to come about perhaps as a solution to another problem that it itself caused.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So throughout this interview, we've been hearing a lot of your, you know, kind of criticisms about these five companies. And we should say you're hardly a technophobe. And reading about how you have your house wired (laughter) - you've got, like, everything in your house. You've got, like, all the gadgets and all the new, like, Internet of things kind of things. So let's start with, like - you wrote a column about how you've basically made your home into a reality show because your living room and - is it dining room...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 ...Are wired with cameras that - kind of like a lot of public bathrooms, when you walk in in those bathrooms, the lights turn on. When you walk out, they turn off because they have, like, motion sensors. And that's how these cameras are wired. So describe for us the setup that you have with these cameras and why you're doing it.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 OK, so I'll describe the setup first. So they're - it's sort of in the public places of our house so, I mean, not the bedrooms - so the dining room, the living room, the kitchen.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 And not the bathroom (laughter).             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Not the bathroom, yes. And there are a bunch of cameras. I think there are five now. And they kind of get all angles. And the reason I'm doing it is because I have two kids - young kids, 7 and 5 - almost 5. And you know, like everyone else who raises kids today, I take a lot of photos of them and a lot of videos, but I always feel like I'm missing stuff. They're extremely, like, cute. And I'm busy, and they say things, and I - and, like, I always worry that I'm just, like, missing their lives.             </p><p>                So I got this idea because I saw some researchers had done this. Like, psychology researchers had a videotaped their own children to kind of look at their language development. And I thought, wouldn't that be super interesting to do that, to just have memories of my kids? It took a lot of lobbying of my wife, who is just not a tech person at all. And she, you know, was worried about the privacy implications and just, like, the idea of being surveilled in your house.             </p><p>                Eventually I convinced her. I managed to kind of get her buy-in. We've been doing it for about a year now. And it'll be interesting, you know? It'll be really just, like, fascinating to me to watch those videos in the future and to show my kids those videos, you know, like, if my daughter who's now 5 is, like, 25 and to show her, like, what she looked like and what she said. And you know, I'd love to have memories of my own childhood from then. And I think they will appreciate that in the future.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 OK. So part of what I'm hearing here is you saying, like, you're too busy to watch your kids grow up, so you retire, you'll be able to watch the TV version (laughter).             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. I mean, I'll cop to that. It's - that is a slightly cynical way to put it, but I don't think it's wrong. I mean, I think in many instances, we do now miss out on our children. I try not to. And you know, one of the things this helps me with is I don't have to pick up my phone to take videos of them. I can sort of just be in the moment. Like, we were - I was playing video games with my son last night, and he, like, said - you know, he was just, like, very - it was just very interesting and memorable for me to watch him, like, learn how to play this video game. And I would like to see that again (laughter) at some point. And so the idea of having that is - and it just feels like I'm capturing these memories that will one day be useful.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So have you been using those videos to settle arguments such as, no, I did tell you about this; you say I didn't, but I'm telling you I did, and now we will watch the tape and prove that I am right?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 It has been tempting.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 I have wanted to do that. I've just resisted 'cause I don't - especially with my wife, like, I don't want to have the video sort of come between us. I have used it as, like, a disciplinary tool with my kids. So like, I've told my son, you know, like, not to start a fight with his sister. And then, like, I've sort of slyly mentioned I will be able to see if you did, you know, if they're alone in the room or something. And that's the kind of extent that I've used it - just kind of as a warning that I can look back at what's happening.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So my understanding is - right? - that the system that you have, the camera system - it records for a week, and then it deletes everything at the end of a week except for the things you've asked it to save.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah, that's how it works. It's like a surveillance camera at a convenience store, you know, it has a loop.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 (Laughter) Just what everybody wants in their home.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Exactly. It has a loop, a seven day, you know, storage of everything you take. So when something memorable happens, something I just want to capture, I write a note to myself of the time in my phone. And then once a week, I look at the videos. I go back to that time, and then I save those videos.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So what's a moment you're really glad you were able to preserve on video?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 It's the small things. So it's like we're having dinner and my daughter says something completely unexpected, like, makes a joke for the first time - like, this has happened - you know, says something that makes the whole rest of the family laugh. And she's 5. And so that's like - it happens once for the first time. And it like surprised her. And she got kind of embarrassed about it. And she didn't know that, like, making everyone laugh was like a good thing, was like something that people wanted to do. She thought that we were laughing at her.             </p><p>                It was like a cute moment and a touching moment. And, you know, ordinarily, like, we'd just forget that. You just never have that moment. And now I have that. It's just like - dinners - really interesting things happen at dinner, I've realized after this. And just having those moments is going to be really fun in the future.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 So your kids are 7 and 4 now. Do they understand that cameras are recording them? And if so, does it make them self-conscious?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 They do understand that cameras are recording them because I've shown them the videos. It hasn't made them self-conscious. What's actually happened is it's sort of done the opposite. It's made them performative. So my daughter will like - like if we play a song, she'll like go to the camera and sort of do a dance for the camera.             </p><p>                And I think this is the influence of YouTube. They watch YouTube. And on YouTube, there's, you know, kids their age performing for cameras. Like, they have their own sort of YouTube shows. And because my kids watch YouTube and have these cameras that they know sort of are recording things that can be on YouTube, it seems like they act like - they try to act like YouTube stars, like people are watching them and they're trying to cultivate an audience.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Well, I think about how really different that was from like when I was growing up and the only people who were on video were people on TV. And there were only a few channels, so very few people were on TV. And it just seemed so, like, remarkable and impossible. And it's just amazing how like in a few decades how radically things can change. I know I'm stating the obvious, but it's no less remarkable even though it's obvious.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree with that. I mean, I really wonder what my children's sort of conception of celebrity is going to be. They follow a YouTube star who's - it's weird even calling someone a YouTube star. He has - he's, you know, I think around 10 years old. And he has a following of, I think, a few million people on YouTube. And he just does kid stuff. Like he plays and he plays with toys and plays video games. And other kids watch him do this.             </p><p>                We were on vacation in Hawaii, and we passed a kid that my kids swore was that kid, the sort of the YouTube star. And it was as if they had seen like, you know, the biggest celebrity. Like, they were shy. They were talking to each other about, like, whether that was him. They wanted to like go and search for him and get his autograph. It was like, you know, very cute and wondrous to see, but it was something I'd never heard of in like in my own definition would not sort of qualify as a celebrity, as someone worth meeting. But for them, he was like the biggest star of all time.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 Also interesting. (Laughter) OK. If you're just joining us, my guest is Farhad Manjoo. And he writes the \"State Of The Art\" column at The New York Times, which explores how the latest tech ideas are shaping the future. He's now writing a series about the tech companies he calls the Frightful Five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. He's also writing a book about these companies. We're going to take a short break and then be right back. This is FRESH AIR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF OF MONTREAL'S \"FABERGE FALLS FOR SHUGGIE\")                </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Farhad Manjoo, who writes the \"State Of The Art\" tech column for The New York Times and is now writing a series of articles about the tech companies he calls the Frightful Five - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft.             </p><p>                So throughout this interview, we've been hearing a lot of your, you know, kind of criticisms about these five companies. And you write, it's difficult to get jazzed about smartphones and social networks when they might be ruining the world (laughter) and that technologies that we were most excited about 10 years ago are now implicated in just about every catastrophe of the day.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. It is difficult for me to get excited about technology anymore. Like, you know, I write a column about technology. And like, as a result of that, I get to try out basically everything there is. And it's sort of been my dream job because I like wanted to do that. I'm interested in the future, and I'm interested in sort of what's going to happen with all this new stuff. But my sort of default position about whether this stuff is going to be good or bad in the world has changed.             </p><p>                So in the past, my kind of reflexive bias of a new piece of technology was - tended toward optimism. You know, I had the feeling that probably it's better than the stuff we have now, and because it's better than the stuff we have now, it's going to kind of make us more efficient or help us like connect with people. And that has to be good.             </p><p>                And, you know, that's the way - that's sort of the default position of, I think, everyone in Silicon Valley. Like, people who run these companies have this idea that any new piece of technology is probably going to be good. And my own view has shifted on that. I think that we should all be more skeptical of the unseen and longer-term potential dangers of these technologies before we kind of rush to embrace them.             </p><p>                And my default view is no longer sort of optimism. It's more - it's, like, skepticism and just a more balanced view of, like - like, this thing could be big. It could be important. But it could be important in positive ways and plausibly very negative ways and that we should consider sort of both of those things.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 What's an example of something that you initially thought was really positive and you came to see the dark side of it? I'm sure there's many examples to choose from here (laughter).             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 (Laughter) Yeah. I mean, a really kind of clear example is Google, the search engine. So it just sounds - it sounds obvious that providing the world information for free on demand is going to be good. Like, throughout human history, we have been better when we learn more, when we get more information, when we produce more, when we share more. That's sort of the story behind public libraries and, like, encyclopedias and just books and printing in general.             </p><p>                And so you would imagine that having that be accessible to the whole world would just naturally be good. And there are many arguments that, you know - there's sort of a lot of benefit I think from having Google as a search engine and having all this information. But on the other hand, there's no doubt that Google has led to, you know - has fed the rise of conspiracy thinking in America.             </p><p>                Like, anyone can produce some piece of content that questions some completely valid fact about the world. They can put together a lot of information that suggests there's another point of view. Like, there are people who believe that the Earth is flat. And they can make YouTube videos about it, and they can make web pages about it. And then a lot of people start talking about it, and that starts trending on Google. Like, you will search for 9/11 or, like, whether the Earth is flat or not, and you will find at the very, you know, in prominent locations on Google this other view of the world.             </p><p>                And you can get sucked into that and you can start believing things that are completely not true as a result of this tool that was made to enlighten the world. So you know, that's, like, an example of, you know, something that people thought would be obviously good. And it's just much more complicated than we initially thought.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 OK, well, (laughter) you have an interesting job. Thank you so much for telling us about it.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Thanks so much for having me. This was really fun.             </p><p>TERRY GROSS:                 No, my pleasure. Farhad Manjoo writes The New York Times tech column \"State Of The Art\" and is writing a series on the tech giants he calls the \"Frightful Five: Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon.\" He's also writing a book about them.

And with the electorate more ideologically divided than any time since the Vietnam era, it comes as little surprise that both political camps are building up immense war chests. In the last three months of 2019 alone, the GOP pulled in $154 million. That same quarter, the five leading Democratic candidates reported they raised $115 million.</p><p>The river of money flowing into the campaign coffers begs a logical question: Are brands funneling money into the political machinery and, if so, how much\u2014and where?</p><p>The answer to the first question is yes, sort of. It\u2019s, in fact, illegal for corporations to give money directly to presidential candidates. However, the affiliates of a company (its employees or a political action committee) can.</p><p>So, using data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research entity, we called up the figures for 10 of the best-known brands in most of our lives.</p><p>What emerges is a curious picture. For one thing, you might expect most companies, favoring low taxes and reduced regulations as they invariably do, would get behind the Republicans. And yet, many major brands funnel more money to Democrats, in particular tech companies like Google and Apple.</p><p>\u201cSilicon Valley has traditionally leaned pretty left,\u201d said CRP\u2019s director of research and strategy Sarah Bryner. Though with all the recent talk about regulation and busting up Big Tech, \u201ctech companies are moving more to the right.\u201d</p><p>Many brands, she added, \u201cwork both sides.\u201d</p><p>Another important point: \u201cNot all people donate based on monetary interests,\u201d Bryner said. \u201cPeople have ideological interests.\u201d In other words, despite their duties to maximize profits for their employers, company executives still have their personal politics.</p><p>Yet, a further surprise in the data is that the total monies given on behalf of major brands are often comparatively small\u2014less than half a million dollars in the case of Visa, for example. But, Bryner stressed, these dollar figures are not only coming from company employees, those employees are limited by a cap. An individual can\u2019t give more than $5,600 to any candidate in any given cycle.</p><p>Even so, you\u2019d think a guy like, say, Jeff Bezos (whose net worth is north of $116 billion) would hand over a few buckets of cash. Not so. \u201cBezos barely gave anything,\u201d Bryner said. \u201cRich people don\u2019t get rich by giving money away.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1112372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY5-1WT1-DYRK-H4FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Among a handful of antitrust and IT experts, some told The Epoch Times the likelihood of this happening was next to none-while others were adamant that at least one company would face some form of divestiture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The present, intense scrutiny against titan platforms Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple is something not seen before as Congress investigates all four, while the Justice Department (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission are reportedly reviewing one or more of the companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The probes extend down to the state level as well, with dozens of state attorneys general probing the practices of Facebook and Google in separate cases. The barrage of investigations, which appear to still be in the beginning stages, comes amid broad concerns about the effects the companies have on competition and consumers.</p><p>Splitting Apart?</p><p>Doug Melamed, a law professor at Stanford University with expertise in antitrust law and intellectual property, said the probes could result in a wide range of theoretical outcomes, \"from new legislation to no litigation at all.\"</p><p>\"As a practical matter, I think the most likely outcomes are somewhere in the middle, some kind of litigation that will probably result in a settlement with restrictions on the conduct of one or more of the platforms,\" Melamed told The Epoch Times via email.</p><p>The chances of one of the platforms being broken up is \"close to zero,\" according to Melamed, who said other forms of less impactful structural relief, or a \"conduct remedy\" that might restrict future acquisitions, are more likely.</p><p>\"While a litigated victory for the defendants is possible, I think the more likely outcome is some kind of conduct remedy that restricts the defendant from using its dominant platform to give it an inappropriate advantage in complementary markets,\" he said.</p><p>Sally Hubbard, former assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Bureau of New York State, told The Epoch Times that some of the possible outcomes include \"lawsuits by enforcers over conduct that violates antitrust laws, the unwinding of mergers deemed to have been anticompetitive, and new laws or regulatory rules governing Big Tech.\"</p><p>Hubbard, who is now director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, said a breakup of a company is only one type of antitrust remedy and \"relatively rare.\" In her work, Hubbard engages with state attorneys general who have significant authority over monopoly power.</p><p>Big Tech should either run their platforms or compete on their platforms, \"but not both,\" she said. Splitting apart a company could start to address some of the existing conflicts of interests, but it would not solve the competitive issues in the industry.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee is expected to complete a final report on its findings by the first part of this year, the committee's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), told reporters last year. It's unclear what the exact date would be.</p><p>Leaders of the committee and its sub-committee on antitrust have demanded the four companies turn over a wide range of documents, including sensitive internal emails from the companies' top executives as well as detailed financial information, among other company records.</p><p>\"In my view, we'll see at least one company breakup as a result of the current investigations, but it will come in the form of a settlement as opposed to forceful breakup by the DOJ,\" Sean Herman, founder and CEO of Kinzoo, a private messenger app, told The Epoch T imes via email.</p><p>\"I think the most likely action will be Amazon splitting off Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, into a separate entity,\" Herman said. \"There should be strong arguments for breaking YouTube apart from Google, and Instagram from Facebook as well, as long as consumer welfare isn't the deciding factor.\"</p><p>Any potential actions against these companies hinges greatly on the role consumer welfare plays in the probes, Herman said.</p><p>At an early hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the four companies pushed back against lawmakers' accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly, yet vigorously, against rivals in the marketplace. Cicilline said he was not convinced by answers the executives gave, calling their testimony \"evasive.\"</p><p>John E. Lopatka, antitrust scholar and distinguished professor of law at Pennsylvania State University's Dickinson School of Law, told The Epoch Times the probes could involve claims alleging \"monopolization, agreements in restraint of trade, illegal acquisitions, and corresponding claims under the Federal Trade Commission Act for unfair methods of competition.\"</p><p>Lopatka said via email that he \"fully expects\" some antitrust claims \"to be brought by some public plaintiffs against at least some of the big tech firms.\" The odds of a public enforcer forcing at least a few big tech companies to divest something is \"excellent\" he said, with Facebook and Google being the most likely.</p><p>\"These firms are in the crosshairs,\" he said. \"The congressional investigation could lead to new legislation. That legislation might define certain practices of big tech firms to be anticompetitive, or it might impose some kind of government regulation of these firms. The scope of potential legislation is broad.\"</p><p>But whether the plaintiffs succeed in their case in court is another matter, he said.</p><p>In July 2019, the DOJ announced that its antitrust division is \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>At this stage, it appears big tech companies would prefer to get ahead of getting embroiled in any possible antitrust cases and \"attempt to placate the concerns of regulators and make certain concessions on their own terms,\" Attila Tomaschek, digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.com, told The Epoch Times via email.</p><p>Microsoft Comparison</p><p>The last time both state and federal levels were part of a major antitrust case was during 2001 in the United States v. Microsoft Corp. case involving the latter's alleged monopoly on the PC market. Those probes, however, were only focused on one company, in contrast to today's climate.</p><p>In November 2001, the DOJ reached a settlement agreement with Microsoft that imposed a \"broad range of restrictions\" on the company. The court didn't end up ordering any divestiture.</p><p>Those restrictions included \"creating the chance for independent software vendors to develop products that will be competitive with Microsoft's middleware products\" and giving computer manufacturers \"the flexibility to contract with competing software developers and place their middleware products on Microsoft's operating system.\"</p><p>The Microsoft case sets an important precedent, since it shows how antitrust laws can be used to address anticompetitive conduct by major platforms as well as for \"establishing the principle that a monopolist can injure competition just by raising entry barriers to new competition against its monopoly position,\" according to Melamed.</p><p>In 2012, the U.S. government permitted Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and Whatsapp in 2014. Lopatka said courts are wary of undoing mergers several years after the fact and that Facebook, for example, would strive to maintain that any merger challenge now would be unfair.</p><p>\"I don't know what the chances are this kind of a challenge will succeed, but if any firm is going to be broken up, the reason will almost certainly be that the firm illegally acquired competitors,\" Lopatka said.</p><p>Lopatka said similar arguments in the Microsoft case could be leveled against Facebook and Google in particular, in that Microsoft maintained a monopoly of the PC operating system market by squashing the web browser Navigator, and Java technologies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hubbard said there are similarities to the current probes and the United States v. Microsoft case.</p><p>\"Just like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple are engaging in conduct that, in my opinion, amounts to illegal monopolization,\" she said. \"Illegal monopolization requires both 1) monopoly power and 2) that the firm acquired, enhanced, or maintained that power by excluding competition.\"</p><p>There are also different ways companies can be split up. During the Microsoft case, some observers advocated for vertical divestiture that would have separated Microsoft's operating system business from its applications business, Lopatka said. Others pushed for horizontal divestiture, which would have involved divulging proprietary code to create several operating system competitors.</p><p>\"The Microsoft example is merely intended to give a sense of the broad range of divestitures that might be proposed,\" he said. \"But Microsoft was a monopoly maintenance case, not a case based on illegal acquisitions.\"</p><p>According to Melamed, the facts and theories in the Microsoft case are \"very different\" from what the current probes are likely to develop into. Microsoft was about using monopoly power in PC operating systems to protect that monopoly from new competition. It's not clear if the current probes will consist of allegations of that same conduct.</p><p>Lopatka said if the theory on antitrust violations are anticompetitive acquisitions, \"the easiest remedy is to require the offender to divest the businesses it illegally acquired,\" though he noted it would be problematic if the the acquisitions took place years earlier.</p><p>\"As a general matter in tech markets, attempting to create effective competition through structural remedies is exceptionally difficult,\" he said. \"And structural remedies are a drastic remedy and are disfavored when a firm acquires monopoly power through exclusionary conduct.\"</p><p>I think the more likely outcome is some kind of conduct remedy that restricts the defendant from using its dominant platform to give it an inappropriate advantage in complementary markets.</p><p>Doug Melamed, law professor, Stanford University</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2374207282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YF9-HH61-DYR7-816F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 650</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Feature</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But he's also one of the most vocal champions of songwriters in Congress, where he has spent the last few years criticizing regulations on the music publishing business that he says prevent songwriters from getting paid market value for their work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before Christmas, Collins plans to introduce the Music Modernization Act, which will change the way on-demand streaming services like Spotify pay mechanical royalties. The bill alters the standard that the Copyright Royalty Board uses to set mechanical royalties for streaming, and mandates the creation of an organization to collect and distribute them. (Publishers would also be able to make direct deals with streaming services, as many currently do.) That organization, run by publishing reps and self-publishing songwriters, would create a database to make it easier to identify, find and pay rights holders. Unclaimed royalties would be held for three years, then distributed among publishers based on market share.</p><p>That means streaming services would no longer have to do this themselves, or face the legal liability for failing to do it correctly, although the bill would not fix their legal issues over past infringement. If the bill passes, it would reinvent mechanical royalties for the modern music industry, boosting the rates publishers collect while removing a thorny obstacle from streaming services.</p><p>\"You want to bring songwriters into the free market,\" says Collins, 51, over breakfast at the Capitol Hill Club, a Republican gathering spot near the congressional office buildings. Collins, who worked as a lawyer, didn't have any formal background in copyright law before coming to Congress, but an appointment to the Judiciary Committee and a lifelong interest in music made him seek out executives and creators who shared their frustrations. As a conservative, he was unpleasantly surprised how much the publishing business is regulated. So, together with Democrats like <person><nameText>Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, </nameText></person>D-N.Y., he built a coalition of publishers, tech companies and other groups that historically haven't played well together.</p><p>\"I'm from Gainesville, Ga., and there are no music and film companies there, so I can call a fact a fact on both sides,\" says Collins. \"I'm looking forward to telling songwriters we helped fix the situation.\"</p><p>This is an ambitious bill that will fundamentally change the collection and payment of mechanical royalties, one of the main pillars of the music publishing business. How did it come together?</p><p>I've spent the last four years becoming knowledgeable about these issues. We started with The Songwriter Equity Act [which Collins first introduced in 2014], and then we'd move forward, take some steps back, and then move forward again. That's the way big things get done in this city. Some people think it's like a microwave that will solve things in a minute, and they get burnt out.</p><p>You've spoken a lot about the importance of bringing songwriters more into the free market. Will this bill be part of the larger copyright reform process overseen by House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte?</p><p>This will go forward as a standalone piece of legislation -- we want to go to markup in January. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) is interested [in introducing a similar bill in the Senate]. Everyone didn't get everything they wanted, but I can only vote \"yes,\" \"no \" and \"present \" -- I can't vote \"perfect.\"</p><p>How did you first get interested in copyright? It's not a core issue for rural Georgia.</p><p>It's not one that would roll off the tongue of most of my constituents. But when I came to Congress [in 2013] I made a push to get on the Judiciary Committee, and Bob Goodlatte was making copyright a priority. And as I started hearing about some of the issues, especially from the perspective of songwriters, I realized that everything I've done to feed my family -- being a preacher, going to law school -- came from what's between my ears. Intellectual property has value. There are songs I hear that take me to certain places. And if that's so powerfully imprinted on your psyche, does it not have value? And what we say now is, just share it.</p><p>You represent one of the more conservative districts in the country, but your bill will help a lot of very liberal songwriters and executives.</p><p>Early on in this, I met and became friends with ASCAP President <url normalizedValue=\"http://billboard.com/music/paul-williams/chart?utm_source=LexisNexus &amp; utm_campaign=Syndication&amp;utm_medium=How+a+Conservative+From+Rural+Georgia+Became+Capitol+Hill%27s+Top+Songwriter+Advocate\">Paul Williams</url>and if you lined up 10 issues aside from music, we'd probably disagree on all of them. But when I met Paul, I geeked out. Some of my staff think of him as the writer of \"Rainbow Connection,\" but to me he's Little Enos in \u00a0Smokey and the Bandit. That movie was shot in my district, in the mountains. And it's not just a movie -- it's a Southern documentary. I also work on these issues with [New York Democrat] Jerry Nadler, and [New York Democrat] Hakeem Jeffries and I work together on this and criminal justice reform.</p><p>Traditionally, Democrats have paid more attention to the media business. How did copyright become an important issue for Republicans?</p><p>From a philosophical standpoint, there's been a movement that says we don't value intellectual property the way we do physical property. The bent of academia has been toward free and open, but they're protected by tenure. There's a fight for the soul of ownership: Do I get to keep what I produce, whether I chisel it or I write it?</p><p>If you erode the rights of creators, well, erosion continues. I'm from the mountains of northeast Georgia and if you hear the water coming down the mountain it cuts through the clay and the gullys get deeper. And if we don't stop this erosion now, there's not going to be an incentive to create this stuff in the future. This business is way too big for a government subsidy, so it's going to come down to the free market -- which brings in conservative values.</p><p>Is the debate about copyright changing? A few years ago, music executives were talking about what they'd lose in the reform process. Now there's more optimism.</p><p>These companies went from being the disruptors to wanting to protect what they did. That's not the whole conversation, but it's an underlying current. A few years ago I was talking to the CEO of Pandora and I said something about how we need to protect whatever company becomes the next Pandora. And he said, well, we will be. But he had never thought much about that.</p><p>Is there a different attitude toward regulating the big tech companies?</p><p>It's changed in the sense that there's an understanding that these businesses have to acknowledge who they are as corporate citizens. In terms of regulation, the issue becomes, where do you draw that line in terms of free speech? When you look at foreign entities that run bots, that's different. But it's a slippery slope. It's difficult, but it's a discussion we have to have.</p><p>A lot of creators who agree with you on copyright would be disappointed to hear you've been so critical of Obamacare.</p><p>I would ask how it's working for them right now. A lot of those folks are paying more than they should and they have plans that they can afford on a month-to-month basis, but if something happened they couldn't afford the deductible.</p><p>If it weren't for streaming, which five albums would you want with you in Washington?</p><p>I had a guy who drove for me and whenever a song I loved came on the radio I'd say it was in my top 10; he used to say I had 100 songs in my top 10.

And they will almost certainly make you more productive&amp;hellip;</p><p><br/> Blayne Pereira and Jess Stillman<br/><br/><br/> Like the atmospheric phenomenon it\u2019s named after, \u2018cloud computing\u2019 as a term is both huge in scope and slightly nebulous.<br/> Covering everything from software-as-a-service tools such as GoogleDrive and Dropbox, which have become an essential part of daily life for businesses and consumers alike, to infrastructure-as-a-service providers such as Amazon EC2 and Rackspace, which provide the flexible, cheap storage behind some of today\u2019s most sophisticated startups, cloud computing can mean everything from backing up your family holiday photos to deploying vast oceans of corporate information at a distance.<br/> Given the richness of offerings available, many business leaders and managers may not be aware of every type and sub-type of cloud-based service out there, but, by now, most do know that this wealth of possibilities can make you and your employees much more productive.<br/> \u201cThe emerging workforce wants on-demand access for everything,\u201d says David Griffiths CMgr, founder of management consultancy K3Cubed. \u201cUltimately, the goal is to bring people together in such a way so that organisations can have information and knowledge available to them on demand.\u201d<br/> The second annual Cloud Adoption Report from cloud data protection firm Bitglass found that 20% more businesses are employing a cloud application as their main productivity tool compared to the survey\u2019s inaugural year.<br/> As of 2015, nearly half of the 120,000 global firms surveyed (48% to be exact) were using the cloud to boost output and efficiency. It\u2019s not the only poll to come to this conclusion. No matter who you ask, you\u2019ll hear the same thing: adoption of cloud solutions is already mainstream and only set to increase.<br/><br/> Boosting productivity in every domain<br/> So which tools are making the biggest difference when it comes to productivity? The big tech players are, of course, top competitors in the field. GoogleApps led the way with its suite of tools including Drive and Gmail, but Microsoft is rapidly catching up if not surpassing its rival, at least when it comes to larger companies.<br/> Use of its Office 365 offering, which moves productivity staple Office from your computer into the cloud, has tripled in just one year, according to cloud analysts Bitglass. Businesses have doubled their adoption of cloud-based office productivity tools.<br/> \u201cCloud adoption is at an all-time high and Microsoft is winning over Google,\u201d says Nat Kausik, Bitglass\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe surprise is that large corporations, even in heavily regulated industries, are gaining confidence in using cloud apps.\u201d<br/> But the industry behemoths are only part of the story. Cloud computing is one area where smaller firms definitely punch above their weight. Simple and low-cost project management tool Basecamp, for instance, has proven hugely popular. It\u2019s made by 37Signals, a company with fewer than 50 employees.<br/> Alternatives such as Asana and Trello are entering the market and giving Basecamp a run for its money.<br/> Other cloud- based offerings are making an impact on productivity not by replacing traditional desktop tools, but by pioneering whole new ways of working.<br/> Take the likes of Yammer (now owned by Microsoft). Dubbing itself an \u201centerprise social network\u201d, Yammer offers employees alternatives to long email chains and chatting over your cubicle divider by providing a Facebook-like environment for employees to chat about work, share wisdom, and find the right in-house collaborator. Slack is another serious player in this space.<br/><br/> These tools only scratch the surface of what\u2019s available in the cloud. From accounting (FreshBooks) to CRM (Salesforce) or database management (QuickBase), there\u2019s almost certainly a cloud-based offering that can make your people more productive.<br/><br/> Lingering fears<br/> Cloud computing may be in the ascendance, but that doesn\u2019t mean every executive is completely comfortable with these myriad tools. The sheer range of options and their ease of use can cause headaches.<br/> According to a recent survey by consultancy Avanade, one in five business leaders claim it\u2019s impossible to manage the many cloud tools being used by their organisations.<br/> In addition, individuals within a firm often begin using them without seeking formal approval or even informing IT. More than half (60%) of executives expressed concern about this \u2018cloud sprawl\u2019 to Avanade.<br/> Finally, there is the threat of data breaches and outages. Security was the top concern among respondents in a recent Gartner survey. But are these fears well founded? Experts say no.<br/> Of course, organisations need to think carefully about which tools to adopt, how to integrate them, and how to protect their data, but, for the most part, cloud-based tools are no less secure or unwieldy in these respects than those hosted on your own premises. In fact, most problems are due to bumbling employees rather than malevolent hackers and are therefore as likely to occur with a server in your office as one in the cloud.<br/> \u201cCloud services aren\u2019t failing; customers are,\u201d Gartner analyst Jay Heiser insists. So don\u2019t miss out on massive productivity benefits of cloud-based tools because you\u2019re worrying about the wrong things. There are tools available that can make a huge difference at your company right now.<br/><br/><br/> In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email><br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-PMN104109020151110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HBP-BM31-J9XT-P1FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 10, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The problem was the featured \"foreign students\" were Canadians who were either born in Canada or had become citizens.</p><p>The statistics were also misleading: W5 said 100,000 foreign students were crowding Canadian schools when the reality was less than half that, with only 20,000 in universities. Besides, in some professional faculties such as pharmacy you had to be an Ontario resident to apply. Foreign students were not eligible.</p><p>Forty years ago in September, it didn't make sense to the professional journalists on the nation's most watched investigative news program that a student of Asian descent could also be Canadian.</p><p>The intention was clear: real Canadians couldn't get into professional schools because of foreigners. A white student was interviewed who said she had good marks but couldn't get into pharmacy because outsiders were taking her place.</p><p>But how could they have got it so wrong?</p><p>The story had an all too familiar angle. Earlier racist legislation used in the defence of a turn-of-the-century head tax against the Chinese community had warned that foreigners were taking away jobs or opportunities from Canadians. The W5 story was a new spin on the same wedge issue. Get ready to build that wall. Go back home to where you came from.</p><p>It did have one major but unintentional effect: it united a community. The segment would be a watershed moment for Chinese-Canadians, awakening a social and political consciousness that reverberates to this day.</p><p>Four decades later the media has evolved: seeing not one, but two Asian anchors nightly on CBC's The National is a revelation.</p><p>But we are still grappling with issues of race. In an era when the president of the United States can use racism as an election platform, doubling and tripling down on telling four American congresswomen of colour to \"go back home,\" the lessons of W5 are worth repeating.</p><p>The \"Campus Giveaway\" story should be a required part of the curriculum of every journalism school. Because those lessons, it seems, aren't easily learned.</p><p>Maclean's in 2010 essentially recycled the \"Campus Giveaway\" story with a \"Too Asian\" cover story that controversially followed the plight of white students who didn't want to study at a university with, well, too many Asians.</p><p>And in 2014, CTV seemed to learn nothing from past transgressions after I broke a story about racist tweets from a producer of one of its sitcoms, Spun Out. The network decided, as it did decades earlier, to stonewall on accepting responsibility, hoping it would just go away.</p><p>It's a reminder that inclusivity is a work in progress. The Star most recently struck a diversity task force looking at how we report and how to include more diverse sources in our reporting, especially with the upcoming election. Unconscious bias is real.</p><p>But Asian Canadians have much to thank CTV for decades later.</p><p>The W5 show ignited a firestorm of protest from a once silent community, which picketed the broadcaster demanding an apology. It brought together the community in a way that events never really had before.</p><p>There is so much wrong with the program it's hard to figure out where to begin. That includes outrageous shots of a Chinese-Canadian students association meeting with a voice-over stating, \"There are so many foreign Oriental students it's like there are two campuses ... at this meeting not one Canadian student attended.\"</p><p>The story also attracted the key support of political leaders such as Bob Rae and Stephen Lewis, who narrated a devastating rebuttal of the show.</p><p>On a personal level, it encouraged me to apply to journalism school. It made me understand that voices matter. Change is a slow burn. When I started at the Star, Canada's largest circulation newspaper, I was the first staff writer of Chinese descent, which was surprising since it was 1987, not 1887.</p><p>CTV's bungled attempt to create division and controversy under the guise of investigative journalism helped fire up a generation of superstar leaders including Dr. Joseph Wong, who would earn an Order of Canada for his community work, and Susan Eng, who would end up as the chair of the Toronto police services board. Significant community and political leaders such as former MP Olivia Chow; Dora Nip, the president of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario; and the civic firebrands and sisters Amy and Avvy Go rose from the ashes of protest.</p><p>The influential civil rights group the Chinese Canadian National Council was also formed because of the show. The organization, headed by the dynamic Wong as the first national president, would crucially go on to fight for other issues, including a redress for head taxes on Chinese Canadians and to support other marginalized communities. To mark the 40th anniversary of the W5 program, Wong said the CCNC would be rebooted, with a particular interest in youth, social justice and equality issues.</p><p>CTV did eventually apologize, months later, under threat of a lawsuit.</p><p>\"Right after the program was broadcast our critics, particularly Chinese-Canadians and the universities, criticized the program as racist: they were right,\" said CTV executive Murray Chercover at the time. \"There is no doubt that the distorted statistics combined with visual presentation made the program appear racist in tone and effect.\"</p><p>Given the heated and divisive rhetoric over immigration at home and abroad, it's a lesson worth remembering decades later.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Here's how What will blockchain technology mean for financial services? 4 key financial services trends in the new age of work</p><p>FinTechs and incumbents alike are moving from mainly using AI to reduce costs to utilizing its capabilities for revenue generation, albeit pursuing different AI strategies to achieve this. Most incumbents primarily use AI to enhance existing products and services, whereas many FinTechs use it to create new value propositions, as shown in the chart below.How financial service companies are using AIHow financial service companies are using AI (only including FinTechs with annual revenue \u2265$100m to control for different product portfolio maturities)</p><p>This strategy is concomitant with selling AI as-a-service, with 45% of all FinTechs (excluding B2B-only companies) offering AI-based B2B solutions compared to only 21% of incumbents.</p><p>EY\u2019s Global AI Leader, Nigel Duffy recognizes the importance of understanding the implications of mass adoption: \u201cAI is transforming the Financial Services industry and we can expect widespread adoption to continue. As the technologies give way to new revenue streams and transform business functions, it\u2019s increasingly important for organizations to focus on the long-term implications of AI adoption.\u201d</p><p>In the wake of mass adoption, survey participants\u2019 perceptions indicate that AI may replace nearly 9% of incumbent financial services jobs by 2030, while FinTechs anticipate AI will expand their workforce by 19% in the same time frame. Reductions are expected to be highest in investment management, with participants anticipating a net decrease of 10% within five years and 24% within 10 years.Where will AI create jobs in the financial services sector?Where will AI create jobs in the financial services sector?New models, new challenges</p><p>In the race to adoption, companies face similar hurdles. Data quality and access to data, as well as access to suitable talent, are all seen as major obstacles to implementing AI by more than 80% of respondents. The cost of hardware/software, market uncertainty and technological maturity appear to represent lesser hindrances.What are the obstacles blocking adoption of AI?What are the obstacles blocking adoption of AI?</p><p>Yet, even when these implementation hurdles are overcome, the proliferation of AI poses a range of challenges for all parties involved in the financial services landscape:</p><p>AI implementation is expected to lead to an exacerbation of certain market-wide risks and biases. For instance, firms expect AI to create or exacerbate bias in credit analytics, especially when non-traditional datasets are used; While views of regulatory influence on AI implementation diverge, most firms feel impeded by data-sharing regulations between jurisdictions and entities as well as regulatory uncertainty and complexity; Nearly half of all respondents see Big Tech firms, such as Google or Tencent, using AI capabilities to enter the financial services market as a major competitive threat.</p><p>Apart from underpinning these findings with empirical quantitative data, the study also identifies strategy-related aspects which can be generalized across different sectors and entity types. Indeed, synthesizing survey results allows for the conclusion that any firm seeking to develop a successful AI strategy will need to secure sustainable and (ideally) exclusive sources of training data. While underlying algorithms and systems may be complex, they are amenable to commoditization and represent a lesser differentiator than unique datasets.</p><p>The universal need for data at scale encourages the creation of digital platform models which integrate AI-enabled products and services, forming data-rich interfaces between buyers and suppliers. This is already visible in critical tech sector players such as Google who have taken advantage of the self-reinforcing characteristic of AI at scale to establish dominance in search.</p><p>It remains unclear, however, in which direction the power dynamic between incumbents, FinTechs and Big Tech will evolve, especially given the complementary capabilities they bring to the table. Being able to gain a comprehensive overview of these overarching developments will require further in-depth research on the mechanics of early adopter advantages in AI, the burden of legacy infrastructure for incumbents, AI-empowered network effects and AI-induced biases and risks.What is the World Economic Forum doing about the Fourth Industrial Revolution?</p><p>The World Economic Forum was the first to draw the world\u2019s attention to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the current period of unprecedented change driven by rapid technological advances.

However, while these companies monetize digital data to serve ads and drive sales, there\u2019s an unexplored opportunity for them to develop a platform to listen to citizen concerns and serve the public good.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With a lot of deserved mistrust for these companies by the public, caused by misuse of personal information and high-profile data breaches and leaks, these tech companies could work to redeem themselves for the recent trouble they\u2019ve caused by creating a public portal that connects public agencies and citizens during natural or man-made disasters, or even for voicing citizen concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, at a certain point, this is something that the public should expect from the big AI companies that weild so much power over data and information.</p><p>There\u2019s already a lot of public data out there, but it\u2019s very hard for public agencies, for example, to use Twitter as is for such a purpose as monitoring and prioritizing citizen concerns, especially in real-time during disasters. This requires something developed with advanced algorithims and machine learning to pull in, organize and flag priorities from all of the unstructured data, as well as AI for things like language translation.</p><p>An individual or cooperative digital data platform developed by one or more of the tech giants would be a powerful tool to help public agencies navigate disasters or address citizen concerns (safety, public health, infrastructure). Working in partnership, any combination of these companies could develop a cloud-based interface using the data they already possess.</p><p>Smaller companies are already experimenting with this model.</p><p>Planet, for example provided satellite data during Hurricane Florence. Only Planet data was available in this platform, however. A cooperative platform between various satellite agencies such as NASA and European, Indian and other space agencies could be possible, but step No. 1 would be for Planet to share its data.</p><p>AI tech companies could so something similar with social data for a larger social good. This could start with any one of these companies developing an individual platform (like Planet did), which could be queried by various public agencies.</p><p>More than 3 billion peopleare on the internet, and the data they produce could potentially connect geographic location with crime levels and weather events. It can even be of use during or after a catastrophe.</p><p>This is not idle speculation. In November 2015, Chennai, India, got 19 inches of rain in one day. That prompted the worst flooding the city had seen in a century. More than 500 people died as a result, and the property damage ran as high as $10 billion.</p><p>In desperation, people in the area took to Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Public agencies used the channels for real-time geographic-based information. The data helped them administer aid. It also helped aid workers identify neighborhoods where people were trapped or needed blankets.</p><p>One initial concern is privacy, especially with current and future General Data Protection Regulation-style legislation such as California\u2019s data privacy law.</p><p>If these companies are trying to redeem themselves for past misuse of data, this topic can\u2019t be ignored. However, for this proposed platform, only publicly available data would be used for analysis (public social media posts). Such a platform would not share data such as private chats and emails. Between the big three AI tech companies, there would be sufficient public data required for public agencies to effectively handle a crisis or understand citizen concerns.</p><p>This summer, mass flooding similar to that in Chennai three years earlier occurred in Kerala, India, displacing millions. At LatentView Analytics, we quickly mobilized and created a social dashboard monitoring rescue, relief and health topics on Twitter that we provided to the central control rooms of local relief organizations that were on the ground helping during the floods. Here is a look at the dashboard.</p><p>This is a basic example using social data, and the AI tech companies mentioned above would be able to create a much more advanced product with real-time alerts (red, yellow, green) for key topics.</p><p>But we don\u2019t have to wait for a disaster to put such data to use. Imagine if a municipal government, for instance, had a real-time view into what was happening in every neighborhood. If residents knew that the government was watching, they could also use digital channels to voice their concerns about issues involving public safety. AI can identify new needs as they arise. It can then rank needs based on past trends.</p><p>Language, meanwhile, will no longer be a barrier, since AI can translate text into hundreds of different languages. Citizens of polyglot cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco could make their voices heard on such a platform no matter the language.</p><p>Data produced through digital channels would be a check and balance to official reports. If the field team says disaster relief is complete, a city government can check in social media and see if it\u2019s true.</p><p>To illustrate the types of insights such a platform could provide to local governments, LatentView Analytics created a dashboard to monitor and analyze civic concerns being voiced in San Francisco across social media and blogs between May 1 and Aug. 12. There were some interesting findings.</p><p>Data from social media suffers from the same biases as social media itself. There\u2019s potential for trollishness and bullying. Squeaky wheels will get the most attention.</p><p>But such activity is baked into the analysis. Almost 90 percent of social media data is noise or junk. But the big tech companies are adept at tuning out the noise and focusing on the 10 percent or so of relevant data. AI-powered advanced analytics systems can also identify false positives.</p><p>Additionally, the government (local, state, federal) has conflicts of interest when it comes to resolving civic issues, so data would need to be anonymized so it wouldn\u2019t become a place where the government collects and monitors online activist behavior in specific communities. Citizens who would want their voices heard would be pushed to conduct their social media on one of the big platforms.</p><p>Meanwhile, the unconnected population would be invisible. Governments would still need to rely on offline methods to better understand the concern of these citizens.</p><p>All told, the potential positive benefits to the public outweigh the negatives. The examples above, including our own, are simply that\u2014examples of what could be advanced much further by the AI tech giants. A well-thought-out, well designed plaform with proactive training to various public agencies, along with governance processes processes that enabled local-level listening, would also cost these tech companies little (relative to their influence and financial stature). Meanwhile, these companies would gain back some of the public good will they\u2019ve lost with recent data breaches and misuse.

Several department employees had arranged for Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, to be sworn into an influential Pentagon advisory board despite the fact that, in the year since he'd been nominated, Bezos had never completed a required background check to obtain a security clearance. Mattis was about to fly to the West Coast, where he would personally swear Bezos in at Amazon's headquarters before moving on to meetings with executives from Google and Apple. Soon phone calls and emails began bouncing around the Pentagon. Security clearances are no trivial matter to defense officials; they exist to ensure that people with access to sensitive information aren't, say, vulnerable to blackmail and don't have conflicts of interest. Laster also contended that it was a 'noteworthy exception' for Mattis to perform the ceremony. Secretaries of defense, she wrote, don't hold swearing-in events.

Laster's alarms triggered fear among Pentagon brass that Mattis would be seen as doing a special favor for Bezos, which could put him in hot water with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly proclaimed his antipathy to Bezos, mainly because of his ownership of The Washington Post. The swearing-in was canceled only hours before it was scheduled to occur. (This episode, never previously reported, is based on interviews with six people familiar with the matter. An Amazon spokesperson said the company was told that Bezos did not need a security clearance and that the company provided all requested information.) Despite the cancellation, Bezos met with Mattis that day. They talked about leadership and military history, then moved on to Amazon's sales pitch on why the Defense Department should make a radical shift in its computing. Amazon wanted the department to abandon its hodgepodge of 2,215 data centers, located in various Pentagon facilities and run using different systems by an array of different companies, and let Amazon replace that with cloud service: computing power provided over the internet, all of it running on Amazon's servers. That vision is now well on its way to becoming a reality. The Pentagon is preparing to award a $10 billion, 10-year contract to move its information technology systems to the cloud. Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the biggest provider of cloud services in the country and also the company's profit engine: It accounted for 58.7% of Amazon's operating income last year. AWS has been the favorite to emerge with the Pentagon contract. Known as JEDI, for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, the project has been the subject of accusations of favoritism. Two spurned bidders have launched unsuccessful bid protests and one of them, Oracle, filed and lost a lawsuit. Meanwhile, there's an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general. The DOD defends JEDI. The agency's decision-makers have 'always placed the interests of the warfighter first and have acted without bias, prejudice, or self-interest,' DOD spokesperson Elissa Smith said in a statement. 'The same cannot be said of all parties to the debate over JEDI.' What's happened at the Pentagon extends past the JEDI contract. It's a story of how some of America's biggest tech companies used a little-known advisory board, some aggressive advocacy by a few billionaires and some unofficial lobbying to open a backdoor into the Pentagon. And so, no matter who wins the JEDI contract, one winner is already clear: Silicon Valley. The question is no longer whether a technology giant will emerge with the $10 billion prize, but rather which technology giant (or giants) will. There are certainly benefits. The Pentagon's technological infrastructure does indeed need to be modernized. But there may also be costs. Silicon Valley has pushed for the Pentagon to adopt its technology and its move-fast-and-break-things ethos. The result, according to interviews with more than three dozen current and former DOD officials and tech executives, has been internal clashes and a tortured process that has combined the hype of tech with the ethical morass of the Washington industry-government revolving door. Laster did her best to enforce the rules. She would challenge the Pentagon's cozy relationship not only with Bezos, but with Google's Eric Schmidt, the chairman of the defense board that Bezos sought to join. The ultimate resolution? Laster was shunted aside. She was removed from the innovation board in November 2017 (but remains at the Defense Department). 'Roma was removed because she insisted on them following the rules,' said a former DOD official knowledgeable about her situation. Laster filed a grievance, which was denied. 'I've been betrayed by an organization I joined when I was 17 years old,' said Laster, who is 54. 'This is an organization built on loyalty, dedication and patriotism. Unfortunately, it is kind of one-way.' Other criticism, from Amazon's rivals and the press, has centered on the actions of several DOD workers who had previously worked directly or indirectly for Amazon and have since returned to the private sector. The most important of those employees, Sally Donnelly \u2014 a former outside strategist for Amazon who had become one of Mattis' top aides \u2014 helped give Amazon officials access to Mattis in intimate settings, an opportunity that most defense contractors don't enjoy. Donnelly organized a private dinner, never reported before, for Mattis, Bezos, herself and Amazon's top government-sales executive at a Washington restaurant, DBGB, on Jan. 17, 2018. The dinner occurred just as the DOD was finalizing draft bid specifications for JEDI. (Asked about the dinner and several others like it, the DOD's Smith said: 'One of the department's priorities is to reform the way DOD does business. As part of this reform, leaders are expected to engage with industry \u2014 in a full and open manner within legal boundaries \u2014 to find ways to reform our business practices and build a more lethal force.' A spokesperson for AWS said the dinner 'had nothing to do with the JEDI procurement, and those implying otherwise either are misinformed or disappointed competitors trying to distract with innuendo vs competing fairly with their technical capabilities.') Such meetings aren't illegal, but they undermine public trust in defense contracting, said Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law and one of the nation's leading experts on government-contracting law. 'This is a particularly serious example of the revolving door among Pentagon officials and defense contractors, which has been problematic in recent years and is getting worse under the Trump administration,' he said. In July, Trump expressed concerns about the process and whether it was skewed in Amazon's favor. Early this month, his new defense secretary, Mark Esper, announced a fresh review, which will delay the selection of a winner. The judge in the JEDI-related case ruled in favor of the government but nonetheless summed up the process as containing conflict-of-interest allegations that were 'certainly sufficient to raise eyebrows' and a 'constant gravitational pull on agency employees by technology behemoths.' The board that Bezos almost joined \u2014 called the Defense Innovation Board \u2014 was launched in 2016 by Ashton Carter, the last defense secretary in the Obama administration. Carter worried that the Pentagon's information technology was falling behind. He recruited a collection of tech luminaries, including Schmidt, then the executive chairman of Google's parent company, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, by appealing to their patriotism and enticing them with the proposition that the DOD needed the insight and culture of Silicon Valley. Of course, the Pentagon also has an annual infotech budget of $38 billion, and what tech CEO could resist offering products and services to solve the department's problems? Schmidt, the chairman of the innovation board, embraced the mission. In the spring and summer of 2016, he embarked, with fellow board members, on a series of visits to Pentagon operations around the world. Schmidt visited a submarine base in San Diego, an aircraft carrier off the coast of the United Arab Emirates and Creech Air Force Base, located deep in the Nevada desert near Area 51. Inside the drone operations center at Creech, according to three people familiar with the trip, Schmidt observed video as a truck in a contested zone somewhere was surveilled by a Predator drone and annihilated. It was a mesmerizing display of the U.S. military's lethal reach. Yet as Schmidt and his colleagues studied the control panels and displays, they felt like they were witnessing technology frozen in the 1970s. He began asking questions about the challenges of controlling drones thousands of miles away. One operator complained that he had to use his joystick to toggle quickly between systems and screens, turning off one feed to use another. He had to do all of this while simultaneously flying the drone and trying to keep his attention on a target that was frequently in motion. A little later, on the operations floor, Schmidt watched as dozens of people monitored video feeds from drones around the globe. One of the visitors noted that computers using recognition software and machine learning could much more efficiently and accurately perform the majority of these tasks. A little more than a year after Schmidt's visit, Google won a $17 million subcontract in a project called Maven to help the military use image recognition software to identify drone targets \u2014 exactly the kind of function that Schmidt witnessed at Creech. (Schmidt declined to be interviewed. A person close to the innovation board said he was unaware of his company's involvement in Maven. Google, which has funded ProPublica projects on voting and video journalism in recent years, declined to comment on the record.) Schmidt's influence, already strong under Carter, only grew when Mattis arrived as defense secretary. Schmidt's travel privileges at the DOD, which required painstaking approval from the agency's chief of staff for each stop of every trip, were suddenly unfettered after Schmidt requested carte blanche, according to three sources knowledgeable about the matter. Mattis granted him and the board permission to travel anywhere they wanted and to talk to anyone at the DOD on all but the most secret programs. Such access is unheard-of for executives or directors of companies that sell to the government, say three current and former DOD officials, both to prevent opportunities for bribery or improper influence and to ensure that one company does not get advantages over others. 'Mattis changed the rules of engagement and the muscularity of the innovation board went from zero to 60,' said a person who has served on Pentagon advisory boards. 'There's a lot of opportunity for mischief.' In a written statement, the DOD denied that Mattis extended Schmidt's privileges, characterizing them as 'no more and no less' than when Carter was defense secretary. As for Mattis, his former press secretary, Dana White, speaking on his behalf, said: 'In order to do their job, all members of the Defense Innovation Board had full access to the department and its entities. Secretary Mattis insisted on it. He fully leveraged their unique experience to ensure DOD adapted and gained maximum advantage over the rising threats of near-peer competitors.' Over the next months, Schmidt and two other board members with Google ties would continue flying all over the country, visiting Pentagon installations and meeting with DOD officials, sessions that no other company could attend. It's hard to reconstruct what occurred in many of those meetings, since they were private. On one occasion, Schmidt quizzed a briefer about which cloud service provider was being used for a data project, according to a memo that Laster prepared after the briefing. When the briefer told him that Amazon handled the business, Schmidt asked if they'd considered other cloud providers. Laster's memo flagged Schmidt's inquiry as a 'point of concern,' given that he was the chairman of a major cloud provider. The DOD became unusually deferential to Schmidt. He preferred to travel on his personal jet, and he would ferry fellow board members with him. But that created a problem for his handlers: DOD employees are not permitted to ride on private planes. Still, the staff at the board didn't want to inconvenience Schmidt by making him wait for his department support team to arrive on commercial flights. So, according to a source knowledgeable about the board's spending, on at least one occasion the department requisitioned military aircraft at a cost of $25,000 an hour to transport its employees to meet Schmidt on his tour. (The DOD's spokesperson said employees did this because 'there were no commercial flights available.') The fact that such unusual access was granted to a board member who was a DOD vendor raised alarm, according to current and former Pentagon employees. As she had in the Bezos episode, Laster took action. She was a former Marine who'd been a military police officer in the U.S. force in Somalia in the 1990s. Her official title was designated federal officer for the Defense Innovation Board. Laster's job was to make sure that members' conduct was ethical and in accordance with laws, regulations and rules. Blunt and direct, she was hardly a pushover. But Laster had never encountered tech billionaires before, much less ones empowered by the head of her agency. The trouble started after Laster sought a clarification of how to carry out Mattis' sweeping travel directive. She was concerned that it could expose the department to accusations of giving vendors an unfair edge. Three members of the board worked directly or indirectly for Google and two for United Technologies, a major defense contractor. Schmidt responded by threatening to go over her head to Mattis, according to her grievance. She was told to stand down and never again speak to Schmidt. According to the grievance, her boss told her, 'Mr. Schmidt was a billionaire and would never accept pushback, warnings or limits.' The Schmidt episode captured the tension that had emerged inside the department. To one Silicon Valley supporter, it was a 'textbook example of the bureaucracy trying to slow down progress and change using rules, rules, rules.' To Michael Bayer, the former chairman of another Pentagon advisory board, where he had worked with Laster, she was a person of 'extraordinary character' who was working hard to make sure the board 'did the right thing.' It would be hard to find a purer embodiment of the proverbial revolving door \u2014 or a stealth influencer \u2014 than Sally Donnelly. For the past dozen years she has shuttled between the DOD and consulting firms, including at least once with Amazon as a client, that seek to influence the department. During her most recent government stint, Donnelly, 59, came to be viewed as the 'fairy godmother' of the Big Tech advocates in the department, as one Pentagon official put it to ProPublica. Donnelly is known as a superb crafter of narratives, a person who can present ideas in persuasive ways. She honed those skills in her first career, as a reporter at Time magazine, where, among other things, she covered the Pentagon and wrote glowingly of Mattis. Donnelly spent 20 years at the newsweekly before moving to the DOD for the first time in 2007. She worked for the then-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, then later for Mattis, including while he oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the head of Central Command. In 2012, Donnelly departed and opened her own consulting firm, SBD Advisors. 'Our team offers guidance and stealth strategies,' its website boasted, according to a 2014 article in Politico, 'ensuring that clients benefit from the results of our campaigns while outwardly they are under-the-radar.' SBD's clients included Amazon, Uber, Bloomberg, Palantir and others. Donnelly was a master at quietly cultivating a network, one that straddled the permeable line between government and industry. Carter rented an office at the firm before he became Obama's defense secretary, and a Politico story listed him as a SBD adviser. (During Carter's tenure as secretary, Donnelly worked as a DOD consultant.) SBD's other high-profile generals and defense-connected figures included Mullen, former director of national intelligence Dennis Blair and Michael Flynn, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief and national security adviser who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. By 2015, Donnelly's business had announced a new focus. SBD now specialized in 'bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington, DC,' its website declared, by 'facilitating engagements between the technology and defense sectors.' The next year her firm started advising Amazon Web Services on how to land DOD contracts. In January 2017, Donnelly rejoined the department after successfully shepherding Mattis through the Senate confirmation process. Her title, senior adviser, understated her influence. She emerged as one of the most powerful people in the leadership of the Pentagon, according to numerous DOD staffers. She guided Mattis on politics (which was relatively new terrain for him), relations with the White House and dealing with the press. Donnelly also helped the defense secretary connect with outside companies. She helped arrange not only the January 2018 dinner between Bezos and Mattis, but also a previously reported private dinner with Mattis and Teresa Carlson, the head of the AWS division that sells services to governments, in March 2017 in London. (A host of that gathering told The Wall Street Journal that cloud computing was not discussed and that the purpose of the dinner was to talk about a charity involving wounded veterans.) The same year, at Donnelly's behest, AWS' Carlson met with several of Mattis' top aides. People familiar with the matter say they discussed a possible job for Carlson at the Pentagon. No offer was made. (A source close to Carlson said such a job 'would not have been of interest.') A lawyer for Donnelly, Michael Levy, said she 'always adhered to all ethical and legal obligations and acted in the best interest of the national security of the United States.' He added that she played no role in the JEDI contract. 'To suggest otherwise reflects an absence of even the most rudimentary understanding of the government contracting process.' A veteran Marine general, Mattis was initially perceived as skeptical of what Silicon Valley was selling. He knew the flesh-and-blood realities of war and believed in giving autonomy to commanders on the ground. In his mind, anything that reinforced Pentagon leaders' desire to micromanage events halfway across the globe was problematic. Technology, he believed, could make matters worse. But Schmidt was an effective advocate for the power of big data, which he argued had become as important a strategic resource as oil. And he emphasized that the need for technological improvement was urgent: China was rapidly improving. In June 2017, at a private lunch in a Pentagon conference room, Schmidt told him Google's lead over China in artificial intelligence technology had shrunk from five years to six months. 'Mr. Secretary, they're at your heels,' Schmidt said, according to three people familiar with the lunch. 'You need to take decisive action now.' Schmidt wanted the department to adopt a Silicon Valley philosophy that emphasized innovation, taking risks and moving fast. Among his recommendations: embrace cloud computing. In the summer of 2017, Mattis decided to investigate firsthand. He departed on a tour that would include visits to Amazon and Google headquarters and a one-on-one with Apple CEO Tim Cook. At Amazon, despite the tempest about Bezos joining the innovation board, Mattis and the CEO hit it off. The two talked together for about an hour. Mattis gave a pithy sweep of lessons from military history and expressed his view on the perils of overreliance on technology. He noted how the British Navy, once famous for its derring-do, nearly lost the World War I battle of Jutland when ship captains hesitated, waiting for flag signals from their fleet commander. After the meeting, Bezos and Mattis walked to another conference room, where AWS executives made their case that the company's cloud products offer better security than traditional data centers, according to three people who attended. As evidence, they noted that the Central Intelligence Agency had embarked on a $600 million, 10-year cloud contract with Amazon in 2013 and, they said, it was working. To ensure that Mattis could visualize the impact Amazon's technology could have on an actual battlefield, staffers placed on the conference room table a 'Snowball Edge,' a suitcase-sized device with lots of storage that allowed soldiers in remote environments to quickly process information. One of Mattis' last meetings on the trip seemed to tip him into the camp of the cloud advocates. He met with venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen, an influential Silicon Valley figure who first made his name as the creator of the Netscape browser a quarter-century ago. Andreessen was a booster of Amazon. 'You need to get to the cloud,' he told Mattis. 'You'd be stupid not to.' Something seemed to click inside Mattis. He told his staff to begin preparing a memo laying out how the DOD would shift its computing to the cloud. The Pentagon's cloud initiative ultimately ended up being led by Chris Lynch, the head of Defense Digital Service. DDS was no ordinary unit; it was a corps of software engineers hired from Google, Amazon and other tech companies to 'challenge the status quo, burdensome policies and established bureaucracies in an effort to streamline DOD's ability to introduce modern software development, tools and practices,' according to a department spokesperson. And Lynch himself was no ordinary government employee. As a teenager, he had been arrested and expelled from his Ohio high school after he and some friends called in a bomb threat as a joke. But he grew up, earned his high school degree, worked at Microsoft and then ran a series of startups. At 43, he wore hoodies to an office dominated by starched white shirts and still considered himself an insurgent, a point he conveyed by posting a sign reading 'The Rebel Alliance' outside the entrance to his group's office; the name also reflected his obsession with Star Wars. (His team came up with the acronym JEDI for the cloud project.) Lynch had a vision of how the Pentagon's cloud initiative should work: a single DOD-wide cloud run by one provider that would allow the agency to shutter all but the most secret of its data centers. Having one cloud would be ultra-efficient, he said. It would allow programmers to deliver instant software fixes to the entire department, rather than multiple divisions needing to wait weeks for an outside contractor to come by in person. Lynch also believed the department lacked the expertise to manage multiple vendors, each with its own idiosyncrasies. Better to give the entire agency one provider. And as he saw it, only three cloud companies in the U.S. were capable of that mission: Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Some in the Pentagon believed that Lynch's plan presented its own risk. They thought that putting all of the agency's data in one company's system made it more vulnerable, not less, than having it stored with multiple vendors. They also worried such an approach would stifle competition and create a huge monopoly. But Lynch had an advantage in the fight: Donnelly. She obtained full access to the Pentagon front office for Lynch and secured a 'letter of marque' for him, a written statement of support from Mattis that put the weight of the agency's chief behind him. Amazon often seemed to have allies close at hand. For example, the deputy defense secretary sometimes used his chief of staff, Tony DeMartino, as a point man to the key committee on JEDI. DeMartino had been managing director of Donnelly's consulting firm, where he'd had Amazon as a client. He was warned to be 'vigilant and consult' with ethics lawyers before involving himself in matters related to Amazon. But even after the warning, DeMartino repeatedly participated in the cloud-related matters, according to emails submitted by Oracle in its lawsuit against the government, as well as emails obtained by ProPublica and interviews with current and former Pentagon officials. For example, one November 2017 email reviewed by ProPublica, which was copied to Donnelly, shows DeMartino suggested a 'huddle' with the new head of the Pentagon's cloud executive steering group to discuss the man's responsibilities. Later, after DeMartino was no longer serving the deputy secretary, he asked to remain 'linked into' the cloud initiative. A contracting officer who examined DeMartino's role concluded that his actions hadn't affected the JEDI process since DeMartino's role was 'ministerial and perfunctory.' (A person in DeMartino's camp insists that his only activity on JEDI was blocking a 'stupid acronym' \u2014 C3PO \u2014 from being inserted in a larger memo.) A second former Amazon employee would spark more controversy. Deap Ubhi, a former AWS employee who worked for Lynch, was tasked with gathering marketing information to make the case for a single cloud inside the DOD. Around the same time that he started working on JEDI, Ubhi began talking with AWS about rejoining the company. As his work on JEDI deepened, so did his job negotiations. Six days after he received a formal offer from Amazon, Ubhi recused himself from JEDI, fabricating a story that Amazon had expressed an interest in buying a startup company he owned. A contracting officer who investigated found enough evidence that Ubhi's conduct violated conflict of interest rules to refer the matter to the inspector general, but concluded that his conduct did not corrupt the process. (Ubhi, who now works in AWS' commercial division, declined comment through a company spokesperson.) Ubhi worsened the impression by making ill-advised public statements while still employed by the DOD. In a tweet, he described himself as 'once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian.'[6] By the time the draft JEDI bid was formally unveiled in March 2018, rumors had begun surfacing in trade publications that the specifications had been written with Amazon in mind. For example, the bid required that the JEDI contract could not account for more than half of the provider's cloud data load. And it required that the provider have at least three physical data centers, each separated by more than 150 miles. Only a tiny handful of companies could fulfill those mandates. Many tech companies were furious. Indeed, the only major cloud computing company that defended JEDI was Amazon. The harshest reaction came from IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, which would form the nucleus of a coalition that would work to stop JEDI. 'This one-size-fits-all idea is, I think, limited to JEDI and promoted by Amazon, because it fits Amazon's needs,' said Ken Glueck, Oracle's top Washington executive. The DOD's spokesperson said, 'The requirements were not designed around any one provider.' An Amazon spokesperson said that 'from day one, we've competed for JEDI on the breadth and depth of our services, and their corresponding security and operational performance.' Oracle responded by using its own access. As first reported by Bloomberg, Oracle arranged for its co-CEO, Safra Catz, to attend a private dinner in April 2018 with Trump and Peter Thiel, a founder of defense firm Palantir and a Trump ally. Catz told Trump she thought the JEDI specifications had been written so that only Amazon could win, according to a person familiar with the conversation and Bloomberg. Only four companies submitted bids for JEDI. Google had already withdrawn from the bidding, citing its belief that the project should be split among multiple providers. The decision came after its own employees protested the company's participation in Maven, expressing opposition to the idea that their technology would be used to help kill people. Two bidders \u2014 IBM and Oracle \u2014 were eliminated after they failed to meet the bid requirements. That has left only Amazon and Microsoft still standing in the JEDI competition. Both IBM and Oracle filed protests. IBM's protest was dismissed and Oracle's was denied by the Government Accountability Office. Oracle sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, asserting JEDI had been tainted by conflicts of interest. The judge in the case ruled against Oracle. He agreed with the contracting officer that Oracle lost the bid on the merits and that any 'errors and omissions' were 'not significant and did not give AWS a competitive advantage.' Oracle did not give up. The company hired former members of the Trump administration and made its case to allies on key congressional committees. Largely as a result, the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee blocked the DOD from spending money on JEDI until it demonstrated it was using multiple cloud vendors. Then, in July, Trump himself got involved, saying he was considering intervening in JEDI. Soon after, the new secretary of defense, Mark Esper (a former chief lobbyist for Raytheon), requested another review. Much of the information that has surfaced in the press about JEDI is the product of investigations performed by Oracle and its lawyers. Meanwhile, PowerPoint presentations and investigative reports containing allegations of all sorts of byzantine chicanery by Amazon began circulating last year. By the spring of 2019, multiple corporate interests had deployed private teams to investigate their rivals and DOD officials. The Pentagon's inspector general continues to investigate, according to a spokesperson, including 'whether current or former DOD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.' The claims and investigations have left JEDI shrouded in uncertainty. The project might not survive in its current form, according to people knowledgeable about the DOD, but there's little doubt that the agency will move its computing to the cloud in one form or another. As for Donnelly, she left government again last year. A going-away party was thrown for her at the Pentagon. Jared Kushner and former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn attended. Today, Cohn is the chairman of the advisory board of a new firm that Donnelly has opened, Pallas Advisors, which she founded along with Tony DeMartino, the former DOD political appointee and ex-strategy consultant for SBD. Pallas describes itself as a 'strategic advisory firm' that provides 'insight into how governments think and operate.' According to a person familiar with the matter, one of Pallas' staffers, Robert Daigle \u2014 who had previously worked on the JEDI project at the DOD \u2014 turned up in early August in the offices of at least one U.S. senator. Daigle was accompanied by Chris Lynch, who has left the DOD and founded a company, Rebellion Defense, that is seeking defense contracts relating to artificial intelligence. (Rebellion's board members include Eric Schmidt.) Lynch and Daigle were pushing a familiar agenda from a new vantage point: They wanted to explain why a single-cloud makes sense for the Defense Department. And if their own companies got some new opportunities as a result, it went without saying, that would be just fine with them.

On Aug. 8, 2017, Roma Laster, a Pentagon employee responsible for policing conflicts of interest, emailed an urgent warning to the chief of staff of then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis. </p><p>Several department employees had arranged for Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, to be sworn into an influential Pentagon advisory board despite the fact that, in the year since he'd been nominated, Bezos had never completed a required background check to obtain a security clearance. Mattis was about to fly to the West Coast, where he would personally swear Bezos in at Amazon's headquarters before moving on to meetings with executives from Google and Apple. Soon phone calls and emails began bouncing around the Pentagon. Security clearances are no trivial matter to defense officials; they exist to ensure that people with access to sensitive information aren't, say, vulnerable to blackmail and don't have conflicts of interest. Laster also contended that it was a 'noteworthy exception' for Mattis to perform the ceremony. Secretaries of defense, she wrote, don't hold swearing-in events. Laster's alarms triggered fear among Pentagon brass that Mattis would be seen as doing a special favor for Bezos, which could put him in hot water with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly proclaimed his antipathy to Bezos, mainly because of his ownership of The Washington Post. The swearing-in was canceled only hours before it was scheduled to occur. (This episode, never previously reported, is based on interviews with six people familiar with the matter. An Amazon spokesperson said the company was told that Bezos did not need a security clearance and that the company provided all requested information.) Despite the cancellation, Bezos met with Mattis that day. They talked about leadership and military history, then moved on to Amazon's sales pitch on why the Defense Department should make a radical shift in its computing. Amazon wanted the department to abandon its hodgepodge of 2,215 data centers, located in various Pentagon facilities and run using different systems by an array of different companies, and let Amazon replace that with cloud service: computing power provided over the internet, all of it running on Amazon's servers. That vision is now well on its way to becoming a reality. The Pentagon is preparing to award a $10 billion, 10-year contract to move its information technology systems to the cloud. Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is the biggest provider of cloud services in the country and also the company's profit engine: It accounted for 58.7% of Amazon's operating income last year. AWS has been the favorite to emerge with the Pentagon contract. Known as JEDI, for Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, the project has been the subject of accusations of favoritism. Two spurned bidders have launched unsuccessful bid protests and one of them, Oracle, filed and lost a lawsuit. Meanwhile, there's an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general. The DOD defends JEDI. The agency's decision-makers have 'always placed the interests of the warfighter first and have acted without bias, prejudice, or self-interest,' DOD spokesperson Elissa Smith said in a statement. 'The same cannot be said of all parties to the debate over JEDI.' What's happened at the Pentagon extends past the JEDI contract. It's a story of how some of America's biggest tech companies used a little-known advisory board, some aggressive advocacy by a few billionaires and some unofficial lobbying to open a backdoor into the Pentagon. And so, no matter who wins the JEDI contract, one winner is already clear: Silicon Valley. The question is no longer whether a technology giant will emerge with the $10 billion prize, but rather which technology giant (or giants) will. There are certainly benefits. The Pentagon's technological infrastructure does indeed need to be modernized. But there may also be costs. Silicon Valley has pushed for the Pentagon to adopt its technology and its move-fast-and-break-things ethos. The result, according to interviews with more than three dozen current and former DOD officials and tech executives, has been internal clashes and a tortured process that has combined the hype of tech with the ethical morass of the Washington industry-government revolving door. Laster did her best to enforce the rules. She would challenge the Pentagon's cozy relationship not only with Bezos, but with Google's Eric Schmidt, the chairman of the defense board that Bezos sought to join. The ultimate resolution? Laster was shunted aside. She was removed from the innovation board in November 2017 (but remains at the Defense Department). 'Roma was removed because she insisted on them following the rules,' said a former DOD official knowledgeable about her situation. Laster filed a grievance, which was denied. 'I've been betrayed by an organization I joined when I was 17 years old,' said Laster, who is 54. 'This is an organization built on loyalty, dedication and patriotism. Unfortunately, it is kind of one-way.' Other criticism, from Amazon's rivals and the press, has centered on the actions of several DOD workers who had previously worked directly or indirectly for Amazon and have since returned to the private sector. The most important of those employees, Sally Donnelly \u2014 a former outside strategist for Amazon who had become one of Mattis' top aides \u2014 helped give Amazon officials access to Mattis in intimate settings, an opportunity that most defense contractors don't enjoy. Donnelly organized a private dinner, never reported before, for Mattis, Bezos, herself and Amazon's top government-sales executive at a Washington restaurant, DBGB, on Jan. 17, 2018. The dinner occurred just as the DOD was finalizing draft bid specifications for JEDI. (Asked about the dinner and several others like it, the DOD's Smith said: 'One of the department's priorities is to reform the way DOD does business. As part of this reform, leaders are expected to engage with industry \u2014 in a full and open manner within legal boundaries \u2014 to find ways to reform our business practices and build a more lethal force.' A spokesperson for AWS said the dinner 'had nothing to do with the JEDI procurement, and those implying otherwise either are misinformed or disappointed competitors trying to distract with innuendo vs competing fairly with their technical capabilities.') Such meetings aren't illegal, but they undermine public trust in defense contracting, said Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law and one of the nation's leading experts on government-contracting law. 'This is a particularly serious example of the revolving door among Pentagon officials and defense contractors, which has been problematic in recent years and is getting worse under the Trump administration,' he said. In July, Trump expressed concerns about the process and whether it was skewed in Amazon's favor. Early this month, his new defense secretary, Mark Esper, announced a fresh review, which will delay the selection of a winner. The judge in the JEDI-related case ruled in favor of the government but nonetheless summed up the process as containing conflict-of-interest allegations that were 'certainly sufficient to raise eyebrows' and a 'constant gravitational pull on agency employees by technology behemoths.'The board that Bezos almost joined \u2014 called the Defense Innovation Board \u2014 was launched in 2016 by Ashton Carter, the last defense secretary in the Obama administration. Carter worried that the Pentagon's information technology was falling behind. He recruited a collection of tech luminaries, including Schmidt, then the executive chairman of Google's parent company, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, by appealing to their patriotism and enticing them with the proposition that the DOD needed the insight and culture of Silicon Valley. Of course, the Pentagon also has an annual infotech budget of $38 billion, and what tech CEO could resist offering products and services to solve the department's problems? Schmidt, the chairman of the innovation board, embraced the mission. In the spring and summer of 2016, he embarked, with fellow board members, on a series of visits to Pentagon operations around the world. Schmidt visited a submarine base in San Diego, an aircraft carrier off the coast of the United Arab Emirates and Creech Air Force Base, located deep in the Nevada desert near Area 51. Inside the drone operations center at Creech, according to three people familiar with the trip, Schmidt observed video as a truck in a contested zone somewhere was surveilled by a Predator drone and annihilated. It was a mesmerizing display of the U.S. military's lethal reach. Yet as Schmidt and his colleagues studied the control panels and displays, they felt like they were witnessing technology frozen in the 1970s. He began asking questions about the challenges of controlling drones thousands of miles away. One operator complained that he had to use his joystick to toggle quickly between systems and screens, turning off one feed to use another. He had to do all of this while simultaneously flying the drone and trying to keep his attention on a target that was frequently in motion. A little later, on the operations floor, Schmidt watched as dozens of people monitored video feeds from drones around the globe. One of the visitors noted that computers using recognition software and machine learning could much more efficiently and accurately perform the majority of these tasks. A little more than a year after Schmidt's visit, Google won a $17 million subcontract in a project called Maven to help the military use image recognition software to identify drone targets \u2014 exactly the kind of function that Schmidt witnessed at Creech. (Schmidt declined to be interviewed. A person close to the innovation board said he was unaware of his company's involvement in Maven. Google, which has funded ProPublica projects on voting and video journalism in recent years, declined to comment on the record.) Schmidt's influence, already strong under Carter, only grew when Mattis arrived as defense secretary. Schmidt's travel privileges at the DOD, which required painstaking approval from the agency's chief of staff for each stop of every trip, were suddenly unfettered after Schmidt requested carte blanche, according to three sources knowledgeable about the matter. Mattis granted him and the board permission to travel anywhere they wanted and to talk to anyone at the DOD on all but the most secret programs. Such access is unheard-of for executives or directors of companies that sell to the government, say three current and former DOD officials, both to prevent opportunities for bribery or improper influence and to ensure that one company does not get advantages over others. 'Mattis changed the rules of engagement and the muscularity of the innovation board went from zero to 60,' said a person who has served on Pentagon advisory boards. 'There's a lot of opportunity for mischief.' In a written statement, the DOD denied that Mattis extended Schmidt's privileges, characterizing them as 'no more and no less' than when Carter was defense secretary. As for Mattis, his former press secretary, Dana White, speaking on his behalf, said: 'In order to do their job, all members of the Defense Innovation Board had full access to the department and its entities. Secretary Mattis insisted on it. He fully leveraged their unique experience to ensure DOD adapted and gained maximum advantage over the rising threats of near-peer competitors.' Over the next months, Schmidt and two other board members with Google ties would continue flying all over the country, visiting Pentagon installations and meeting with DOD officials, sessions that no other company could attend. It's hard to reconstruct what occurred in many of those meetings, since they were private. On one occasion, Schmidt quizzed a briefer about which cloud service provider was being used for a data project, according to a memo that Laster prepared after the briefing. When the briefer told him that Amazon handled the business, Schmidt asked if they'd considered other cloud providers. Laster's memo flagged Schmidt's inquiry as a 'point of concern,' given that he was the chairman of a major cloud provider. The DOD became unusually deferential to Schmidt. He preferred to travel on his personal jet, and he would ferry fellow board members with him. But that created a problem for his handlers: DOD employees are not permitted to ride on private planes. Still, the staff at the board didn't want to inconvenience Schmidt by making him wait for his department support team to arrive on commercial flights. So, according to a source knowledgeable about the board's spending, on at least one occasion the department requisitioned military aircraft at a cost of $25,000 an hour to transport its employees to meet Schmidt on his tour. (The DOD's spokesperson said employees did this because 'there were no commercial flights available.') The fact that such unusual access was granted to a board member who was a DOD vendor raised alarm, according to current and former Pentagon employees. As she had in the Bezos episode, Laster took action. She was a former Marine who'd been a military police officer in the U.S. force in Somalia in the 1990s. Her official title was designated federal officer for the Defense Innovation Board. Laster's job was to make sure that members' conduct was ethical and in accordance with laws, regulations and rules. Blunt and direct, she was hardly a pushover. But Laster had never encountered tech billionaires before, much less ones empowered by the head of her agency. The trouble started after Laster sought a clarification of how to carry out Mattis' sweeping travel directive. She was concerned that it could expose the department to accusations of giving vendors an unfair edge. Three members of the board worked directly or indirectly for Google and two for United Technologies, a major defense contractor. Schmidt responded by threatening to go over her head to Mattis, according to her grievance. She was told to stand down and never again speak to Schmidt. According to the grievance, her boss told her, 'Mr. Schmidt was a billionaire and would never accept pushback, warnings or limits.' The Schmidt episode captured the tension that had emerged inside the department. To one Silicon Valley supporter, it was a 'textbook example of the bureaucracy trying to slow down progress and change using rules, rules, rules.' To Michael Bayer, the former chairman of another Pentagon advisory board, where he had worked with Laster, she was a person of 'extraordinary character' who was working hard to make sure the board 'did the right thing.'It would be hard to find a purer embodiment of the proverbial revolving door \u2014 or a stealth influencer \u2014 than Sally Donnelly. For the past dozen years she has shuttled between the DOD and consulting firms, including at least once with Amazon as a client, that seek to influence the department. During her most recent government stint, Donnelly, 59, came to be viewed as the 'fairy godmother' of the Big Tech advocates in the department, as one Pentagon official put it to ProPublica. Donnelly is known as a superb crafter of narratives, a person who can present ideas in persuasive ways. She honed those skills in her first career, as a reporter at Time magazine, where, among other things, she covered the Pentagon and wrote glowingly of Mattis. Donnelly spent 20 years at the newsweekly before moving to the DOD for the first time in 2007. She worked for the then-chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, then later for Mattis, including while he oversaw the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the head of Central Command. In 2012, Donnelly departed and opened her own consulting firm, SBD Advisors. 'Our team offers guidance and stealth strategies,' its website boasted, according to a 2014 article in Politico, 'ensuring that clients benefit from the results of our campaigns while outwardly they are under-the-radar.' SBD's clients included Amazon, Uber, Bloomberg, Palantir and others. Donnelly was a master at quietly cultivating a network, one that straddled the permeable line between government and industry. Carter rented an office at the firm before he became Obama's defense secretary, and a Politico story listed him as a SBD adviser. (During Carter's tenure as secretary, Donnelly worked as a DOD consultant.) SBD's other high-profile generals and defense-connected figures included Mullen, former director of national intelligence Dennis Blair and Michael Flynn, the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief and national security adviser who has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. By 2015, Donnelly's business had announced a new focus. SBD now specialized in 'bridging the gap between Silicon Valley and Washington, DC,' its website declared, by 'facilitating engagements between the technology and defense sectors.' The next year her firm started advising Amazon Web Services on how to land DOD contracts. In January 2017, Donnelly rejoined the department after successfully shepherding Mattis through the Senate confirmation process. Her title, senior adviser, understated her influence. She emerged as one of the most powerful people in the leadership of the Pentagon, according to numerous DOD staffers. She guided Mattis on politics (which was relatively new terrain for him), relations with the White House and dealing with the press.Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomDonnelly also helped the defense secretary connect with outside companies. She helped arrange not only the January 2018 dinner between Bezos and Mattis, but also a previously reported private dinner with Mattis and Teresa Carlson, the head of the AWS division that sells services to governments, in March 2017 in London. (A host of that gathering told The Wall Street Journal that cloud computing was not discussed and that the purpose of the dinner was to talk about a charity involving wounded veterans.) The same year, at Donnelly's behest, AWS' Carlson met with several of Mattis' top aides. People familiar with the matter say they discussed a possible job for Carlson at the Pentagon. No offer was made. (A source close to Carlson said such a job 'would not have been of interest.') A lawyer for Donnelly, Michael Levy, said she 'always adhered to all ethical and legal obligations and acted in the best interest of the national security of the United States.' He added that she played no role in the JEDI contract. 'To suggest otherwise reflects an absence of even the most rudimentary understanding of the government contracting process.'A veteran Marine general, Mattis was initially perceived as skeptical of what Silicon Valley was selling. He knew the flesh-and-blood realities of war and believed in giving autonomy to commanders on the ground. In his mind, anything that reinforced Pentagon leaders' desire to micromanage events halfway across the globe was problematic. Technology, he believed, could make matters worse. But Schmidt was an effective advocate for the power of big data, which he argued had become as important a strategic resource as oil. And he emphasized that the need for technological improvement was urgent: China was rapidly improving. In June 2017, at a private lunch in a Pentagon conference room, Schmidt told him Google's lead over China in artificial intelligence technology had shrunk from five years to six months. 'Mr. Secretary, they're at your heels,' Schmidt said, according to three people familiar with the lunch. 'You need to take decisive action now.' Schmidt wanted the department to adopt a Silicon Valley philosophy that emphasized innovation, taking risks and moving fast. Among his recommendations: embrace cloud computing. In the summer of 2017, Mattis decided to investigate firsthand. He departed on a tour that would include visits to Amazon and Google headquarters and a one-on-one with Apple CEO Tim Cook. At Amazon, despite the tempest about Bezos joining the innovation board, Mattis and the CEO hit it off. The two talked together for about an hour. Mattis gave a pithy sweep of lessons from military history and expressed his view on the perils of overreliance on technology. He noted how the British Navy, once famous for its derring-do, nearly lost the World War I battle of Jutland when ship captains hesitated, waiting for flag signals from their fleet commander. After the meeting, Bezos and Mattis walked to another conference room, where AWS executives made their case that the company's cloud products offer better security than traditional data centers, according to three people who attended. As evidence, they noted that the Central Intelligence Agency had embarked on a $600 million, 10-year cloud contract with Amazon in 2013 and, they said, it was working. To ensure that Mattis could visualize the impact Amazon's technology could have on an actual battlefield, staffers placed on the conference room table a 'Snowball Edge,' a suitcase-sized device with lots of storage that allowed soldiers in remote environments to quickly process information. One of Mattis' last meetings on the trip seemed to tip him into the camp of the cloud advocates. He met with venture capitalists, including Marc Andreessen, an influential Silicon Valley figure who first made his name as the creator of the Netscape browser a quarter-century ago. Andreessen was a booster of Amazon. 'You need to get to the cloud,' he told Mattis. 'You'd be stupid not to.' Something seemed to click inside Mattis. He told his staff to begin preparing a memo laying out how the DOD would shift its computing to the cloud.The Pentagon's cloud initiative ultimately ended up being led by Chris Lynch, the head of Defense Digital Service. DDS was no ordinary unit; it was a corps of software engineers hired from Google, Amazon and other tech companies to 'challenge the status quo, burdensome policies and established bureaucracies in an effort to streamline DOD's ability to introduce modern software development, tools and practices,' according to a department spokesperson. And Lynch himself was no ordinary government employee. As a teenager, he had been arrested and expelled from his Ohio high school after he and some friends called in a bomb threat as a joke. But he grew up, earned his high school degree, worked at Microsoft and then ran a series of startups. At 43, he wore hoodies to an office dominated by starched white shirts and still considered himself an insurgent, a point he conveyed by posting a sign reading 'The Rebel Alliance' outside the entrance to his group's office; the name also reflected his obsession with Star Wars. (His team came up with the acronym JEDI for the cloud project.) Lynch had a vision of how the Pentagon's cloud initiative should work: a single DOD-wide cloud run by one provider that would allow the agency to shutter all but the most secret of its data centers. Having one cloud would be ultra-efficient, he said. It would allow programmers to deliver instant software fixes to the entire department, rather than multiple divisions needing to wait weeks for an outside contractor to come by in person. Lynch also believed the department lacked the expertise to manage multiple vendors, each with its own idiosyncrasies. Better to give the entire agency one provider. And as he saw it, only three cloud companies in the U.S. were capable of that mission: Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Some in the Pentagon believed that Lynch's plan presented its own risk. They thought that putting all of the agency's data in one company's system made it more vulnerable, not less, than having it stored with multiple vendors. They also worried such an approach would stifle competition and create a huge monopoly. But Lynch had an advantage in the fight: Donnelly. She obtained full access to the Pentagon front office for Lynch and secured a 'letter of marque' for him, a written statement of support from Mattis that put the weight of the agency's chief behind him. Amazon often seemed to have allies close at hand. For example, the deputy defense secretary sometimes used his chief of staff, Tony DeMartino, as a point man to the key committee on JEDI. DeMartino had been managing director of Donnelly's consulting firm, where he'd had Amazon as a client. He was warned to be 'vigilant and consult' with ethics lawyers before involving himself in matters related to Amazon. But even after the warning, DeMartino repeatedly participated in the cloud-related matters, according to emails submitted by Oracle in its lawsuit against the government, as well as emails obtained by ProPublica and interviews with current and former Pentagon officials. For example, one November 2017 email reviewed by ProPublica, which was copied to Donnelly, shows DeMartino suggested a 'huddle' with the new head of the Pentagon's cloud executive steering group to discuss the man's responsibilities. Later, after DeMartino was no longer serving the deputy secretary, he asked to remain 'linked into' the cloud initiative. A contracting officer who examined DeMartino's role concluded that his actions hadn't affected the JEDI process since DeMartino's role was 'ministerial and perfunctory.' (A person in DeMartino's camp insists that his only activity on JEDI was blocking a 'stupid acronym' \u2014 C3PO \u2014 from being inserted in a larger memo.) A second former Amazon employee would spark more controversy. Deap Ubhi, a former AWS employee who worked for Lynch, was tasked with gathering marketing information to make the case for a single cloud inside the DOD. Around the same time that he started working on JEDI, Ubhi began talking with AWS about rejoining the company. As his work on JEDI deepened, so did his job negotiations. Six days after he received a formal offer from Amazon, Ubhi recused himself from JEDI, fabricating a story that Amazon had expressed an interest in buying a startup company he owned. A contracting officer who investigated found enough evidence that Ubhi's conduct violated conflict of interest rules to refer the matter to the inspector general, but concluded that his conduct did not corrupt the process. (Ubhi, who now works in AWS' commercial division, declined comment through a company spokesperson.) Ubhi worsened the impression by making ill-advised public statements while still employed by the DOD. In a tweet, he described himself as 'once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian.'[4]By the time the draft JEDI bid was formally unveiled in March 2018, rumors had begun surfacing in trade publications that the specifications had been written with Amazon in mind. For example, the bid required that the JEDI contract could not account for more than half of the provider's cloud data load. And it required that the provider have at least three physical data centers, each separated by more than 150 miles. Only a tiny handful of companies could fulfill those mandates. Many tech companies were furious. Indeed, the only major cloud computing company that defended JEDI was Amazon. The harshest reaction came from IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, which would form the nucleus of a coalition that would work to stop JEDI. 'This one-size-fits-all idea is, I think, limited to JEDI and promoted by Amazon, because it fits Amazon's needs,' said Ken Glueck, Oracle's top Washington executive. The DOD's spokesperson said, 'The requirements were not designed around any one provider.' An Amazon spokesperson said that 'from day one, we've competed for JEDI on the breadth and depth of our services, and their corresponding security and operational performance.' Oracle responded by using its own access. As first reported by Bloomberg, Oracle arranged for its co-CEO, Safra Catz, to attend a private dinner in April 2018 with Trump and Peter Thiel, a founder of defense firm Palantir and a Trump ally. Catz told Trump she thought the JEDI specifications had been written so that only Amazon could win, according to a person familiar with the conversation and Bloomberg. Only four companies submitted bids for JEDI. Google had already withdrawn from the bidding, citing its belief that the project should be split among multiple providers. The decision came after its own employees protested the company's participation in Maven, expressing opposition to the idea that their technology would be used to help kill people. Two bidders \u2014 IBM and Oracle \u2014 were eliminated after they failed to meet the bid requirements. That has left only Amazon and Microsoft still standing in the JEDI competition. Both IBM and Oracle filed protests. IBM's protest was dismissed and Oracle's was denied by the Government Accountability Office. Oracle sued the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, asserting JEDI had been tainted by conflicts of interest. The judge in the case ruled against Oracle. He agreed with the contracting officer that Oracle lost the bid on the merits and that any 'errors and omissions' were 'not significant and did not give AWS a competitive advantage.' Oracle did not give up. The company hired former members of the Trump administration and made its case to allies on key congressional committees. Largely as a result, the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee blocked the DOD from spending money on JEDI until it demonstrated it was using multiple cloud vendors. Then, in July, Trump himself got involved, saying he was considering intervening in JEDI. Soon after, the new secretary of defense, Mark Esper (a former chief lobbyist for Raytheon), requested another review. Much of the information that has surfaced in the press about JEDI is the product of investigations performed by Oracle and its lawyers. Meanwhile, PowerPoint presentations and investigative reports containing allegations of all sorts of byzantine chicanery by Amazon began circulating last year. By the spring of 2019, multiple corporate interests had deployed private teams to investigate their rivals and DOD officials. The Pentagon's inspector general continues to investigate, according to a spokesperson, including 'whether current or former DOD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.' The claims and investigations have left JEDI shrouded in uncertainty. The project might not survive in its current form, according to people knowledgeable about the DOD, but there's little doubt that the agency will move its computing to the cloud in one form or another. As for Donnelly, she left government again last year. A going-away party was thrown for her at the Pentagon. Jared Kushner and former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn attended. Today, Cohn is the chairman of the advisory board of a new firm that Donnelly has opened, Pallas Advisors, which she founded along with Tony DeMartino, the former DOD political appointee and ex-strategy consultant for SBD. Pallas describes itself as a 'strategic advisory firm' that provides 'insight into how governments think and operate.' According to a person familiar with the matter, one of Pallas' staffers, Robert Daigle \u2014 who had previously worked on the JEDI project at the DOD \u2014 turned up in early August in the offices of at least one U.S. senator. Daigle was accompanied by Chris Lynch, who has left the DOD and founded a company, Rebellion Defense, that is seeking defense contracts relating to artificial intelligence. (Rebellion's board members include Eric Schmidt.) Lynch and Daigle were pushing a familiar agenda from a new vantage point: They wanted to explain why a single-cloud makes sense for the Defense Department. And if their own companies got some new opportunities as a result, it went without saying, that would be just fine with them.Claire Perlman contributed to this story.

In Washington, Brussels and beyond, regulators and lawmakers are investigating whether the four technology companies have used their size and wealth to quash competition and expand their dominance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four firms are lumped together so often that they have become known as Big Tech. Their business models differ, as do the antitrust arguments against them. But those grievances have one thing in common: fear that too much power is in the hands of too few companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, said Friday that attorneys general in eight states - she and three other Democrats, plus four Republicans - and the District of Columbia had begun an antitrust investigation of Facebook.</p><p>On Monday, a separate bipartisan group led by eight attorneys general is expected to announce an investigation of Google, according to two people familiar with the plan, who spoke on the condition of anonymity before the official announcement.</p><p>And in Washington on Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee is scheduled to hold its third hearing on the impact of competition on data and privacy.</p><p>Here is the case against Big Tech - and what Big Tech has said in response.</p><p>Amazon: Favoring Its Own Products?</p><p>Over the years, politicians and regulators have floated the idea of breaking up of Amazon. That included spinning off its hugely profitable cloud computing business or rolling back its acquisition of Whole Foods.</p><p>But much of the recent scrutiny of Amazon in Europe and Washington centres on whether the company improperly favors its own products over those of third-party sellers, which depend on sales from the e-commerce giant. Regulators are also looking at whether sellers need to use certain Amazon services, like ads and its fulfillment network.</p><p>When Amazon began, it was mostly structured like a traditional retailer, buying products from brands and manufacturers at a wholesale price and selling the items to consumers.</p><p>Amazon has expanded what's available on its site by having third-party merchants sell products directly to customers. By 2018, 58% of the sales on Amazon were made by these outside sellers.</p><p>One line of antitrust questioning looks at the products that Amazon sells under its own brands, like AmazonBasics for batteries or Mama Bear for diapers and wipes. Amazon has more than 140 private labels, according to TJI Research.</p><p>Lawmakers have asked if Amazon takes advantage of data it collects from sellers to develop its own offerings. They have also questioned whether Amazon's products get preferential promotion on its site.</p><p>Amazon has told Congress that it uses aggregated data, not information \"related specifically to individual sellers,\" and that private-label products make up about 1% of total sales.</p><p>Italy's antitrust authority is looking into whether Amazon gives better visibility and search rankings to sellers that ship products through its vast fulfillment network, which sellers pay to use. Lawmakers in Washington have asked similar questions.</p><p>Amazon also faces questions about its growing advertising business, which had more than $10 billion in revenue last year.</p><p>At a House hearing in July, Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., asked a lawyer for Amazon what prevented it \"from using ads as another way to charge a toll for using its platforms.\"</p><p>The lawyer, Nate Sutton, who used to work at the antitrust division of the Justice Department, responded that the ads were \"an optional service\" and that the large majority of products sold on Amazon were not sold through advertisements.</p><p>Apple: App Store Power</p><p>Apple's critics have homed in on its control of the App Store, the marketplace for apps on iPhones, iPads and Mac computers. The App Store has become a crucial way for digital businesses to reach customers, and Apple exerts strict control over its content.</p><p>Apple said it has the right to \"curate\" the App Store to ensure high quality and to rid the store of fraud. As a result, Apple's store generally includes fewer fraudulent apps than Google's.</p><p>But while Apple is the App Store's sole referee, it is also one of the biggest competitors on it. Apple has bet its future on getting customers to spend more on its apps and services, and that relies in part on people opting for them over the apps of rivals.</p><p>Some app developers have accused Apple of abusing its control of the App Store to harm competitors and benefit itself. Spotify has filed such a complaint with European regulators, and makers of parental-control apps have complained to regulators in Europe, Russia and the United States about Apple's restriction of their apps after the release of its own competing service.</p><p>Apple has said that it faces fierce competition and that it doesn't favor its own products in the App Store; and that it isn't a monopoly because it doesn't have a majority share in most markets.</p><p>Facebook: Social Media Consolidation</p><p>For years, venture capitalists and tech strategists across Silicon Valley have admired Mark Zuckerberg's foresight.</p><p>While many industry experts wondered during Facebook's early years whether it would turn out to be the next MySpace, Zuckerberg was searching for an edge to stave off any threats of digital irrelevance.</p><p>His efforts have worked - perhaps too well. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating what some have called Facebook's \"program of serial defensive acquisitions,\" a method of maintaining the company's dominance in social networking.</p><p>Regulators could claim the acquisitions were a violation of the Sherman and Clayton antitrust acts - two laws that have been foundational in the past century of federal antitrust prosecutions.</p><p>That could include some of Facebook's largest acquisitions, like Instagram, the photo-sharing network that it bought for $1 billion in 2012. Just two years later, Facebook spent $19 billion for WhatsApp, the global messaging application used by more than a billion people.</p><p>Competitors believe that long before Facebook bought either of those companies, Zuckerberg kept a close eye on startups that could pose a threat to his company. Facebook has acquired more than 70 companies over roughly 15 years.</p><p>For investigators, one other eyebrow-raising acquisition was Facebook's purchase of Onavo, a mobile analytics company, in 2013.</p><p>Onavo's apps were marketed as free products that allowed consumers to manage and compress their data and download rates, a cost savings for people who live in countries where unlimited data plans aren't common. But the service also gave Facebook insight into what new competitors were doing.</p><p>Facebook walked away from at least one acquisition late last year, the social video app Houseparty, for fear of attracting antitrust scrutiny from regulators in Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>It has also taken steps to improve its user data policies as a result of a previous FTC investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. The social network reached a settlement with the agency in July, paying $5 billion in fines and agreeing to some concessions involving improved oversight of the company.</p><p>Facebook has made the case that it faces stiff competition both at home and abroad, pointing to fast-rising competitors like Apple in the United States and WeChat in China. Further, as it testified before Congress in the summer, the company claims that the barriers to starting a would-be challenger to its business are lower than ever. Startups like Snapchat, TikTok and others have sprung up quickly over the past 10 years, snapping up early adopters and teenagers, a youthful demographic that Facebook - and its advertisers - value immensely.</p><p>Google: Search Results Dominance</p><p>Google is dominant in several different markets and could face antitrust claims in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>One battle is likely to be in search. When Google debuted in 1996, its search results were a simple list of 10 blue links to websites it believed could answer the user's query. \"We want to get you out of Google and to the right place as fast as possible,\" Larry Page, Google's co-founder, said in an interview with Playboy in 2004.</p><p>Years later, Google has changed from sending users elsewhere to answering their questions itself. It has crowded its search results with its own products and services, such as Google Maps, Google Images and Google Flights. Google has gotten so good at answering users' questions, more than half of Google searches now end on Google, without a click to another site, according to a recent analysis by Rand Fishkin, an online-search analyst.</p><p>Google's new approach has given users quicker answers. But some competitors argue that Google is abusing its dominance in search and inducing internet users to not click beyond Google, which starves those competitors of customers for their products or users to see ads on their sites.</p><p>How Google presents its search results could be subject to antitrust laws because it has an effective monopoly, handling more than 90% of searches worldwide, according to some estimates. Because Google has become the primary way customers find businesses, steering users to its own products could be considered anticompetitive behavior under some laws.</p><p>The FTC investigated Google for such a practice. They settled, and the agency did not conclude there was harm to consumers. In 2017, the European Union fined Google $2.7 billion for favoring its shopping service over rivals in search results.</p><p>Google has said that it faces ample competition and that its search engine is designed to give users the most relevant results, not favor itself.</p><p>While Google is predominantly known for search, it makes most of its money on digital ads. It dominates that market, too.</p><p>Over two decades, Google has built a complex web of services that underpin the sale of most ads on the internet. Google is the biggest seller of digital ad space. It is among the biggest providers of digital-ad analytics. And it is, in effect, the broker in most digital-ad transactions.</p><p>Competitors say Google has leveraged that control of the internet's ad ecosystem to push companies to use its advertising technology and buy its ads.</p><p>Brian O'Kelley, former chief executive of the ad-technology firm AppNexus, said Google had undercut his business. He argued that Google forced advertisers to use Google's competing ad technology if they wanted to work with other Google-owned services. And this year, the European Union fined Google $1.7 billion for imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe.</p><p>Google said in response to the fine that it had made several product changes to increase the visibility of competitors. \"We've always agreed on one thing that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest,\" the company said.</p><p>Google's Android software backs at least 3 of every 4 of the world's smartphones, according to analysts' estimates. Google has achieved such scale by giving Android away for free - almost. In return for handset makers' use of its version of Android, Google has required them to place its search engine front and center on their phones and preinstall a series of other Google apps.</p><p>The strategy has helped Google broaden its dominance in online search, reach more than 1 billion monthly users across nine separate services and continue to expand its advertising business.</p><p>Regulators are considering whether Google unfairly leverages Android's dominance. Handset makers are effectively locked into Android because it is the only available smartphone software that hosts the apps that users demand, like Instagram and Uber. (Apple's software also hosts the apps but is exclusively for iPhones.) With that leverage, Google imposes unfair terms on the handset makers, critics have argued.</p><p>The European Union agreed, fining Google $5.1 billion last year.</p><p>Google has argued that Android has increased competition by enabling phone makers to compete with Apple.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0049416033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X11-B0K1-DXMP-K3DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If the start of 2018 is any indication, the criticism isn't about to give up, nor should it, as the FANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - form the greatest concentration of corporate wealth and power the world has ever seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, at the Davos yak-a-thon for the rich and powerful, Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros called Facebook and Google a \"menace\" to society and \"obstacles to innovation,\" comments that should not be dismissed as the ramblings of a grumpy old man. Meanwhile, U.S. cities that have offered gobs of taxpayers' money to Amazon in hopes of attracting its second headquarters are being accused of pandering to latter-day robber barons. Amazon's market value is $665-billion (U.S.) and its founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is the world's richest man. Even small increases in Amazon's share price can add billions to his wealth.</p><p>More than a few politicians now have the FANG companies in their sights.</p><p>One is Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, who is making a career of taking on Amazon. In a tweet earlier this month, he blasted the company for paying some of its warehouse workers wages so low that they had to rely on food stamps to get by (this was confirmed in a new study by Policy Matters Ohio). He recently introduced legislation, called the 21st Century Competition Commission Act, to address potential anti-competitive threats of monopolistic giants. Even a year ago, tighter regulation or the forced breakup of the FANG companies was unthinkable. It no longer is.</p><p>Which one is most vulnerable to break up? Based on the headlines, you would have to assume Amazon is in the hottest of the hot seats because of its sheer size, endless lunges into new markets and control of data.</p><p>Amazon is by far the world's largest online retailer, covering 44 per cent of the U.S. market, and it's the third-largest streaming media company and the top cloud-computing provider, whose customers include the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It sells millions of products and used last year's purchase of Whole Foods to burst into the grocery scene.</p><p>It either is, or will soon be, the United States' biggest seller of clothing, overtaking Macy's. It owns a media studio, a payment service, one of the world's biggest logistics networks and produces a range of electronics, including the Kindle e-book reader and Alexa, the voiceactivated personal assistant. In the third quarter alone, its sales were $43.7-billion and total e-commerce sales could come close to $200-billion in 2017.</p><p>It is easy to love Amazon if you are customer, a shareholder or the sort of capitalist who believes in investing for the future instead of skimming off profit for the present. Unlike most big U.S. companies, Amazon neither pays a dividend nor drains its cash horde to buy back shares (its last buyback came in 2012). It actually doesn't make a lot of profit. Instead, it's obsessed with growth and devotes all its resources to it. \"Your margin in my opportunity,\" Mr. Bezos once said, implying that Amazon's growth is theoretically unlimited, and it is (you can buy a Fiat car on Amazon's Italian site).</p><p>The anti-trust case against Amazon is not immediately clear. In recent decades, U.S. regulators have been more concerned with price than market power, and it is hard to accuse Amazon of price gouging. So far, it has used its market clout to drive prices down, though that could change as the competition in its various market categories dwindles. So far, anti-trust regulators seem to be taking the view that Big Tech should not be punished for its success, that capitalism exists to reward the victor and punish the losers.</p><p>The problem with the current anti-trust approach is that it ignores the value of competition as a source of innovation that can benefit the markets, employment and society as a whole. There was a time when companies were broken up because they simply got too big (AT&amp;T in the 1980s), giving them unassailable positions, not necessarily that they were ripping off customers.</p><p>Has Amazon reached the point where it is an unassailable competition killer? That's hard to say, but there is no doubt that it has developed a fearsome global platform backed by vast amounts of customer and supplier data. It would take a brave company supported by the wealthiest investors to take it on and that seems highly unlikely to happen.</p><p>There is a reason that Amazon's market value might surpass Apple's in the not-too-distant future. Investors think it is becoming essentially immune to competition in the e-commerce space.</p><p>Under Mr. Bezos, Amazon operates as a shark does; incapable of stopping, forever moving forward. As Amazon, expands into new markets - cloud computing and groceries today, who knows what tomorrow - competition is bound to suffer.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning U.S. anti-trust law is highly favourable to Amazon. As Amazon expands relentlessly, this philosophy will have to change. It might be time to break up Amazon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180127rbcdregulyamazon</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH5-71D1-JCRP-C0BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

If the start of 2018 is any indication, the criticism isn't about to give up, nor should it, as the FANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Netflixand Google- form the greatest concentration of corporate wealth and power the world has ever seen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, at the Davos yak-a-thon for the rich and powerful, Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros called Facebook and Googlea \"menace\" to society and \"obstacles to innovation,\" comments that should not be dismissed as the ramblings of a grumpy old man. Meanwhile, U.S. cities that have offered gobs of taxpayers' money to Amazon in hopes of attracting its second headquarters are being accused of pandering to latter day robber barons. Amazon's market value is $665-billion (U.S.) and its founder and chief executive, <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos, </nameText></person>is the world's richest man. Even small increases in Amazon's share price can add billions to his wealth.</p><p>More than a few politicians now have the FANG companies in their sights.</p><p>One is Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, the deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, who is making a career of taking on Amazon. In a tweet earlier this month, he blasted the company for paying some of its warehouse workers wages so low that they had to rely on food stamps to get by (this was confirmed in a new study by Policy Matters Ohio). He recently introduced legislation, called the 21st Century Competition Commission Act, to address potential anti-competitive threats of monopolistic giants. Even a year ago, tighter regulation or the forced breakup of the FANG companies was unthinkable. It no longer is.</p><p>Which one is most vulnerable to break up? Based on the headlines, you would have to assume Amazon is in the hottest of the hot seats because of its sheer size, endless lunges into new markets and control of data.</p><p>Amazon is by far the world's largest online retailer, covering 44 per cent of the U.S. market, and it's the third-largest streaming media company and the top cloud-computing provider, whose customers include the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. It sells millions of products and used last year's purchase of Whole Foods to burst into the grocery scene. It either is, or will soon be, the United States' biggest seller of clothing, overtaking Macy's. It owns a media studio, a payment service, one of the world's biggest logistics networks and produces a range of electronics, including the Kindle e-book reader and Alexa, the voice-activated personal assistant. In the third quarter alone, its sales were $43.7-billion and total e-commerce sales could come close to $200-billion in 2017.</p><p>It is easy to love Amazon if you are customer, a shareholder or the sort of capitalist who believes in investing for the future instead of skimming off profit for the present. Unlike most big U.S. companies, Amazon neither pays a dividend nor drains its cash horde to buy back shares (its last buyback came in 2012). It actually doesn't make a lot of profit. Instead, it's obsessed with growth and devotes all its resources to it. \"Your margin in my opportunity,\" Mr. Bezos once said, implying that Amazon's growth is theoretically unlimited, and it is (you an buy a Fiat car on Amazon's Italian site).</p><p>The anti-trust case against Amazon is not immediately clear. In recent decades, U.S. regulators have been more concerned with price than market power, and it is hard to accuse Amazon of price gouging. So far, it has used its market clout to drive prices down, though that could change as the competition in its various market categories dwindles. So far, anti-trust regulators seem to be taking the view that Big Tech should not be punished for its success, that capitalism exists to reward the victor and punish the losers.</p><p>The problem with the current anti-trust approach is that it ignores the value of competition as a source of innovation that can benefit the markets, employment and society as a whole. There was a time when companies were broken up because they simply got too big (AT&amp;T in the 1980s), giving them unassailable positions, not necessarily that they were ripping off customers.</p><p>Has Amazon reached the point where it is an unassailable competition killer? That's hard to say, but there is no doubt that it has developed a fearsome global platform backed by vast amounts of customer and supplier data. It would take a brave company supported by the wealthiest investors to take it on and that seems highly unlikely to happen.</p><p>There is a reason that Amazon's market value might surpass Apple's in the not-too-distant future. Investors think it is becoming essentially immune to competition in the e-commerce space.</p><p>Under Mr. Bezos, Amazon operates as a shark does; incapable of stopping, forever moving forward. As Amazon, expands into new markets - cloud computing and groceries today, who knows what tomorrow - competition is bound to suffer.</p><p>The philosophy underpinning U.S. anti-trust law is highly favourable to Amazon. As Amazon expands relentlessly, this philosophy will have to change. It might be time to break up Amazon.</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/how-amazon-challenges-anti-trust-orthodoxy/article37748601/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/how-amazon-challenges-anti-trust-orthodoxy/article37748601/</url> The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20180126escenic_37748601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RH1-26K1-F072-J30H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><timeReceived>3:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

There is a great future in platforms think about it,' said NYU economics professor Lawrence J. White, reinventing a key line fromThe Graduatein introducing Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, at an antitrust conference earlier this summer. White offered good advice. Platforms play a major role in every section of our economy today: Google and its search engine, Facebook with its apps and ad business, Apple and its App store, and Amazon with its e-commerce marketplace. </p><p>In other spheres of the economy we have ridesharing platforms Uber and Lyft, streaming platform Netflix, house-sharing platform Airbnb, and many more. 'Platform' denotes an inherently passive concept, merely facilitating interaction between two or more active entities. This certainly appeals to Big Tech, allowing them to dissociate themselves from any agency. Instead, they portray themselves as big, dumb pipes of information without nefarious intent. It was not Facebook that promoted fake news, but rather its users. People and governments are now slowly realizing that tech giants like Amazon are in fact extremely vigorous and assertive entities, managing their walled gardens with tenacity and ruthless precision. Politicians have gone on the attack, albeit in very narrow forms. Earlier this year, Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up platforms that engage in unfair competition. For example, she noted that Amazon collects information from its third-party sellers to identify successful products, and launches 'Amazon Basics' versions that compete with them. Warren argued that Amazon had to choose if they wished to 'have a team' or be the 'umpire.' This allegation is not theoretically incorrect. In fact, the U.S. has along tradition[1]of mandating antitrust remedies such as platform separation. But Warren's analysis did not fully acknowledge and comprehend the full scope of Amazon's behavior on its platform. Even without Amazon Basics, Amazon has never been a dumb pipe or a neutral umpire. Amazon doesn't employ a single strategy to leverage power over its marketplace. Sometimes it intervenes with its own products, but more often it uses its control to squeeze sellers and brands. It relentlessly seeks out either the most profitable or beneficial strategy for every economic transaction, all of which can cause harm to its partners and even the consumers it claims to be 'obsessed[2]' with. It is worth stepping back to understand Amazon's conduct in a broader context.IN A PAPERpublished earlier this year, I argued[3] that Amazon might have achieved its dominant position in e-commerce by engaging in predatory pricing\u2014selling items below cost to acquire market share. I speculated that Amazon could recoup losses from predatory pricing by expanding the role of third-party sellers on the platform and downsizing its own direct sales. By doing so, Amazon could effectively shift warehousing and shipping costs to third parties, and also charge these third parties for every transaction on its platform. Crucially, this theory of recoupment relied on the fact that Amazon is able to leverage its dominance as a platform. In the current e-commerce environment, sellers see little alternative to paying Amazon access fees, in exchange for the unparalleled access to millions of consumers shopping on the platform. In more abstract terms, it appears that Amazon uses its 'horizontal' or platform power to squeeze entities situated on the 'vertical' axis of the supply chain. It is necessary to recognize at this stage that Amazon is a monopsonistic entity. It possesses sufficient 'buyer power' to dictate terms of business to merchants who wish to use its services. We can think of Amazon as the Brooklyn Bridge, the first bridge ever built into Manhattan. While Brooklynites could still use a ferry to access the island or even sail by boat, it is clear that as the only bridge with the easiest and most convenient path to Manhattan, a significant toll could be levied. Even if Amazon engaged in predatory pricing in the past in order to build its 'bridge,' it no longer needs to engage in this conduct, because its position as a monopsonist is now fully established. Even a brief study of the history of American monopsonists reveals the next logical step for Amazon: total control of the 'vertical' supply chain, from the factory floor to the customer's door. Inspiration can be drawn from how J.P. Morgan leveraged his monopoly over the railways to achieve total control over the steel industry, after purchasing Andrew Carnegie's business andcreating U.S. Steel[4]in 1901. If history is any guide, we can assume that Amazon's primary objective right now is not to maximize profit. In fact, profit maximization should only be viewed as a secondary objective, and the anecdotal evidence collected thus far fits neatly into this theory. Instead, the primary goal for Amazon is to gain control over the brands sold on the platform. That dominance will pay far more dividends than short-term profits. This means that the analysis should not focus on the sellers and vendors but rather on the brands themselves. While the sellers played a crucial role in the recoupment theory, at this stage the sellers should be viewed only as instrumentalities that serve that primary goal of gaining vertical control over the supply chain. Amazon does not treat all brands sold on the platform in the same manner. Broadly speaking, it appears that treatment is determined by two main factors: first, the strength of the brand in question in the product market and total volume of sales, andsecond, the amount of directbrandcompetition that Amazon itself has on the 'horizontal' axis with other supply channels such as Walmart or Target. If a small- or medium-sized brand's main channel of distribution is Amazon, then Amazon will probably analyze seller data to determine the brand's profit margins and where to place it in the platform. If profit margins are high due to consumer demand or absence of competition (a good example would be licensed goods for children), then Amazon can source from the brand directly. At times, even if the brand started its life on the platform as a third-party seller, Amazon will exercise a little-known clause in its agreement and force the brand to sell to Amazon directly. When this happens, vendors report that sometimes Amazon will raise the brand's consumer prices due to the absence of competition on other channels, and will simultaneously decrease the amount the brand itself receives per item sold. In a more recent phenomenon, Amazon will offer small brands better marketing support, product reviews, andprominent placement\u2014but only ifbrandssign a deal[5]permitting Amazon to buy them out for $10,000. The program, called Amazon Accelerator, reveals how Amazon contours its strategies to a particular brand\u2014either sourcing from it, competing with it, buying it outright, or just milking it with third-party seller access and fulfillment fees. On the other hand, if the brand power is weaker and profit margins are low due to abundant competition, it would be placed by Amazon in the marketplace. The reasoning is that the allure and therefore the profit margin of these types of brands is too weak to justify the costs of purchasing directly and managing sales on the platform. These types of brands were infamously purged earlier this year, after Amazon had been selling them directly to consumers for years. Amazon even had a name for them: 'Can't Realize a Profit[6],' or CRaP. Although competition from different third-party sellers hawking these brands reduces prices, Amazon's fees do not go down proportionally as a result. It just enjoys a greater percentage of the overall sale. Brands have little control over the Amazon purchase price; they are effectively disciplined by third-party sellers who acquire their goods. Things become even more complex when the brand is sold at other outlets, such as Walmart. From conversations with senior former Amazon employees and merchants, it appears that Amazon has a number of ways to slowly but surely gain control over these types of brands, once it realizes that they are popular and have robust demand. One tactic involves Amazon sourcing directly from the brand and then starting to sell the brand's products below acquisition cost, if Amazon detects that a product is sold at lower price elsewhere, even for a limited time. This conduct is of course extremely damaging for the brand's independence, since it effectively dries up transactions that take place at other retailers. When brands complain to Amazon, they are told that Amazon will stop selling below acquisition cost only after the brand can demonstrate that the product is no longer offered at a lower price anywhere else. In some cases, Amazon will later send the vendor an invoice and request that the vendor pay for what it terms 'lost margins'; in other words, the vendor or brand must reimburse Amazon for its below-acquisition-cost pricing. In antitrust law, predatory pricing is traditionally associated with efforts to expand control over consumer choices. For instance, an airline will heavily discount its fares on a given route in order to knock out competition and gain exclusive control over the route. But the primary goal of Amazon's pricing tactics in this case is not to harm other outlets\u2014that is only a welcomed side effect. Rather, it is to increase Amazon's power over the brand by becoming the brand's dominant buyer. If Amazon offers the brand's products at the lowest price, it will inherently capture the majority of that brand's sales volume and make the brand increasingly reliant on Amazon. This also pushes brands to operate with razor-thin profits, since there is no longer robust competition from multiple buyers. Subsequently, these 'captured' brands become much more susceptible to sale volume fluctuations and therefore more cooperative with Amazon. So in this case the predation is used to expand Amazon's control up the supply chain. Amazon would probably say it engages in these pricing tactics to benefit the consumer. But if Amazon's true goal was to offer a given product at the lowest price possible, it could do so by implementing a price-matching policy, orother means. Instead, it decided to penalize its vendors and sellers. Thegoalis notto offer a given product at the lowest price possible, but only to be the cheapest available option, even if in reality other outlets could offer\u2014and have beenoffering\u2014a particular product at a lower price. That explains how Amazon can harm consumers while offering the cheapest option. In addition, predatory pricing also affects innovation in this case: A supplier or merchant will not improve its products if Amazon is squeezing their profits so much that substantially fewer resources can be put into investment. Since Amazon cannot deploy the same pricing tactic in its marketplace, where third-party sellers determine the sale price, it has developed other tools that help ensure brands offer their products at the lowest available price on the platform, at the expense of general consumer welfare. According to sellers I've spoken with, Amazon will manipulate the 'buy box,'suppressing a seller's opportunity to getprime placementin front of customers unless they match prices at other outlets. Some have speculated that Amazon also manipulates ad placement, though there's no hard evidence of that. Crucially, on other outlets, shipping is calculated separately. Because Amazon Prime's shipping is free to the customer, the matching price sellers must conform to on Amazon will ultimately be much lower for their bottom line. Although Amazon customers pay an annual fee for their Prime subscription, this fee does not cover the costs associated with shipping. Sellers still have to pay Amazon fulfillment fees, while struggling to match a price that doesn't take shipping into account. Sellers who sell to multiple outlets admit that the prices of the products they are selling could have been lower in those outlets, but due to Amazon's price-matching scheme they are higher. And with the ever-increasing fulfillment fees levied by Amazon on third-party sellers, this situation is only further exacerbated. Walmart and other outlets can theoretically offer products at lower prices because shoppers can buy a product at the store, meaning that those outlets do not incur any additional shipping costs. But Amazon's disciplinary efforts effectively remove this option, making non-Amazon consumers pay more. Recently, Amazon amended its agreements with sellers to reflect this policy. The 'fair pricing policy' corroborates seller claims, explicitly stating that Amazon 'regularly monitors the prices of items on our marketplaces, including shipping costs, and compares them with other prices available to our customers.' Amazon even threatens to discipline sellers that 'harm customer trust' by removing the buy box, removing listings, suspending shipping options (including independently fulfilled offers), and even terminating the ability to sell through the marketplace. Conduct that harms customer trust includes selling products on Amazon at higher prices than those available in other outlets. Antitrust scholars and other critics who have rushed to Amazon's defense routinely point out that regulation and enforcement should protect competition and not competitors. In addition, they argue that while Amazon's conduct might harm competitors, this conduct is legitimate since it benefits consumers. Even if we are to accept their basic proposition regarding the role of antitrust regulation and enforcement, it is very hard to argue that raising the prices that customers have to pay for same products in outlets like Target is beneficial to anyone but Amazon. If the goal of Amazon is not to maximize profit by exploiting sellers' data, but rather to use sellers to exert control over brands, investigators and regulators should focus on the tools and conduct that Amazon is engaging in to achieve this dominance. Only by recognizing Amazon's end goal, its multiplemonopsonisticstrategies to get there, and the effect on consumers will policymakers be able to design effective policies that will truly rein in this extreme use of market power.

But we have already done many of the things politicians demand of America's leading businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">''Hello, Jay?'' The voice on the line was instantly recognizable. ''It's Bernie Sanders.'' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Given that Senator Sanders is a frequent critic of Amazon, you might think he was calling to complain about something my company had done -- or wasn't doing. But on this day, in November 2018, his message was different.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''Listen,'' he told me, ''I just want to congratulate Amazon for raising your minimum wage to $15 an hour. That's good for your workers. It's the right thing to do. Please thank Jeff Bezos for me.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  To be sure, Senator Sanders's appreciation for Amazon and our founder, Mr. Bezos, didn't last long. He and Senator Elizabeth Warren, both candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, regularly attack the company on the campaign trail, other candidates sometimes echo them. Still, his call at least recognized a reality often forgotten or ignored in debates about the role a company like ours can and should play in the economy.</p><p>  This year's elections will center, as they almost always do, on the economy -- specifically, on jobs and how things like health care and training opportunities affect the way American workers feel about their economic circumstances. As the employer that has added more jobs to the American economy over the last decade than any other, we at Amazon have a unique perspective.</p><p>  Critics and reporters often categorize Amazon as a big tech company, and it is true that digital technology powers much of our businesses. But in today's economy, phrases like ''big tech'' and the ''tech industry'' obscure more than they enlighten. Our core business, consumer retail, involves hundreds of thousands of employees who store, ship and deliver billions of physical goods -- not bits of data -- via airplanes, trucks and vans around the world. We are not a social media company, a news aggregator or a forum for political advocacy (or disinformation).</p><p>  While we fully agree that a company of Amazon's size should be scrutinized, we also believe people should know that Amazon is doing exactly what many lawmakers and critics insist the private sector should do. And because Amazon is a large company with hundreds of thousands of employees, as well as contractual relationships with hundreds of thousands of other businesses of all sizes, what we do can generate positive ripple effects across the country.</p><p>  When Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour, we made sure that every one of the company's warehouse workers, known as fulfillment center associates, got a pay increase. But the change wasn't just good for our associates. We have 500,000 employees in 40 states; when a company our size increases wages, competitors feel pressure to do the same for their own workers, or risk losing them. Indeed, after our wage-increase announcement, we received a record 848,775 applications for hourly positions.</p><p>  We know $15 is not a lot. In fact, we believe $15 should be the minimum anyone in the United States is paid for an hour of labor, and in most areas of the country our starting wage is even higher. But while the debate about Amazon's impact at times focuses on how our hourly jobs compare to jobs of the past, or to an idealized vision of the future, the truth is that more than 40 million Americans earn less than the lowest-paid Amazon associate. For many people, a job at one of our fulfillment centers is by far the best option available in their region. And we are proud of that -- even as we agree that our political and business leaders must work together to create more and better options for all America's workers.</p><p>  One place to start: Raise the federal minimum wage to $15 from its current rate of $7.25 -- something only members of Congress like Senator Sanders can do. If Congress were to follow our lead, all it would take to greatly improve the lives of America's lowest-paid workers is the president's signature.</p><p>  In keeping with what political leaders say they want to see from companies, Amazon has plowed $270 billion into the domestic economy since 2010. In economically struggling areas like Fall River, Mass., and the Inland Empire in California, our recent investments and hiring have helped to drive down the local unemployment rate and added hundreds of millions of dollars to local economies.</p><p>  Improving the lives of American workers is about more than wages. We compete fiercely with Silicon Valley companies to hire the best software engineers, computer science Ph.D.s and data scientists. That means offering generous health care and other benefits on top of highly competitive pay. To cut costs, we could follow the model of some other companies by giving cheaper, basic benefits to our hourly work force. Instead, we not only pay our hourly workers significantly better than most of our consumer retail competitors, we also provide the same comprehensive health insurance and parental leave benefits to our lowest-paid associates as we do our most senior executives.</p><p>  While the United States may never restore the manufacturing sector to its 20th-century heights, we can train Americans for the high-paying jobs of tomorrow. With that goal, Amazon offers fulfillment center workers the chance to learn new skills and earn certificates in high-demand fields that offer better-paying job opportunities.</p><p>  Our Career Choice program prepays up to 95 percent of tuition and fees -- making it almost free for employees to learn new skills. In most cases, associates who finish Career Choice become eligible for jobs that double or triple their current pay -- either within Amazon or, if they prefer, with another employer. Overall, Amazon is investing $700 million to provide training to 100,000 of our domestic employees by 2025. Once again, the scale of Amazon's investment in its own work force will influence other major companies to follow suit.</p><p>  All big institutions, public and private, merit scrutiny. At Amazon, we welcome it -- from lawmakers, regulators and customers. And we know that our critics will at times have good ideas about how we, and other major companies, can do both more and better.</p><p>  But we also hope that, in examining what we already do, those critics at least acknowledge this: When it comes to creating jobs, raising wages, providing benefits and training employees for higher-paying jobs, Amazon is doing many good things -- for the economy, and for American workers.</p><p>  Jay Carney, the White House press secretary from 2011 to 2014, is the senior vice president for global corporate affairs at Amazon.</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Tough trustbusting talk swirls through the growing Democratic presidential field and the halls of Congress, and antitrust experts warn that government inaction in the face of tech's untrammeled bigness threatens competition, future innovation and democracy itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsurprisingly, tech leaders have pushed back. If American tech is hobbled by regulation and antitrust suits, they argue, the nation will cede the market to other, less democratic actors, especially China. There are also less noble reasons for their antiregulatory stance: Comfort with monopoly power is deeply rooted in an industry where corporate survival long demanded rapid growth and elimination of market rivals. As venture capitalist Peter Thiel piquantly put it, \"competition is for losers.\"           </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there is an example of antitrust enforcement in Silicon Valley's own history that provides a powerful counterargument - both to those who argue that tech must be broken up, and to those that counter that tech must be left alone. The 1956 AT&amp;T consent decree reveals that some antitrust enforcement can be critical to opening up new, competitive marketplaces, even when the biggest of big-tech companies are allowed to stay intact.</p><p>Ma Bell's antitrust saga is nearly as old as antitrust legislation itself. In 1913, an agreement between the federal government and AT&amp;T turned the company into a regulated telephone monopoly. The reasoning had to do with the nature of telephony: Only a single network, lawmakers recognized, could provide seamless, universal service. Protected in its market position and flush with government contracts during and after World War II, the phone company became an extraordinary seedbed of technological innovation. This included the device that made the information revolution possible: the electronic transistor.</p><p>Riding high on this technological triumph that became foundational to all modern electronics, the company made increasingly bold moves into the computer market. The feds would have none of it. Having witnessed how massive corporations had been critical contributors to the rise of European fascism, America's postwar mood had turned sharply anti-monopolist. The Department of Justice sued for antitrust violations in 1949, a mere two years after the transistor's creation.</p><p>The breakup threat prompted AT&amp;T to drop the licensing prices for its patents, creating opportunity for other market entrants, including several from the Bell Labs transistor team who decamped to other companies, or struck out on their own. One, William Shockley, went to Palo Alto, Calif., sparking the silicon semiconductor industry that gave the Valley its name.</p><p>This was only the start. When the lawsuit was settled seven years later, AT&amp;T didn't have to break up or divest any of its major businesses. Nor did it have to stop its research operations. Instead, it had to share them. The government mandated AT&amp;T had to license its existing patents - including the transistor - free. Future inventions had to be licensed for a modest fee.</p><p>Opponents of the deal howled that the phone monopoly had gotten off with a slap on the wrist. AT&amp;T's leaders had to agree. \"The loss of royalties,\" a company spokesman declared, \"will not have a significant effect on the company's future revenues.\"</p><p>These revenues did matter for the future of Silicon Valley, however.</p><p>The settlement allowed the smallest of tech start-ups to license the most advanced technology. A fiercely competitive semiconductor industry bloomed, where companies had to come up with new and better products to compete in the market. If you wanted to point to a singular event that allowed the silicon chip business to \"really get started,\" reflected Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, it was the 1956 consent decree.</p><p>While AT&amp;T remained a cash-rich Goliath through the 1960s and 1970s, compulsory licensing and regulatory enforcement created space for plenty of tech and telecom Davids to grow: wireless communication, computer networking, telecom equipment. Further court decisions swatted away AT&amp;T's attempts to squash long-distance competitors and permitted the use of third-party equipment on its wires. \"That most monopolistic of all monopolies,\" noted the New York Times rather gleefully, \"is finally faced with the threat of competition.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the consent decree remained the gift that kept on giving. Bell Labs' patents fueled ever-more-advanced chipmaking that made it possible to shrink computers down to desktop size, then to connect them online.</p><p>Ironically, AT&amp;T's insatiable hunger to get a piece of the information age precipitated its breakup. The feds had filed a fresh antitrust suit in late 1974, charging that the Bell System was unfairly throttling its upstart competitors. To the dismay of company executives, the case pushed forward even after the arrival of the decidedly more pro-business Reagan administration - thanks to its newly appointed antitrust chief, Stanford law professor William F. Baxter.</p><p>Baxter was a staunch free-market conservative who believed government overreach was a far graver danger than corporate bigness. But he also was a Stanford alumnus whose more than 30 years on that campus had given him a front-row seat to Silicon Valley's information revolution. The government's case had merit, Baxter believed, and he vowed to litigate it \"to the eyeballs.\"</p><p>As tech-friendly Democrats in Congress turned up the heat as well, AT&amp;T was backed into a corner. The personal computer industry was booming, dial-up networking was starting to blossom and Ma Bell wanted in. But the government wasn't going to allow it.</p><p>So, in late 1982, AT&amp;T agreed to break itself up. The local carriers spun off into \"Baby Bells.\" Bell Labs became an independent company, Lucent. The AT&amp;T that remained made a play for the PC business, but didn't get very far. IBM, another company only recently released from antitrust enforcement's claws, had already cornered the market.</p><p>The settlement still placed limits on what the companies of the former Bell System could do. AT&amp;T couldn't get into the business of providing online news and information. Local carriers couldn't make and market telecom equipment. But once again, these regulatory guardrails created space for whole new industries to grow. Imagine how the tech story of the past 30 years might have played out without online service providers like CompuServe, Prodigy and AOL, networking hardware giants like Cisco or any of the thousands of companies that built the infrastructure and information platforms that enabled today's wired world.</p><p>In future-tense Silicon Valley, memory of this history is now largely lost. But it is critical to understanding how and why the industry grew in the first place. Antitrust enforcement of one very large, rich, innovative company opened up opportunities for many other firms to grow and thrive. The relentless competition among many once-small companies - from the semiconductor makers to the personal-computing home-brewers to the dot-coms and beyond - made Silicon Valley so remarkably good at producing one innovative generation after another.</p><p>Regulation didn't choke the big guys, either. The Bell System remained wildly profitable through its life as a regulated monopoly. Its deep pockets allowed it to become the industrial research laboratory for an entire set of industries - from chips and computers to networks and routers. AT&amp;T continued to deliver hefty returns to shareholders even after it had broken into pieces.</p><p>So bigness doesn't necessarily have to be badness. That is, as long as there are rules in place to allow small companies to grow along with the large, for the innovative resources of tech giants to be shared widely and for the government to step in when necessary.</p><p>Teddy Roosevelt, a champion of regulation more than he was a buster of trusts, said it best. \"Concentration and co-operation are conditions imperatively essential for industrial advance,\" TR declared in 1912, but \"there must be control in order to protect the people.\"</p><p>And as the case of AT&amp;T shows, control protects innovation, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-57da483ff1cb45398dcb5baebdce411b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ0-4HB1-JB4M-V0T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><timeReceived>10:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 10, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008OT5</classCode><className>BELL LABORATORIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

Yet, both supporters and opponents of antitrust regulations agree on one fundamental point-that effective competition is vital to the American economy and the welfare of its citizens. However, they differ in how the law should encourage this. There are essentially three schools of thought regarding antitrust policy:</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Interventionist</emphasis>. Regulators should use the law proactively to break up companies that are abusing their market power and restore a competitive market. The size of a company is a good guide as to when this should be done.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Consumer welfare</emphasis>. Abuse of market power is rare and dominant market positions can be achieved through delivering improvements in consumer welfare. Therefore, antitrust laws should be used not to break up companies that have grown big through successful competition, but to address instances of collusion, price fixing, or other anti-competitive behavior.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Free market</emphasis>. Antitrust law is unnecessary. Market processes routinely undermine monopolies-and attempts to create monopolies. Laws against \"unfair competition\" prevent property owners from experimenting with joint ventures and other innovations that can improve consumer welfare.<br/>Until recently, there was a sharp partisan divide between these schools, which can be roughly described as liberal, conservative, and libertarian, respectively. Traditionally in practice, this meant that antitrust conservatives would more often side with the libertarian camp, while leaving some room for cooperation with the liberal faction. However, the recent rise of \"big tech\" has led some conservatives to turn to the most interventionist approach with a zeal that threatens innovation in America's world-leading technology industry.<br/>The interventionist approach suffers from the same problems classical liberal economists have long identified with government interventions in markets.<br/>First, there is the \"knowledge problem\"-how do regulators know better than the market what the best market structure is?<br/>Then there are what are known as public choice considerations-regulators might exercise their powers to promote their own preferred policy positions. The very existence of those powers will lead to intense lobbying by regulated entities-both those seeking regulatory relief and those who benefit from entry barriers that limit competition from potential new entrants in a market.<br/>The consumer welfare approach also has problems. Retaining antitrust law as an option that may be used against entrepreneurs carries the same threat to innovation posed by the interventionist approach. For instance, politicians with an animus against certain companies may pressure regulators into opposing mergers involving those companies. Regulators assessing unfair competition will not be immune from the knowledge problem and public choice effects. Entrepreneurs, eager to avoid provoking antitrust enforcement actions, will be dissuaded from pursuing innovations that might run afoul of the law.<br/>The third approach, abolishing antitrust law, is extremely controversial. There is a widespread belief, among policy makers, the media, and the public, that without the threat of antitrust law, companies will disregard customer preferences, extract excessive profits, and kill off competitors. Yet there is no such thing as a dominant market position unless it is guaranteed by government. AOL, Borders, Blockbuster, Sears, Kodak, and many other firms once considered dominant in their markets have fallen as the result of competition, without any antitrust action.<br/>This process of creative destruction, succinctly described by the economist Joseph Schumpeter, is a major driver of the kind of innovation that helps raise living standards. It will surely continue unless, ironically, antitrust regulators gain too much power. Were that to happen, large firms will be tempted to reach accommodations with a government that restricts their activities in exchange for not being broken up. Those accommodations will usually include protections and guarantees that act as entry barriers against potential innovative challengers. The result will be less competition, fewer innovations, and lower consumer welfare.<br/>Creative destruction is the best answer to dominant market positions. Rather than use antitrust law aggressively, those who wish to see big companies fall quickly should instead work to end antitrust law. As for other barriers to creative destruction-for instance, financial regulations that make launching an initial public offering of stock prohibitively costly-increased competition can be achieved through deregulation in those other areas.<br/>Date:\u00a0Wednesday, November 14, 2018Image:\u00a0Subtitle:\u00a0Framing a Broken DebateExperts:\u00a0Iain MurrayPublication Type:\u00a0Web MemoIssues:\u00a0Antitrust and CompetitionRegulatory ReformTeaser:\u00a0<br/>Few economic concepts elicit such strong reactions as that of monopoly, and the policy intended to address it-antitrust regulations (called competition policy in the European Union).

However, they differ in how the law should encourage this.

In 2020, that means building not just a website but also an app - several of them, actually. You'll probably want clients for Mac and Windows, iOS and Android, the open web, and - if you're showing off - Linux. In some of these places, like the web, there is no cost for operating this service beyond building and hosting it. And in others, such as the Mac and iOS app stores, there is a significant cost: 30 percent of revenue generated from within the app. This is true even though Apple runs its own email platform, which is free but charges for extra storage, and gets to keep all that revenue for itself.</p><p><br/>The above is the situation now unfolding for Hey, a clever and genuinely original email platform released on Monday by the makers of Basecamp. (I wrote about it at some length for The Verge on Monday, because for me trying new productivity apps is a form of self-care.) Hey costs $99 a year, and you can only sign up and pay on its website. It managed to get its iOS app into the App Store. But then it tried to submit some bug fixes, and Apple informed the company that it had to begin taking signups on iOS - and give Apple a 30 percent cut of that revenue - or get kicked out of the store.<br/>The reason, writes David Pierce at Protocol, is \"rule 3.1.1 of Apple's guidelines for app developers, which says in essence that if you want people to be able to buy stuff in your app, you need to do it using Apple's payments system.\" The rule is not uniformly applied. If you make a music app, like Spotify, or a video app, like Netflix, you can force people to sign up on the web and Apple won't take a cut. And if you make certain other email apps, such as Newton (no relation to the author), you can put your app in the App Store even though you don't let people pay with an in-app purchase.<br/>On its face, Apple's policy enforcement here feels arbitrary and capricious - and, I suspect, it may become part of the antitrust investigations now underway against the company. Apple has a duopoly in the smartphone market with Google, and charges developers 30 percent of their revenue to compete with it in certain categories, such as email. I'm no lawyer, but that certainly sounds like a formidable barrier to entry - and one erected by a company that has $192.8 billion in cash it has no clear use for, to boot.<br/>Apple declined to comment on the decision, but told Pierce its mistake was in ever permitting Hey into the App Store to begin with. Still, you could imagine the company saying, look, if you don't want to pay the rent, just don't make an iOS app. But that's not feasible, says David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founder of Basecamp, in a Twitter message. \"That's exactly what monopolists always say! Take it or leave it! Because they KNOW you can't leave it.\"<br/>He went on:<br/>They can get to essentially extract any cut they want. They're under no market pressure to be competitive. This is Monopoly Squeezing 101.<br/>As I said in my testimony before congress, why is it that credit card processing fees hover in the 1.8-2.8% range, while Apple's App Store have sat steady at 30% on the high end? Because there's no competition! And they have a monopoly grip!<br/>There's zero impetus on Apple to lower prices, stop being abusive, or even enforce their own policies with any sense of consistency or justice.<br/>I was glad Heinemeier Hansson brought up justice, since it's at the heart of every content moderation decision - and whether an app gets to be in the App Store is a content moderation decision like any other. Often in this column I'll write about a controversial post on Facebook, or a controversial video on YouTube, and what makes people so mad is that they fundamentally have no recourse against the platform, even though for many of those people it has become their livelihood. It might be legal, but it doesn't feel just.<br/>The thing about anti-competitive behavior, though, is that it may be illegal.<br/>II.<br/>Spotify has at least one advantage over Hey, in that it can exist in the App Store even though it doesn't sell subscriptions there. Instead, if you want to subscribe to Spotify's premium service, you have to go to its website - a fact that, per App Store guidelines, the company is not allowed to advertise. Meanwhile, Apple offers a mediocre Spotify alternative, Apple Music, which it advertises throughout the operating system. (I've received several push notification advertisements inviting me to subscribe).<br/>Last May, Spotify filed a formal complaint against Apple with the European Union, alleging that Apple is harming consumers and stifling innovation via the 30 percent tax and other policies that raise barriers to competition. Competition is particularly difficult in the music industry, given that the lion's share of all revenue that they generate goes to the record labels that own the music. For Spotify, Apple's businesses could represent an existential threat. (Among other things, it has pushed Spotify to buy up the crown jewels of American podcasting, to reduce its head-to-head competition with Apple over music streaming.)<br/>In any case, on Tuesday the European Union heeded Spotify's call - and opened an antitrust investigation into Apple. Here's Tom Warren at The Verge:<br/>The first investigation will probe whether Apple has broken EU competition rules with its App Store policies, following complaints by Spotify and Rakuten over Apple's 30 percent cut on subscriptions and sales of ebooks through its App Store.<br/>\"We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers, for example with its music streaming service Apple Music or with Apple Books,\" says Margrethe Vestager, the head of the EU's antitrust division. \"I have therefore decided to take a close look at Apple's App Store rules and their compliance with EU competition rules.\"<br/>Vestager opened a concurrent second investigation against the company related to Apple Pay, over fears that the company's policies around which merchants are allowed to use phone payments are similarly anticompetitive.<br/>For its part, Apple was rather hilariously dismissive of the whole affair.<br/>\"It's disappointing the European Commission is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride, and don't want to play by the same rules as everyone else,\" says an Apple spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. \"We don't think that's right - we want to maintain a level playing field where anyone with determination and a great idea can succeed.\"<br/>The truth is that many, many developers complain about these policies - but precisely because they are so dependent on Apple, very few are willing to do so publicly. As for whether there is a level playing field, the idea that Apple charges people a 30 percent tax to compete with it in some categories but not others seems laughable on its face.<br/>III.<br/>By now we are more or less used to the European Union taking the lead in regulating the big tech companies. But since Democrats retook the House of Representatives in 2018, the United States has also shown a belated interest in competition, and some of those efforts are accelerating.<br/>One of the most significant developments on that front to date took place over the weekend, when Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee they are open to testifying about competition. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said he will testify as well. The apparent deal is that the CEOs will show up and testify as long as all of the other guys, do, too, so they can distribute the pain equally. (This will help ensure that the coverage is nicely generic - \"Congress yells at Big Tech\" - and not \"Congress yells at Jeff Bezos for some frankly pretty valid and specific reasons.)<br/>But one CEO has yet to confirm his attendance, and if you've read this far you can probably guess who. Here's Tony Romm in the Washington Post:<br/>Apple, meanwhile, told the committee that it would send a senior executive yet did not clearly commit its leader, Tim Cook, to appearing before lawmakers, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. That approach could ratchet up tensions between the iPhone giant and lawmakers in Washington.<br/>If nothing else, agreeing to go before Congress indicates that three of the four Big Tech CEOs feel comfortable defending themselves against charges of anticompetitive behavior. Given everything unfolding at the moment in Apple's domain, then, it is perhaps unsurprising that Tim Cook has been less willing to participate.<br/>Correction, 6/18: This article originally stated Superhuman does not enable in-app purchases iOS. It does, and has been removed from the article.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/>Trending sideways: Google banned far-right websites ZeroHedge and The Federalist from its ad platform over racist comments posted on the sites.

Here's Russell Brandom at The Verge:<br/>Dubbed \"Secondary Infektion,\" the campaign spanned a number of online platforms, beginning on the Russia-based LiveJournal in 2014, and moving to Twitter and YouTube later that year. In the years that followed, the campaign shifted to Reddit, Medium, and even the user-generated portion of BuzzFeed.

These warrants compel companies like Google to give up reams of data on who was in a certain location at a certain time.

It combines a TV screen, depth sensors, and AI-enabled camera to track employees' movements and give them feedback in real time. James Vincent at The Verge explains:<br/>Although these solutions will be necessary for workers to return to busy facilities like warehouses, many privacy experts worry their introduction will normalize greater levels of surveillance. Many of these solutions will produce detailed data of workers' movements throughout the day, allowing managers to hound employees in the name of productivity. Workers will also have no choice but to be tracked in this way if they want to keep their job.<br/>Amazon's involvement in this sort of technology will raise suspicions as the company is often criticized for the grueling working conditions in its facilities. In 2018, it even patented a wristband that would track workers' movements in real time, directing not just which task they should do next, but if their hands are moving towards the wrong shelf or bin.<br/>Instagram is set to overtake Twitter as the most popular news source, according to the 2020 Reuters Institute Digital News report.

Apple plans to incorporate some of Clue's core features this month such as fertility and period prediction into its own health app that will come pre-installed on all iPhones and is free, unlike Clue, which makes money by selling subscriptions and free in-app services. In the past <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">the incorporation of features in Apple, included in other applications, has led to third parties's demise.</emphasis><br/>The new threat posed by Clue shows how Apple plays a double game in the app economy: it provides access to independent apps and big competitors. \"It's a love-hate relationship, of course. You don't want to bother a milkman when you only have one milkman,\" said Clue CEO Ida Tin, who coined the term \"fem tech.\" However, Tin believes his Berlin-based company can co-exist with Apple. He said he highlights the \"distribution of biased power\" in the technology industry.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Developers have begun to accept that, without warning, Apple may make its work obsolete by adleting a new app or features that it uses or incorporates its ideas.</emphasis><br/>Some apps have simply given in to pressure, in some cases closing. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Generally, these companies don't sue Apple for the difficulty and cost of fighting a tech giant</emphasis> and the consequences they would have to face from being dependent on the platform. The power imbalance between Apple and independent apps is on the platform that could represent a fracture in the company's armor because <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">regulators and lawmakers put the dominance of the big tech companies under the microscope antitrust. </emphasis><br/>When Apple made flashlights part of its operating system in 2013. This instantly rumbled in many applications that offered that functionality. Everything from the \"Measure\" app included in Apple, to emoji animation was originally company-independent apps in the App Store.<br/>In September of this year the software will be updated, in addition to tracking the menstrual period, Apple added the option to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">use the iPad as a second computer screen, a feature that initially offered a popular app called Duet Display.</emphasis> IPhone and iPad keyboards will have the option to type by swiping, imitating apps like Switfkey and others.<br/>The misfortune of having an app copied by Apple even has an industrial term. \"Getting Sherlocked\" dates back to the time when Apple's desktop had a search tool called \"Sherlock\" borrowing several third-party features by the \"Watson\" companion tool, which no longer exists.<br/>Imitation is common in the technology<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">industry. \"We've always been shameless to steal ideas,\" Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once said.</emphasis> But what makes Apple's practice different is that it has access to a treasure trove of data that no one else<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">owns. App Store,</emphasis>where original apps are offered and you compete for downloads, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">collects a lot of information</emphasis> about what kind of apps are successful, even how much time users spend in the app.<br/>This informationit is widely shared by leaders of the tech giants and could be used to make strategic decisions about developed products, said Philip Shoemaker, who worked as Apple's App Store director from 2009 to 2016. \"I think Apple takes inspiration for apps that are in the Apps Store,\" he said. \"Healthy competition, in every category, drives everyone who makes apps, including Apple, to improve.\" Fred Sainz said Apple spokesman in a statement. \"We had no other way, because it's how our users have the best experience possible.\" He added that the App Store has more than 2 million apps, showing \"that a good idea can come from anywhere and touch people's lives anywhere.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The titans of technology are not only powerful because they are large or profitable. They are also omniscient governors of their platforms,</emphasis>able to use the information of smaller competitors for their own advantage and expand their reach through functionality enhancements.<br/>When companies sell their products to Amazon, for example, the retail giant can see before any other if a new category is successful. Similarly Apple benefits from the inventiveness of millions of app developers, first when its apps encourage consumers to continue using iPhones- and another if Apple takes its most successful ideas and copies them. And when apps collect payments, Apple gets 15 or 30%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Technology platforms such as Apple and Amazon can use information that \"identifies potential threats and then acquires is threatened and then finds a way to put it at a disadvantage,\" said Maurice Srucke,</emphasis>a professor at the SCHOOL of Law University of Tennessee and author of several books on antitrust policy. Once Apple duplicates the idea behind an app, the internal version gets benefits of functionality that third-party developers don't have access to.<br/>Apple Music, for example, is the only streaming service that is allowed to make the most of Siri. Apple said it plans to change this policy on its new operating system, i0S 13. Apple's walkie talkie app, which was released after a standalone app proved the appeal of the concept, is the only one that can operate with Apple Watch.<br/>For mobile app developers, it's hard to avoid<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple. Apple is responsible for 71% of all revenue generated in the United States by mobile apps,</emphasis>according to Sensor Tower, a market research firm. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ignore Apple</emphasis> (the only alternative is Google-Owner of Android) <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">it's equivalent to failure.</emphasis> But when it comes to copying apps, Apple's big advantage over the years is the ability to offer many of them at no extra charge, the cost is included in the phone price itself.<br/>Apple itself creates more than 40 apps, a number that continually increases over the years as a company that has driven new ideas. Many come pre-installed on iPhone. In a climate of unprecedented scrutiny of the power of big tech companies, some wonder whether creating Apple apps that mimic others that exist on their platform, aided by the information market it collects from them, could be harmful could be harmful competition and damage<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">innovation. The senator, Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, is focusing on the App Store at this year's start. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They can't do the two at the same time,\" he told The Verge.</emphasis> The Department of Justice is reviewing Apple and other tech giants for possible monopoly violations.<br/>Leading another investigation is Rep. David Cicilline, D.R.I. Presidentjudicial subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law of the House of Representatives. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The music app, Spotify, filed a complaint either year, claiming unfair competition in the App Store for giving Apple Music an edge.</emphasis> The copy of technology has troubled the tech giants, two decades ago 20 states sued Microsoft, whose operation of the Windows system was dominant at the time, then Microsoft copied the Netscape web browser and made its own version, Internet Explorer, the default option in Windows. Microsoft solved the case. Kyle Andeer, Apple's corporate vice president of law, speaking at a Justice Chamber hearing in July, said only a small number of apps in the App Store were made by Apple. \"In every category where our software competes, we face strong competitors,\" he said.<br/>This dynamic is at the heart of another antitrust storm showaround <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon, which is being investigated in Europe allegedly for using data generated by products sold in the store to determine which ones to copy and sell under private brands such as AmazonBasics</emphasis>. \"We are fully cooperating with the European Commission and we are working hard to maintain the business of all sizes and help them grow,\" Amazon said in a statement. In the same month of July during a congressional hearing, lawmakers questioned Amazon about whether a road map can use that data to duplicate products under more than 80 private brands it uses to sell everything from batteries to polo shirts , eating the profits of the sellers who helped make Amazon a successful platform.<br/>Nate Sutton, the general counsel associated with Amazon for general competition, denied that the company used this data for that purpose. (Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) At first, the only software allowed to be installed on iPhone was that of Apple. A year after the phone's launch in 2007, Apple opened up to third parties to build new programs for the phone. One of the first to develop applications was <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DoApp, a small developer company in Minnesota.</emphasis>DoApp manipulated the iPhone screen\u2014and then the flash\u2014so that it could be used as a light. Called <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MyLite, the app was free and ad-supported.</emphasis> It was very popular for its functionality and earned the honor of being in the first batch of iPhone apps. While the app had hundreds of copies, DoApps was at the forefront and continued to earn between $10,000 and $30,000 per month, revenue that allowed the company to experiment and innovate new ideas like new apps and games.<br/>In 2013, for a time myLite had more than 10 million people using it each month, DoApp sent a software engineer to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in Silicon Valley, as it did iPhones, iPads and other Apple products, Apple unveils new software that the audience presents. At that year's event, Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, showed a new feature that users can access by swiping up the button without even unlocking it. \"Turn on airplane mode, adjust the brightness, play a song, even turn on a literna,\" he said. \"if you wake up in the middle of the night and you need to find something, your flashlight is right there.\" At the hearing, former Vice President Al Gore, a board member nodded approvingly. \"I think that's where our model goes,\" Wade Beavers, CEO of DoApp, thought as he watched the announcement.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">After that, over the course of several months the gains of myLite \"cooled to</emphasis>zero,\" Beavers said. It was bad news for all the flashlight apps. DoApp continued to develop apps before selling the company in 2016. Beavers is now an angel investor venture capital advisor for technology companies, but said he would not invent any company that would create mobile apps. \"Ten years later, Apple is doing the same,\" he said. The decisions about which applications to develop are strategic and make the company's highest rungs, according to people familiar with how Apple works.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">App developers need to submit their ideas to Apple to be approved before they allow entry into the store, and Shoemaker runs the team that decides which ones are in and rejected.</emphasis>\u00a0 Shoemaker noted that while working at Apple, his department was careful not to share information about the apps submitted for review.<br/>Shoemaker doesn't want to create the perception that Apple could take ideas from developers before their apps are in store. Top Apple executives could still take a look at the apps under review, Showmaker said. But once a third-party app is accepted into the App Store, those barriers are removed. Apple has data on how they <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">are used and how long these barriers are used\u2014 the most valuable metric, Shoemaker said.</emphasis> Data aggregated by hundreds of millions of users, he said, was \"critical\" in determining what kind of apps were worth being inspired and<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">when. He said Apple's top executives could pull the popularity metric from apps like Facebook.</emphasis> Shoemaker said he constantly receives emails from angry app developers because the company hadn't accepted their app, because they had killed their app by copying it. He said he'd send him to Apple's legal team.<br/>Apple has been able to set rules about which apps can give advantage to their own versions, the developers said. Several companies have offered walkie talkie apps for iPhone for several years, proving that people could use them on their phones in different ways. One of them, Voxer, wanted to integrate that functionality into Apple Watch, founder Tom Katis said, but Apple didn't allow any other walkie talkie app on Apple Watch.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In the last year, Apple released its own version of a walkie talkie feature on Apple Watch, mimicking some of the features of existing apps.</emphasis> Katis said she believes other companies could create better versions, allowed herto try. Apple was recently forced to temporarily turn off the walkie talkie app because of an error that breached security. \"It would be super cool to have a current walkie talkie who works well on Apple Watch,\" Katis said, adding that she has no ill will towards Apple.<br/>Apple created the \"Shortcuts\" app, which allows iPhone users to create custom automations, enjoy the same advantages as external competitors. Previous apps like IFTTT (If This, Then That) do not have the same level of access to Apple's operating system and cannot work as well.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Linden Tibbets, chief executive of IFTTT, said Apple is doing what all the dominant companies with their own platforms do eventually: copying the \"most successful apps\" and subsuming them into their operating system.</emphasis> This June, Natalia Zarawska, an i0S developer for Clue, traveled from Berlin to Silicon Valley for the World Developers Conference. She said that when Apple announced the new menstrual period tracking features in the health app, she was the first surprised and also a little angry. Other developers began to offer their condolences. Zarawska said thatApple developers, who taught, told him they loved Clue and asked for advice and help developing new features of the app. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">But they didn't answer Zarawska's most important question: Could Clue access the new women's health data that the revamped Apple app would have?</emphasis><br/>It's always a risk for a big company to copy you, said Rahul Dewan, the founder of Duet Display, an app that returns to the iPad on a second Mac or Windows screen at a cost of $9.99. Apple announced in June that they themselves are introducing this feature as part of the upcoming software update\u2014a copy that Dewan, apple's former employee, said they had planned for additional features. He's seen Apple do this with other apps. \"The only constant thing in technology is change,\" he said.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alaric Cole, a prolific app developer, said he had seen many of his ideas built into Apple's own software,</emphasis>posted in a blog post titled \"Apple Literally Stole My Thunder\" that in 2013 Apple had incorporated some of its ideas in its weather app. But Apple's copies didn't stop. Cole's \"Penboard\" app, which allowed people to write notes directly on iMessages, was copied a year later. Apple announced that it was launching that feature directly on iMessage, effectively killing Penboard. \"It's a shame for me because I liked AppStore,\" Cole said. \"But yes, I think they've been abusing their place.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8429010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X09-YFC1-DY1R-B0FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Apple's most important contribution to mankind ultimately may be revolutionizing the world of health care.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least that's what Chief Executive Tim Cook told a TV interviewer this year. What he didn't say, though, was how the Apple privacy policy could play a big role in its health care push. Nor did he say what pitfalls might lurk with the thorny issue of data privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple holds itself up as a rare guardian of consumers' personal data.\u00a0IPhone users can block web cookies that track them for targeted advertising.\u00a0The company resists sharing users' encrypted data with law enforcement. And Apple doesn't store their health care data on its own servers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Apple privacy policy has helped the company forge relationships with hospitals and medical researchers\u00a0to build a new electronic health record, or EHR, system.\u00a0 Other Apple health products include the iPhone Health App and health monitoring features on the Apple Watch. These health initiatives reflect a relatively new focus and area of potential growth for Apple.</p><p>Other big tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet's Google among them \u2014 have launched their own health care projects. Their moves come as data analytics in health care promise to detect the onset of diseases and save lives.</p><h>Apple Privacy Policy: A Deft Move Amid Growing Concerns</h><p>Yet concern is growing over data privacy and misuse as mobile phone apps and wearable devices suck up information. Do consumers want their heart rate history recorded on a smartwatch or lab results from a hospital visit to be shared with advertisers or, say, a life insurance company? Probably not.</p><p>So Apple's recent move to brand itself as a champion of consumer privacy seems a deft move.</p><p>\"There's something big at play around the opportunity in health care,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures. \"If the future of health care is more proactive and progresses toward wearable devices, then the question is which companies are best positioned.</p><p>\"I think the privacy angle, its perspective on privacy, gives Apple a big head start,\" he said.</p><p>Consumers might think existing health privacy laws limit the sharing of electronic health data. But\u00a0Apple and other tech companies skirt costly compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA.</p><p>The act governs how hospitals, doctors and insurers must protect patient privacy. But it doesn't address how tech companies collect health data. Nor does it regulate what they can do with it unless they are a business associate of a health care company.</p><h>Using Data For Digital Marketing</h><p>Just like consumer online behavior is tracked for targeted advertising, health data can be used for digital marketing.</p><p>\"Many consumers will be greatly surprised to learn how much of their health information is outside of HIPAA's coverage,\" said Peter Swire, the former White House coordinator for the HIPAA privacy rule under President Bill Clinton.</p><p>\"Most apps and consumer-facing software are not covered by HIPAA,\" added Swire, now a privacy expert at Georgia Tech. \"The individual is simply contacting an app developer and that is disconnected from the health payment system. So HIPAA doesn't apply.\"</p><p>The Apple privacy policy comes with rigid adherence, the company insists. The iPhone maker says it\u00a0has not collected any consumer data through its Health App for business purposes.</p><p>A fast-growing number of hospitals are working with Apple on the EHR system. And Apple health care products continue to improve. The first Apple Watch sold in 2015 measured heartbeats. The newest Apple Watch provides a type of electrocardiogram.</p><h>Race To Create Wearables</h><p>Apple,\u00a0Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences unit and other high-tech companies are racing to create wearable devices that capture biomarkers associated with diseases. A Verily smartwatch, for instance, aims to collect neurological data that could detect the onset of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Munster, a former Wall Street analyst, sees a chance that new federal data privacy legislation could address wearables and other health devices. That's why\u00a0the Apple privacy policy could give the Cupertino, Calif., company an edge, he says.</p><p>Apple has branded itself as the privacy company in high tech as Facebook, Google and others face a regulatory crackdown on targeted advertising. At January's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, an Apple billboard boasted: \"What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.\"</p><p>In March,\u00a0Apple began running its first iPhone TV commercials focused on privacy. The ad's tagline: \"If privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on.\"</p><h>Apple Privacy Policy: Concerns Growing</h><p>Apple's health care push comes as concerns grow about gaps in privacy laws governing health information.</p><p>Apple itself may not be involved in health marketing or working with data brokers. But third-party apps available at the Apple Store, as well as mobile devices using Google's Android software, lie in the HIPAA-free zone.</p><p>The same goes for. That data can include information on ovulation, heart rates, alcohol consumption and other sensitive material. Much of it comes from mobile apps without user consent, according to the Wall Street Journal. New York Gov. Andrew .</p><p>Congress passed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, known as the HITECH Act, in 2009. It provided incentives for health care providers to upgrade from paper medical records to digital.\u00a0But little was done to improve data privacy.</p><h>'Wild West' Environment In Data Privacy</h><p>Marc Albanese, director of health care research at CB Insights, says it's a \"Wild West\" environment now.</p><p>\"There are apps that have you put in a lot of information. You don't know who is monitoring the data,\" Albanese told IBD. \"And, there are some wide-open gaps where HIPAA doesn't apply. It comes down to whether you trust the app.\"</p><p>Albanese credits the Apple privacy policy with winning over incumbents in the health care industry.</p><p>\"Hospitals are trusting enough of Apple to have this EHR interface that allows people to download their medical records to their phone,\" Albanese said. \"But there are protections in place. Nothing goes to Apple servers. And, there isn't a HIPAA relationship. Apple isn't considered a business associate.\"</p><p>If customers download their own medical records to Apple's iCloud, a remote data storage system, data is encrypted.</p><p>In a key move, Apple in 2016 bought personal health startup Gliimpse. Apple used Gliimpse's technology to build a platform where consumers can manage and share their medical records.</p><h>Apple Privacy Policy: Getting Health Care Involved</h><p>Over 120 health care institutions are now part of the Apple project in EHR.</p><p>Apple designed its EHR platform to pull in data from hospitals using the new Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, standard. IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, Amazon\u00a0and Google have committed to using the FHIR standard.</p><p>Google in November hired David Feinberg, chief executive of Geisinger Health System, to oversee its health care initiatives. He reports to Google's Jeff Dean, who leads the \u00a0division.</p><p>Google's Verily unit in January raised $1 billion from private equity firm Silver Lake and other investors. One Verily initiative is Project Baseline, a partnership with Duke University and Stanford Medicine. They plan to collect data on 10,000 people through blood tests, sleep sensors and other means. Their goal is to identify health risks and better understand disease onset.</p><p>In Ohio, Verily has partnered with health care providers to bring a data-driven approach to battling opioid addiction.</p><p>Google partnered with the University of Chicago Medical Center in 2017, meanwhile, to create predictive models for preventing unneeded hospital re-admissions.</p><p>A new  that could identify patients.</p><h>Amazon's Move</h><p>Then there's Amazon. It reportedly has a health project called \"Grand Challenge\" based in Seattle. It's using artificial intelligence to analyze medical records.</p><p>Amazon acquired online pharmacy PillPack in mid-2018. The year before, it\u00a0invested in Grail, a cancer-detection startup.</p><p>And in early 2018 Amazon formed a health care joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway.\u00a0They've hired away a UnitedHealth Group executive to head product strategy and research.\u00a0In early March, Amazon and Berkshire gave the joint venture a name \u2014 Haven.</p><p>Amazon also announced Thursday that it's partnering with six health-care providers to make its  HIPAA-compliant. The partners include Cigna and its pharmacy benefit management subsidiary, Express Scripts.</p><p>Alexa is the heart of Amazon's Echo-branded smart home systems. Amazon says Alexa users will be able to make doctor appointments and check their health data.</p><p>The current wave of smartwatches and other wearables\u00a0is just the start, say observers. Apple has patented versions of AirPod wireless earbuds with health applications. \u00a0aim to detect things like stress.  are on the way.</p><p>Meanwhile, more cracks are appearing in HIPAA, now more than 20 years old.</p><h>Unwittingly Sharing Data</h><p>Joseph Turow, communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says Americans unwittingly share private health data online.</p><p>\"People don't really know that when they go to a site like WebMD and click on a particular ad that they are giving away their name to a particular disease,\" Turow told IBD. \"I think many people feel that HIPAA covers all this stuff and it doesn't.</p><p>\"Most Americans have very little understanding about how data mining works,\" Turow said. \"They just don't know so much information related to their health can be streaming around the internet.\"</p><p>It's unclear, though, whether any federal data privacy legislation will update HIPAA rules for the digital age.</p><p>Europe and California have stiffened consumer data privacy rules. Europe enacted its General Data Protection Regulation last year, enabling consumers to edit, add or delete data that has been collected. The California Consumer Privacy Act takes effect in 2020. It grants consumers the right to know what information is collected by companies and how it's shared.</p><p>And the backlash continues from , in which the consulting firm accessed users' personal data and used it for political purposes. Analysts speculate that even a divided U.S. Congress could pass federal data privacy legislation before the 2020 election.</p><h>Data Privacy Legislation Targeting Tech</h><p>Any legislation most likely would target Facebook, Google and other tech giants that gather consumer data.</p><p>Apple's Cook in January said any federal legislation should also target data brokers, who he says should have to register with the Federal Trade Commission. Taking aim at high-tech and telecom rivals, Cook criticized the \"shadow economy\" that profits from consumer data.</p><p>The problem is that Big Data business models are exploding in many industries, not just digital advertising. Health care, financial services and retail are among them.</p><p>\"Data underlies nearly every industry today,\" said Ashkan Soltani, formerly chief technologist for the Federal Trade Commission. Soltani helped develop California's new privacy rules.</p><p>\"Companies have started to realize that there is this abundance of currently free, unregulated resource called 'data' which can possibly help to improve their business processes, if not simply just provide an alternate revenue stream.</p><p>\"Nearly every sector has some interest in being able to have unfettered access to user data. In the long term, that could prove disastrous for both consumers and industry due to insecurity and lack of trust in the marketplace.\"</p><p>Google in May fired back at Apple's posturing on privacy issues. At a developer's conference, CEO Sundar Pichai said: \"We know our work on privacy and security is never done and we want to do more to stay ahead.\"\u00a0He added Google will put limits on cookies that track internet users.</p><p>In a recent New York Times commentary piece, Pichai took a veiled shot at Apple. He said \"privacy cannot be a luxury good\" that's only available to \"people who can afford to buy premium products and services.\"\u00a0Pichai added that he supports federal privacy legislation.</p><h>Leveling Data-Privacy Playing Field</h><p>Christine Lyon, a partner at Washington, D.C., law firm Morrison &amp; Foerster, says new federal data privacy legislation could level the playing field across industries. She says tech companies, banks and retailers may be required to play by the same rules as health care providers.</p><p>\"Different companies handling the same kind of data may have very different regulatory obligations,\" she said. \"Now that we are looking more seriously at federal legislation, one outcome could be a baseline level of privacy protection rather than a very industry-specific approach.\"</p><p>For Apple, the stakes are high.

Regulators have taken notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Twelve years ago, Apple introduced the App Store, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">a peculiar online marketplace</url> for the year-old iPhone. It had 500 offerings.

And Apple still takes 30 percent of many apps\u2019 sales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That commission has proved hugely consequential for Apple. It has been the primary driver of growth in recent years for a company that has nearly $275 billion in annual sales. And it has created some of Apple\u2019s biggest headaches, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">drawing antitrust scrutiny</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">fury from app makers</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">lawsuits from consumers and partners</url>.</p><p>The headaches intensified this week when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite</url>, arguably the world\u2019s most popular video game, sued both Apple and Google, accusing the companies of breaking antitrust laws by forcing app makers to pay their 30 percent fees. The lawsuits followed Apple and Google\u2019s removal of Fortnite from their app stores because Epic encouraged users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google, to avoid their fees.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re realizing that 30 percent is way too much,\u201d said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3 percent to process payments. \u201cIt should be closer to that,\u201d he said.</p><p>That is the rising sentiment among app developers, consumers and regulators. Apple and Google, which together are worth more than $3 trillion, make the software that backs virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones. That dominance has allowed them to keep their commissions high.</p><p>But now that the tech giants\u2019 smartphones have become the only way other businesses reach millions of people, those businesses are increasingly pleading: Do you really need a third of my sales?</p><p>\u201cThere are very few companies out there that have a 30 percent profit margin,\u201d said Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail, an email service. \u201cThe only way we can support this fee is by passing that cost on to customers.\u201d ProtonMail charges 30 percent less for subscriptions purchased on its website, but when the company advertised that to its iPhone users, Apple restricted its app.</p><p>Likewise, Spotify increased its monthly subscription to $13 from $10 in 2014 to account for Apple\u2019s fee. A year later, Apple introduced a competing music service \u2014 priced at $10. To compete, Spotify opted out of Apple\u2019s payment system, enabling it to avoid the commission. Now customers can still use Spotify\u2019s app, but they must subscribe on Spotify\u2019s website. Yet Apple bars Spotify from saying that in its iPhone app.</p><p>\u201cEither we lose because we have to pay them a 30 percent tax just to operate and raise our prices for consumers as a result, or we lose because it becomes much more expensive to convert users from free to premium,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters in June after European regulators <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">opened an antitrust investigation</url> into Apple based on Spotify\u2019s complaint.</p><p>Even consumers have spoken up. An enormous <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">class-action lawsuit</url> accuses Apple of breaking antitrust laws to enforce its commission, inflating app prices for iPhone users. The Supreme Court ruled last year the lawsuit could proceed.</p><p>On Friday, Facebook chimed in, complaining that Apple is collecting 30 percent of sales on its new live-events service, where people can sell expert talks, fitness classes and cooking tutorials on Facebook\u2019s app. Facebook said it wanted to process the payments itself so it could pass on 100 percent of the sales to the small businesses selling the talks and classes, but Apple declined.</p><p>Apple argues that it has actually cut software developers a break. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">suggested to Congress</url> last month that when software was still sold in brick-and-mortar stores, 50 percent to 70 percent of the retail price went to middlemen.</p><p>\u201cIn the more than a decade since the App Store debuted, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThe App Store evolves with the times, and every change we have made has been in the direction of providing a better experience for our users and a compelling business opportunity for developers.\u201d</p><p>For Google, the stakes are lower. It allows people to download apps from outside of its Android app store, meaning app makers like Epic have ample ways to still reach consumers using Android devices. And Google\u2019s vast online advertising business makes its app store a much smaller portion of its overall business.</p><p>Over the past year, Apple has collected $19 billion of the $63.4 billion in sales of digital goods and services on iPhone and iPad apps, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Google collected $10 billion of the $33.8 billion in similar spending on its app store, Sensor Tower said.</p><p>Before Mr. Cook\u2019s testimony to Congress, at a House hearing focused on the power of Big Tech, Apple commissioned <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">a study</url> that showed its cut was in line with what many other platforms charged for similar distribution, including the app stores from Google, Microsoft and Samsung, and the game stores from Nintendo, Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s Twitch gaming platform collects 50 percent, according to the study. By comparison, Amazon, eBay and Walmart charge 6 percent to 17 percent for sales of goods on their websites, the study said.</p><p>What the study didn\u2019t note: Apple popularized the 30 percent cut.</p><p>It applied that rate on any purchases of an app in 2008, and then a year later on any transactions inside of apps for digital goods and services, such as a virtual currency in a game or a subscription to a music, TV or dating app. Apple does not take a cut of apps\u2019 sales of advertising or physicals goods, and thus most apps don\u2019t pay a fee.</p><p>So how did Apple arrive at 30 percent?</p><p>There was some precedent; Apple had been charging roughly the same commission on music sales on its iTunes software. For each 99 cent song it sold, Apple passed on 72 cents to major music labels and 62 cents to independent labels, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">according to The Wall Street Journal</url> in 2007.</p><p>When Apple began setting rules for the App Store, \u201c30 percent was just kind of a no-brainer,\u201d said Mr. Shoemaker, who joined the company in early 2009. \u201cIt was, \u2018Of course that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use.\u2019 Nobody questioned it.\u201d</p><p>In 2008, when Apple introduced the App Store, the company\u2019s late co-founder Steve Jobs <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">told The New York Times</url>: \u201cWe are not trying to be business partners\u201d with app developers. Rather, he added, Apple wanted to \u201csell more iPhones.\u201d</p><p>At the time, there was far less pushback from app developers, in part because the App Store was so nascent and the digital transactions were complicated without Apple\u2019s help.</p><p>With Apple, \u201cit was pretty much one click and that was revolutionary,\u201d Mr. Shoemaker said. \u201cSo people were willing to bite that 30 percent. But now, those kinds of tools are a dime a dozen.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, many companies now protesting Apple\u2019s fee seem willing to pay something, just not 30 percent.</p><p>Epic made $1.8 billion on Fortnite last year, in large part by selling digital currency that players need to buy new features inside the game. The game itself is free.</p><p>On Thursday, Epic started its confrontation with the tech giants by allowing Fortnite users to pay it directly in its iPhone and Android apps, rather than via Apple or Google\u2019s payment systems.</p><p>Epic also offered a 20 percent discount on all purchases that used its payment system. That meant that if Apple and Google charged a 10 percent commission, their price would be about the same as the one Epic was offering its customers.</p><p>Epic has also shown that running a profitable app store is possible with a lower commission. It runs its own online marketplace for other developers to distribute their games on desktop computers. In that store, it takes 12 percent of sales \u2014 and still makes a profit of 5 percent to 7 percent, the company said.</p><p>Yet at Apple, the discussion has long been about how to maximize profits. In 2011, Apple executives were discussing how much to charge content providers like Hulu and the NBA for new customers who signed up via Apple TV, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/technology/personaltech/10apps.html\">internal emails</url> provided to House lawmakers investigating Apple.</p><p>Jai Chulani, one Apple executive, said in an email to colleagues that he worried that if Apple charged 30 percent of the first year of a subscription \u201cwe may be leaving money on the table.\u201d</p><p>Eddy Cue, one of Apple\u2019s most senior executives, responded with a better idea: \u201cFor recurring subscriptions, we should ask for 40%.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Apple\u2019s App Store has become a major part of the company\u2019s business in recent years, facilitating half a trillion dollars in sales last year alone.

H...</p><p>An Apple store in New York, Sept. 19, 2019. Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, arguably the world\u2019s most popular video game, sued both Apple and Google, accusing the companies of breaking antitrust laws by forcing app makers to pay their 30 percent fees. Haruka Sakaguchi, The New York Times/File     OAKLAND, California \u2014 Twelve years ago, Apple introduced the App Store, a peculiar online marketplace for the year-old iPhone. It had 500 offerings. Apple told app makers it would take a 30 percent cut of their sales, and few complained.    Today, the App Store is one of the world\u2019s largest centers of commerce, facilitating half a trillion dollars in sales last year alone. And Apple still takes 30 percent of many apps\u2019 sales.    That commission has proved hugely consequential for Apple. It has been the primary driver of growth in recent years for a company that has nearly $275 billion in annual sales. And it has created some of Apple\u2019s biggest headaches, drawing antitrust scrutiny, fury from app makers and lawsuits from consumers and partners.    The headaches intensified this week when Epic Games, the maker of \u201cFortnite,\u201d arguably the world\u2019s most popular video game, sued both Apple and Google, accusing the companies of breaking antitrust laws by forcing app makers to pay their 30 percent fees. The lawsuits followed Apple and Google\u2019s removal of \u201cFortnite\u201d from their app stores because Epic encouraged users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google, to avoid their fees.    \u201cI think we\u2019re realizing that 30% is way too much,\u201d said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3 percent to process payments. \u201cIt should be closer to that,\u201d he said.    That is the rising sentiment among app developers, consumers and regulators. Apple and Google, which together are worth more than $3 trillion, make the software that backs virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones. That dominance has allowed them to keep their commissions high.    But now that the tech giants\u2019 smartphones have become the only way other businesses reach millions of people, those businesses are increasingly pleading: Do you really need a third of my sales?    \u201cThere are very few companies out there that have a 30 percent profit margin,\u201d said Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail, an email service. \u201cThe only way we can support this fee is by passing that cost on to customers.\u201d ProtonMail charges 30 percent less for subscriptions purchased on its website, but when the company advertised that to its iPhone users, Apple restricted its app.    Likewise, Spotify increased its monthly subscription to $13 from $10 in 2014 to account for Apple\u2019s fee. A year later, Apple introduced a competing music service \u2014 priced at $10. To compete, Spotify opted out of Apple\u2019s payment system, enabling it to avoid the commission. Now customers can still use Spotify\u2019s app, but they must subscribe on Spotify\u2019s website. Yet Apple bars Spotify from saying that in its iPhone app.    \u201cEither we lose because we have to pay them a 30 percent tax just to operate and raise our prices for consumers as a result, or we lose because it becomes much more expensive to convert users from free to premium,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters in June after European regulators opened an antitrust investigation into Apple based on Spotify\u2019s complaint.    Even consumers have spoken up. An enormous class-action lawsuit accuses Apple of breaking antitrust laws to enforce its commission, inflating app prices for iPhone users. The Supreme Court ruled last year the lawsuit could proceed.    On Friday, Facebook chimed in, complaining that Apple is collecting 30 percent of sales on its new live-events service, where people can sell expert talks, fitness classes and cooking tutorials on Facebook\u2019s app. Facebook said it wanted to process the payments itself so it could pass on 100 percent of the sales to the small businesses selling the talks and classes, but Apple declined.    Apple argues that it has actually cut software developers a break. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, suggested to Congress last month that when software was still sold in brick-and-mortar stores, 50 percent to 70 percent of the retail price went to middlemen.    \u201cIn the more than a decade since the App Store debuted, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThe App Store evolves with the times, and every change we have made has been in the direction of providing a better experience for our users and a compelling business opportunity for developers.\u201d    For Google, the stakes are lower. It allows people to download apps from outside its Android app store, meaning app makers like Epic have ample ways to still reach consumers using Android devices. And Google\u2019s vast online advertising business makes its app store a much smaller portion of its overall business.    Over the past year, Apple has collected $19 billion of the $63.4 billion in sales of digital goods and services on iPhone and iPad apps, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Google collected $10 billion of the $33.8 billion in similar spending on its app store, Sensor Tower said.    Before Cook\u2019s testimony to Congress, at a House hearing focused on the power of Big Tech, Apple commissioned a study that showed its cut was in line with what many other platforms charged for similar distribution, including the app stores from Google, Microsoft and Samsung, and the game stores from Nintendo, Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox.    Amazon\u2019s Twitch gaming platform collects 50 percent, according to the study. By comparison, Amazon, eBay and Walmart charge 6 percent to 17 percent for sales of goods on their websites, the study said.    What the study didn\u2019t note: Apple popularized the 30 percent cut.    It applied that rate on any purchases of an app in 2008, and then a year later on any transactions inside of apps for digital goods and services, such as a virtual currency in a game or a subscription to a music, TV or dating app. Apple does not take a cut of apps\u2019 sales of advertising or physicals goods, and thus most apps don\u2019t pay a fee.    Epic made $1.8 billion on \u201cFortnite\u201d last year, in large part by selling digital currency that players need to buy new features inside the game. The game itself is free.    On Thursday, Epic started its confrontation with the tech giants by allowing \u201cFortnite\u201d users to pay it directly in its iPhone and Android apps, rather than via Apple or Google\u2019s payment systems.    Epic also offered a 20 percent discount on all purchases that used its payment system. That meant that if Apple and Google charged a 10 percent commission, their price would be about the same as the one Epic was offering its customers.    Jai Chulani, one Apple executive, said in an email to colleagues that he worried that if Apple charged 30 percent of the first year of a subscription \u201cwe may be leaving money on the table.\u201d    Eddy Cue, one of Apple\u2019s most senior executives, responded with a better idea: \u201cFor recurring subscriptions, we should ask for 40 percent.\u201d    \u00a9 The New York Times Company</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42879589613</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MR-H721-JCSC-J186-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1247\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>ABS-CBN News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apple told app makers it would take a 30% cut of their sales, and few complained.  Today, the App Store is one of the world\u2019s largest centres of commerce, facilitating half a trillion dollars in sales last year alone. And Apple still takes 30% of many apps\u2019 sales.  That commission has proved hugely consequential for Apple. It has been the primary driver of growth in recent years for a company that has nearly $275 billion in annual sales. And it has created some of Apple\u2019s biggest headaches, drawing antitrust scrutiny, fury from app makers and lawsuits from consumers and partners.  The headaches intensified this week when Epic Games, the maker of \"Fortnite,\" arguably the world\u2019s most popular video game, sued both Apple and Google, accusing the companies of breaking antitrust laws by forcing app makers to pay their 30% fees. The lawsuits followed Apple and Google\u2019s removal of \"Fortnite\" from their app stores because Epic encouraged users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google, to avoid their fees.  \"I think we\u2019re realizing that 30% is way too much,\" said Phillip Shoemaker, a former senior App Store executive, who left Apple in 2016. Credit card companies charge roughly 3% to process payments. \"It should be closer to that,\" he said.  That is the rising sentiment among app developers, consumers and regulators. Apple and Google, which together are worth more than $3 trillion, make the software that backs virtually all of the world\u2019s smartphones. That dominance has allowed them to keep their commissions high.  But now that the tech giants\u2019 smartphones have become the only way other businesses reach millions of people, those businesses are increasingly pleading: Do you really need a third of my sales?  \"There are very few companies out there that have a 30% profit margin,\" said Andy Yen, the chief executive of ProtonMail, an email service. \"The only way we can support this fee is bypassing that cost on to customers.\" ProtonMail charges 30% less for subscriptions purchased on its website, but when the company advertised that to its iPhone users, Apple restricted its app.  Likewise, Spotify increased its monthly subscription to $13 from $10 in 2014 to account for Apple\u2019s fee. A year later, Apple introduced a competing music service \u2014 priced at $10. To compete, Spotify opted out of Apple\u2019s payment system, enabling it to avoid the commission. Now customers can still use Spotify\u2019s app, but they must subscribe on Spotify\u2019s website. Yet Apple bars Spotify from saying that in its iPhone app.  \"Either we lose because we have to pay them a 30% tax just to operate and raise our prices for consumers as a result, or we lose because it becomes much more expensive to convert users from free to premium,\" Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s chief legal officer, told reporters in June after European regulators opened an antitrust investigation into Apple based on Spotify\u2019s complaint.  Even consumers have spoken up. An enormous class-action lawsuit accuses Apple of breaking antitrust laws to enforce its commission, inflating app prices for iPhone users. The Supreme Court ruled last year the lawsuit could proceed.  On Friday, Facebook chimed in, complaining that Apple is collecting 30% of sales on its new live-events service, where people can sell expert talks, fitness classes and cooking tutorials on Facebook\u2019s app. Facebook said it wanted to process the payments itself so it could pass on 100% of the sales to the small businesses selling the talks and classes, but Apple declined.  Apple argues that it has actually cut software developers a break. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, suggested to Congress last month that when the software was still sold in brick-and-mortar stores, 50% to 70% of the retail price went to middlemen.  \"In the more than a decade since the App Store debuted, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee,\" he told lawmakers. \"The App Store evolves with the times, and every change we have made has been in the direction of providing a better experience for our users and a compelling business opportunity for developers.\"  For Google, the stakes are lower. It allows people to download apps from outside its Android app store, meaning app makers like Epic have ample ways to still reach consumers using Android devices. And Google\u2019s vast online advertising business makes its app store a much smaller portion of its overall business.  Over the past year, Apple has collected $19 billion of the $63.4 billion in sales of digital goods and services on iPhone and iPad apps, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Google collected $10 billion of the $33.8 billion in similar spending on its app store, Sensor Tower said.

Amazon\u2019s Twitch gaming platform collects 50%, according to the study. By comparison, Amazon, eBay and Walmart charge 6% to 17% for sales of goods on their websites, the study said.  What the study didn\u2019t note: Apple popularized the 30% cut.  It applied that rate on any purchases of an app in 2008, and then a year later on any transactions inside of apps for digital goods and services, such as a virtual currency in a game or a subscription to music, TV or dating app. Apple does not take a cut of apps\u2019 sales of advertising or physicals goods, and thus most apps don\u2019t pay a fee.  So how did Apple arrive at 30%?  There was some precedent; Apple had been charging roughly the same commission on music sales on its iTunes software. For each 99-cent song it sold, Apple passed on 72 cents to major music labels and 62 cents to independent labels, according to The Wall Street Journal in 2007.  When Apple began setting rules for the App Store, \"30% was just kind of a no-brainer,\" said Shoemaker, who joined the company in early 2009. \"It was, \u2018Of course that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to use.\u2019 Nobody questioned it.\"  In 2008, when Apple introduced the App Store, the company\u2019s co-founder Steve Jobs told The New York Times: \"We are not trying to be business partners\" with app developers. Rather, he added, Apple wanted to \"sell more iPhones.\"  At the time, there was far less pushback from app developers, in part because the App Store was so nascent and the digital transactions were complicated without Apple\u2019s help.  With Apple, \"it was pretty much one click and that was revolutionary,\" Shoemaker said. \"So people were willing to bite that 30%. But now, those kinds of tools are a dime a dozen.\"  Indeed, many companies now protesting Apple\u2019s fee seem willing to pay something, just not 30%.  Epic made $1.8 billion on \"Fortnite\" last year, in large part by selling the digital currency that players need to buy new features inside the game. The game itself is free.  On Thursday, Epic started its confrontation with the tech giants by allowing \"Fortnite\" users to pay it directly in its iPhone and Android apps, rather than via Apple or Google\u2019s payment systems.  Epic also offered a 20% discount on all purchases that used its payment system. That meant that if Apple and Google charged a 10% commission, their price would be about the same as the one Epic was offering its customers.  Epic has also shown that running a profitable app store is possible with a lower commission. It runs its own online marketplace for other developers to distribute their games on desktop computers. In that store, it takes 12% of sales \u2014 and still makes a profit of 5% to 7%, the company said.  Yet at Apple, the discussion has long been about how to maximize profits. In 2011, Apple executives were discussing how much to charge content providers like Hulu and the NBA for new customers who signed up via Apple TV, according to internal emails provided to House lawmakers investigating Apple.  Jai Chulani, one Apple executive, said in an email to colleagues that he worried that if Apple charged 30% of the first year of a subscription \"we may be leaving money on the table.\"  Eddy Cue, one of Apple\u2019s most senior executives, responded with a better idea: \"For recurring subscriptions, we should ask for 40%.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42879492470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MR-H5V1-JCSC-J1KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Deccan Herald</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has risen steadily in the polls to become the narrow front-runner[1] for the Democratic presidential nomination, Wall Street has gotten more and more paranoid. The doom-and-gloom talk of what a Warren Administration would bring has risen to a near-hysterical crescendo. </p><p>Hedge fund titan Leon Cooperman told Politico, in his best Bronxese, '..This is the f\u2014ing American Dream she is s\u2014ing on[2].' Another billionaire, money manager and lifelong Democrat Ron Baron, told CNBC Sen. Warren's trademark wealth tax was 'pretty nuts[3].' In Democratic primaries Elizabeth Warren couldn't buy endorsements like this, but it's clear Wall Street has lost its marbles over her rise to the top of a pretty weak Democratic field. After all, when you look at how things get done in Washington, D.C., there are huge institutional barriers to a President Warren achieving her most ambitious plans.  Among the many Wall Street firms that have churned out reports on a possible Warren presidency, Barclays' Shawn Golhar concluded that her biggest plans\u2014Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, forgiving student loan debt, and a wealth tax\u2014would all need Congressional approval. Other items, which would essentially reverse President Trump's reversal of increased regulations under President Obama, could probably be done by executive order. Read: The $15 minimum wage was supposed to hurt New York City restaurants \u2014 but both revenue and employment are up[4]  Assuming Democrats retain control of the House of Representatives in the 2020 election, the biggest obstacle to an 'I've got a plan for that' presidency would be the U.S. Senate. Remember, President Obama had a filibuster-proof 60 Democratic Senate votes for some of the time he got his signature legislation\u2014the economic stimulus package, Dodd-Frank banking reform, and the Affordable Care Act\u2014through Congress. Right now Democrats and independents who caucus with them have 47 Senate seats. Republicans have to defend 23 GOP seats of the 35 being decided in next year's election, but as Barclays and other pundits have noted, the vast majority is in deep-red states. The Cook Political Report rates only Arizona, Colorado, and Maine as true toss-up GOP-held seats[5]. But Doug Jones, the Democratic Senator from Alabama, is in a toss-up race, too, and if he loses, Democrats will need to win four seats just to get a 50-50 Senate where the vice president has the tie-breaking vote. In that case, unless Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agrees to end the filibuster\u2014a big, big 'if'\u2014Democrats would be reduced to using 'reconciliation,' a limited, highly technical procedure generally restricted to budgets and taxes. They could probably use reconciliation to repeal the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the super-rich or even to impose a wealth tax or extend some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, Barclays concludes. But Warren's 'big ideas,' like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and forgiving student loans, would be a bridge way, way too far.  The presidential pen, however, carries a lot of weight. In general, through administrative actions and executive orders, President Obama tightened regulation of energy companies, financial institutions and for-profit colleges, while President Trump removed those Obama-era regulations. A President Warren would probably go even beyond Obama, cracking down hard on banks, oil companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and Big Tech. Her Justice Department would be extremely active in antitrust litigation, perhaps moving to break up Facebook FB, 1.03%[6], Amazon AMZN, 0.83%[7], or Google's parent company Alphabet GOOG, 1.08%[8] GOOGL, 1.07%[9], or even, Barclays speculates, undoing previous tech mergers.  Read: All that a 'President Warren' could change just by executive order[10]  I think she would surprise a lot of people and continue some of the protectionist trade policies the Trump administration has instituted, especially toward China. However, a President Warren would put more of a pro-labor spin on any trade deals she negotiates.  Problem is, how many of her executive orders would withstand judicial scrutiny? She would face not only a likely 5-4 conservative Supreme Court but also a federal bench President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have stuffed full of 157 new conservative judges, more than any recent president at this point[11]. Many of President Warren's executive orders would face lengthy court challenges or judicial overrule, and a narrowly divided Senate would be hard pressed to engage in court packing, which almost undid even FDR at the height of his powers. That's why I think Wall Street is panicking prematurely and any sell-off prompted by a Warren nomination or even election may turn out to be the greatest buying opportunity for stocks in a decade. (It might also coincide with a new recession, but that's the subject of another column.) A President Warren might find her biggest obstacle isn't former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), or even President Trump, but the ghost of James Madison, whose Constitutional mechanisms have undone many an ambitious scheme for big change in the past and will surely do so in the future no matter who is president. Now read: If the Democrats keep saying crazy things about the economy, Trump will win again[12]  Howard R. Gold is a MarketWatch columnist. Follow him on Twitter @howardrgold[13].

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has risen steadily in the polls to become the narrow front-runner[1] for the Democratic presidential nomination, Wall Street has gotten more and more paranoid. The doom-and-gloom talk of what a Warren Administration would bring has risen to a near-hysterical crescendo. </p><p>Hedge fund titan Leon Cooperman told Politico, in his best Bronxese, '..This is the f\u2014ing American Dream she is s\u2014ing on[2].' Another billionaire, money manager and lifelong Democrat Ron Baron, told CNBC Sen. Warren's trademark wealth tax was 'pretty nuts[3].' In Democratic primaries Elizabeth Warren couldn't buy endorsements like this, but it's clear Wall Street has lost its marbles over her rise to the top of a pretty weak Democratic field. After all, when you look at how things get done in Washington, D.C., there are huge institutional barriers to a President Warren achieving her most ambitious plans.  Among the many Wall Street firms that have churned out reports on a possible Warren presidency, Barclays' Shawn Golhar concluded that her biggest plans\u2014Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, forgiving student loan debt, and a wealth tax\u2014would all need Congressional approval. Other items, which would essentially reverse President Trump's reversal of increased regulations under President Obama, could probably be done by executive order. Read: The $15 minimum wage was supposed to hurt New York City restaurants \u2014 but both revenue and employment are up[4]  Assuming Democrats retain control of the House of Representatives in the 2020 election, the biggest obstacle to an 'I've got a plan for that' presidency would be the U.S. Senate. Remember, President Obama had a filibuster-proof 60 Democratic Senate votes for some of the time he got his signature legislation\u2014the economic stimulus package, Dodd-Frank banking reform, and the Affordable Care Act\u2014through Congress. Right now Democrats and independents who caucus with them have 47 Senate seats. Republicans have to defend 23 GOP seats of the 35 being decided in next year's election, but as Barclays and other pundits have noted, the vast majority is in deep-red states. The Cook Political Report rates only Arizona, Colorado, and Maine as true toss-up GOP-held seats[5]. But Doug Jones, the Democratic Senator from Alabama, is in a toss-up race, too, and if he loses, Democrats will need to win four seats just to get a 50-50 Senate where the vice president has the tie-breaking vote. In that case, unless Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agrees to end the filibuster\u2014a big, big 'if'\u2014Democrats would be reduced to using 'reconciliation,' a limited, highly technical procedure generally restricted to budgets and taxes. They could probably use reconciliation to repeal the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the super-rich or even to impose a wealth tax or extend some of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, Barclays concludes. But Warren's 'big ideas,' like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and forgiving student loans, would be a bridge way, way too far.  The presidential pen, however, carries a lot of weight. In general, through administrative actions and executive orders, President Obama tightened regulation of energy companies, financial institutions and for-profit colleges, while President Trump removed those Obama-era regulations. A President Warren would probably go even beyond Obama, cracking down hard on banks, oil companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and Big Tech. Her Justice Department would be extremely active in antitrust litigation, perhaps moving to break up Facebook FB, 1.03%[6], Amazon AMZN, 0.83%[7], or Google's parent company Alphabet GOOG, 1.08%[8] GOOGL, 1.07%[9], or even, Barclays speculates, undoing previous tech mergers.  Read: All that a 'President Warren' could change just by executive order[10]  I think she would surprise a lot of people and continue some of the protectionist trade policies the Trump administration has instituted, especially toward China. However, a President Warren would put more of a pro-labor spin on any trade deals she negotiates.  Problem is, how many of her executive orders would withstand judicial scrutiny? She would face not only a likely 5-4 conservative Supreme Court but also a federal bench President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have stuffed full of 157 new conservative judges, more than any recent president at this point[11]. Many of President Warren's executive orders would face lengthy court challenges or judicial overrule, and a narrowly divided Senate would be hard pressed to engage in court packing, which almost undid even FDR at the height of his powers. That's why I think Wall Street is panicking prematurely and any sell-off prompted by a Warren nomination or even election may turn out to be the greatest buying opportunity for stocks in a decade. (It might also coincide with a new recession, but that's the subject of another column.) A President Warren might find her biggest obstacle isn't former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), or even President Trump, but the ghost of James Madison, whose Constitutional mechanisms have undone many an ambitious scheme for big change in the past and will surely do so in the future no matter who is president. Now read: If the Democrats keep saying crazy things about the economy, Trump will win again[12]  Howard R. Gold is a MarketWatch columnist. Follow him on Twitter @howardrgold[13].

In an interview with Business Insider, Schultz said that his candidacy could help fix a \"corrupt\" two-party political system. Schultz expressed admiration of former Vice President Joe Biden, but said it is too early to say whether Biden's potential candidacy would impact his own decision to run for president. He criticized the \"vilification\" of business success[4], but said his own extreme wealth would not hurt his chances should he decide to run for president. Schultz said he opposed Sen. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren's plan[5] to break up big tech companies, as well as efforts to lower the age requirement to run for president so that someone such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez[6] could run. Read on for the full interview. Howard Schultz revolutionized how America thinks about coffee as the longtime CEO of Starbucks. Now, he's convinced he can do the same for politics. In January, Schultz announced he was \"seriously considering\" running for president as a centrist independent. In the weeks since, he has faced backlash for what many believe to be an unachievable plan, which some experts say could help reelect President Donald Trump[7]. However, Schultz says he is convinced that his presidential run could help fix America. \"I'm as concerned with the current left-leaning tilt of the Democratic party towards socialism and the leading Democratic nominees at this point ... as I am about re-electing Donald Trump,\" Schultz told Business Insider in an interview last week. \"Both these solutions, in my view, would be a terrible choice for the American people in 2020.\" Schultz sat down with Business Insider to discuss his motivations, thoughts on certain policies, and beliefs about corporate responsibility in an interview in Denver, Colorado, last week. Here is how the former Starbucks CEO is thinking about politics two months after announcing his potential presidential aspirations. The following interview was edited for length and clarity. Kate Taylor: You have conducted many job interviews, hiring people at Starbucks. What was your favorite job interview questions to ask people to see if they'd be a good fit for the company? Howard Schultz: I often ask people what book they are reading. Taylor: So, what book are you reading? Schultz: I just finished Doris Kearns Goodwin's book on leadership, [\"Leadership: In Turbulent Times\"[8]], in which she kind of analyzed the leadership of four presidents. It was a very timely book, very revealing. I had the good fortune last month of having her interview me on my book tour. And I had such a crush on her. I couldn't believe I was actually sitting on stage with her, and she had a great line when she started interviewing me. She said, \"You know you're one of the first people I've interviewed who are alive.\" Because she's a historian and anyway that's how we started. She's an American treasure, and I just finished that book. Taylor: As you've been through the last couple months traveling the country, what factors are feeding into, at this point, if you decide to run for president or not run for president? Schultz: Well, seven weeks ago I said I am seriously considering running for president as a centrist independent outside of the two-party system. The two-party system is broken in many ways, and it's corrupt, and it's clearly not serving in the interest of the American people. And so what I've decided to do is very thoughtfully travel the country, and even before the book tour started I've been doing that, and trying to do everything I possibly can to understand the issues, the challenges, the aspiration that the American people have that are different than what I might normally see in my hometown of Seattle, Washington. What I've learned is a few things. One, that every single day there are ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things in their local community, in their local town, and they're living their life because they're not concerned about politics, they're concerned about their family and their children. But at the same time I've also noticed there's a cloud hanging over the country and a cloud hanging over the American people, and it's a sadness. And the sadness is a lack of trust and faith in what I would characterize as the promise of the presidency, and certainly, a lack of trust in our leaders. I think lack of trust in the truthfulness of the president, lack of trust and confidence in the extreme ideology of both parties, and the constant episodic issues everyday of fighting and not solving the problems. When you talk to and sit down in small groups, either around a kitchen table or a library, people talk to you about what they are really concerned about, and it's the everyday life. That has in many ways provided me with much more insight, and I also say much more empathy, compassion to understand that what we're lacking right now is a lack of civility, a lack of truth, a lack of grace, and all of that, for me, speaks to leadership. I spent the last 40 years of my life building a global enterprise that has done things, not because they were smarter or better, but we've done things through the lens of humanity. Comprehensive health insurance 20 years before the Affordable Care Act, ownership for every employee, free college tuition \u2014 at the same time that Starbucks stock goes up 25,000% since we went public in June of 1992. I have a track record of demonstrating that you can do these things in a way that is performance-based through the lens of humanity and in may ways, I think that is applicable to what is necessary now. We have a $22 trillion debt, we're spending $500 billion of interest expense. That's a lack of leadership. That's reckless abandonment, abdication of the responsibility that members of Congress have to the American people, and why that's immoral in my view is because that debt is going to be on the backs of my children and grandchildren and the children and grandchildren of people I've met. The immigration issue, to me, should easily be solved, but what I've come to believe is that Republicans and Democrats on both sides don't want to really solve the problem. They'd rather have this as a political issue, not allowing either side to win, to claim victory than provide the American people with a common-sense solution that 80% of the American people want. So when 80% of the American people want a common-sense solution on a number of things, and common sense on immigration, common sense on gun legislation. And, the question I'm asking is what kind of country are we living in, in which the elected officials are not only abdicating their responsibilities but ignoring the will of the people? That is why I'm seriously considering running for president as an independent. But, mostly it is my love of the country. I'm living proof, like many Americans, that my station in life growing up in the projects did not define where I will end up. And the odds of me getting from there to here are virtually impossible, but it only can happen in America. And I want to see that preserved, enhanced, and that is what I'm considering trying to do.Schultz, Biden, and Bernie Taylor: Have there been any changes as more potential Democratic nominees have emerged? Is there any Democratic nominee or potential nominee that you think could address these issues? Schultz: I'm as concerned with the current left-leaning tilt of the Democratic party towards socialism and the leading Democratic nominees at this point given the fact that we're 18 months away, I'm equally concerned about that as I am about reelecting Donald Trump. Both these solutions, in my view, would be a terrible choice for the American people in 2020. So, regardless of who runs at this point, that is not what I'm looking at. I'm looking at the American people and asking myself: \"How can I serve them?\" And it's not about who's running on the Democratic side at this stage. Taylor: So if someone who was more moderate \u2014 such as Joe Biden, for example \u2014 is the Democratic nominee, that wouldn't make a difference, as opposed to Bernie Sanders being the nominee? Schultz: First, we're 18 months away. I think it's instructive that Mayor Bloomberg did not run as a moderate Democrat, could not find a path. Whether Vice President Biden runs or not, it would be interesting to see whether he can find a path. But, it's too early for me to answer that question. What I want to try and do is make my case to the American people. The crowds that I'm talking to are getting larger. I can sense that ... what I'm saying is resonating because they are longing for truth. They're longing for leadership they can believe in, and there is a widespread recognition that the system is not working, and that both parties are involved in revenge politics everyday. Taylor: Are there any potential candidates that you do admire, or traits that you admire? Schultz: Oh, I admire Vice President Biden. I know him, I've traveled with him. How could I not admire him? He served the country for 40-plus years, he's a great man. And let me say this, which I think is very important. I was very critical of the Green New Deal for a whole host of reasons, but that's not to say I'm critical of the people. So I want to make this very important point, and that is that these are well-intentioned people who I believe, believe what they're trying to do. I just don't agree with their policies and positions. So I have my own view of how to solve some of these problems. And, what I don't like is the insincerity of suggesting things that are either unconstitutional, that the country can't possibly pay for, and most importantly won't work. I want to say this very clearly, and that is in the last few months, there's a been a level of vilification of business, business success, and specifically capitalism. I have been a capitalist my whole life, but I demonstrated that you can be a performance-driven business through the lens of humanity. And I think business and business leaders have a moral obligation to do more in the future, but our democracy and our free enterprise system is based on capitalism, and if you look at the history of the world, in the United States our economic engine and capitalism has done more to create economic opportunity, lift people out of poverty, create more jobs, innovation, solved significant problems, and create so much opportunity. So let's be careful with where we're headed, and that's why I'm equally concerned about both a socialist democratic president as well as reelecting Donald Trump.The billionaire problem Taylor: When 15 families can have $600 billion in wealth[9], as the average person is struggling in this country - how do you want to solve that issue? Schultz: I think there is a level of morality that we must address, and I think this goes back to my own upbringing. I still have the scars, the vulnerability, the shame, the insecurity of growing up in a family where my parents couldn't afford the $96-a-month rent for the apartment in the projects. That just never left me \u2014 like all of us, my childhood experiences have defined me. The level of inequality and the fact that this president is using the stock market as a proxy to the economy when over 40% of American families are $400 away from crisis. The next president of the United States must do a number of things to significantly address with urgency the level of inequality. Now, the government itself is not going to be able to solve those problems, not when we're sitting with $22 trillion of debt. ... The president of the United States gave a 21% tax rate to corporations and did not address comprehensive tax reform and infrastructure development, all of which would be of aid to and help American families who are not part of the corporation that are not benefiting from the 21% tax rate. This is what is wrong, and so if I run for president and am fortunate to win, what I can promise you is I will address the issues of inequality in many ways, because I have great empathy and compassion, because I was one of those people once in my life. And, I'm in a unique position of having lived on both ends of the spectrum. In terms of your specific question, I do believe that business has an obligation to do more for their employees and the communities they serve. I think the wealthy should be paying more in taxes. I think the corporate tax rate should not be at 21% \u2014 it should be higher, with an incentive built in to do more for your people. So I think there are ways to address this problem that could significantly narrow the gap, but what are we really talking about? We're talking about leadership. We're talking about compassion. We're talking about truthfulness, and when this president stands up, when he talks to the American people how great the economy is, it may be great for a select group of people, but the vast majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Taylor: Do you think being someone who came from the projects but is, at this point, very wealthy, has been helpful for you in your campaign, or has that been hurtful for you in your campaign? Schultz: I don't think it's been hurtful. I think people know my story, and I think when people look at the track record of Starbucks and they see, \"Wow this is a company that's had 25,000% increase in stock price but, most importantly, has created a fragile balance between profit and responsibility and shared success.\" So I've learned two things in business that I think are applicable to whether or not I run for president. And, that is not every business decision is an economical one, sometimes you have to invest in the future of your people because it's the right things to do for the business, and the second thing is Starbucks' success is threaded directly to the fact that success is better when it's shared. We have linked shareholder value with value for our people, and so the promise to the country and the American dream can't be for a select group of people. We have to open up the aperture so air can go in. We have to restore the promise. The other thing I want to say is that the character and the tonality of America is specifically linked to the character, morality, the decency, the dignity, and the grace of the Oval Office. Not only here at home, but also abroad. What I want to do if I run for president and am fortunate enough to be elected is I will restore honor and dignity back to that Oval Office.Diversity in the White House Taylor: Something else you have said if you run for president, you've promised to have more women in your cabinet than any other president. Do you have a quota for that? Do you have a percentage? How do you achieve that? Schultz: If you look at my history, the Starbucks board of directors that I put together is 40% women. And very, very diverse \u2014 over 40% of Starbucks and our company is diverse and women. The commitment I've made is that the cabinet will be the most diverse cabinet in the history of the country and have more women on the cabinet than any other cabinet in American history. Note, that is just a commitment I'm making, and it's not because it's a political slogan, it's because it's the right thing to do. And the American people should look at government with great pride, and it should be a reflection of the American people. And that's what I would do. Taylor: Could you commit to having a female vice president? Schultz: At this point, I would say that I haven't decided to run for president yet, and when I make that decision in late spring, early summer, I'll answer that question with great specificity. But, I am encouraged by the amount of women that are running for president on the Democratic side. I think it is a great example to every young girl and every woman in America about the power of women and what this means in terms of the respect that we must have for women in high office. I did a town hall yesterday with a group of entrepreneurs, and someone said, \"How many women are there at Starbucks who've left and are CEOs?\" And we started listing them, and I'm so proud of the fact that we nurtured and helped create women who are running public companies today, who were leaders at Starbucks. And so I take great pride in that. Gender pay and parental leave at Starbucks and gender pay \u2014 these are things that I think are so vitally important of the demonstration of a level of understanding, the sensitivity that business needs to transform. That we have a moral obligation to do the things necessary, that demonstrates a level of respect for the people who are doing the work and that respect, I think is not only in the sector of business and commerce, but also government. Taylor: Elizabeth Warren has proposed that large tech companies such as Amazon should be broken up. What are your thoughts on that policy? Schultz: I certainly have heard that proposal. Let me take a step back from the question and explain to you what I think has happened. These tech companies certainly have become very large and very powerful, I get that. The issue and the question is regulation versus oversight. Because these companies have developed with great speed a level of technology, that technology has outpaced the government's ability to create legislation and oversight. Specifically on the issue of privacy. So the government has a responsibility to have domain experts to understand what oversight is necessary, but the problem started with the fact that these companies outpace the government's ability to understand what oversight is necessary. So, I do not agree with Elizabeth Warren. What I do agree with is the government needs to create oversight, not regulation, oversight to provide the American people with safety and security, specifically on the issue of privacy. Taylor: With the age restriction on running for president, do you think it's fair that someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cannot run for president because she's too young? Schultz: I would just yield to the Constitution that I think has served the American people well for a number of years. I don't think it's about one person, I think it's about what the Constitution has provided the American people. But, obviously the experience, life experience, professional experience that anyone needs to run for office and hold the highest office of the land, the most powerful person in the world ... We need the right person to be the next president of the United States, to navigate through a series of issues, serve the American people well, restore our standing in the world, and elevate the issues that we have discussed, specifically the level of inequality. And I think most of all, restore trust and confidence in the promise of the country in leadership, in institutions, and in our government. Once again, I think we're talking about leadership, servant leadership. The next president of the United States needs to serve the American people, every single person.NOW WATCH: What makes macadamia nuts the most expensive nuts in the world, at $25 per pound[10]See Also: Unpaid taxes, abruptly closed locations, and employee rebellions: Inside the 6-year downfall of Michael Avenatti's coffee chain[11]'Are you going to change the name?': Chopt is no longer chopping its salads by default, and people are furious[12]JCPenney is closing 27 stores \u2014 see if your local store is on the list[13] SEE ALSO:Howard Schultz won't commit to a female vice presidential running mate.

You got it wrong. I got it wrong. Lori (ph) on the floor over here got it wrong. Howard Ward got it right. He's at Gabelli Funds and he said, \"Courage, be in the market.\" We get an update from Mr. Ward. Are you still in the market?</p><p>HOWARD WARD, CIO OF GROWTH EQUITIES, GABELLI FUNDS: Got to be, Tom. Got to be in this market, stock markets in a confirmed up trend, the economic fundamentals are quite good.</p><p>We've had a little bit of a backup in yields that's poof the market yesterday but that too shall pass. And there's no recession on -- there's a recession on the horizon, Tom, but it's too far away to see right now.</p><p>KEENE: The marginal change agent for big multinationals there are the lofty valuation is the fear of being taken out. We see that with Unilever, Kraft went after them in London. They're trying to go to Rotterdam or whatever they're trying to do. The fact is with the multiples that you and I think are unseemly, private big money wants those big companies, don't they?</p><p>WARD: Function of interest rates, Tom, and the lack of growth. And so companies --</p><p>KEENE: You're buying growth.</p><p>WARD: You're buying growth and your financing is still very cheap. This 3 percent rates for treasuries are still extremely low as a benchmark rate and so financing is available and why not? I mean, this is what companies have to do. Unilever consumer staples up. The world has almost no real growth in it and so you've got to go out and acquire.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: All right, Howard, what does that mean for -- I don't know what the story of Unilab -- Unilever really is or the repercussions. Is it, you know, shareholders saying, \"Well, we don't understand the rules in the Netherlands.\" Is it that, you know, what exactly is it about? Is it -- how humiliating is it for the chief executive, but even the prime minister of the Netherlands that was trying to do a better deal for dividend holders really to keep Unilever there?</p><p>WARD: Well, that's the whole drama that I'm not well versed in. But here's the basic point that I want to make regarding Unilever and the entire consumer staples area of the market. You're looking at companies that have top line growth of 2 percent to 3 percent, essentially. That's nominal. That's not even real.</p><p>And so these companies are trying to restructure, acquire, divest, do whatever they have to do in order to make their top and bottom lines grow and get a little bit of multiple on that, generate cash flow, buyback stock, raise dividends, reward shareholders. It's a slog. It's a grind for these companies. They have been underperforming the stock market now all year and I suspect that's going to continue for some time.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But how would you get also -- I mean, is the valuation wrong? I know it's been a slog, but if you look at, you know, the valuation of a big tech company and Unilever that makes most of the toothpastes of, you know, what we wash with around the world --</p><p>WARD: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: -- does this valuation make sense?</p><p>WARD: Well, I would argue that a lot of the tech companies are more attractively valued than the toothpaste companies. Again, it gets back to the real growth prospects currently and prospectively where it's really hard to grow your share in a slow growth world, in a world where labor --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- the population growth in Western Europe and Japan is shrinking.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: The labor force in China is shrinking. U.S. is not doing that well either on that front.</p><p>KEENE: Let's draw the pros (ph) used on a terminal. Bring the terminal up. A little hard to read on television, even harder read on radio, but we're going to do it.</p><p>Here's Unilever's growth rate. OK, negative 1 percent. Revenue growth rate, negative 1 percent, positive 2 percent, negative 5 percent. The view out, negative 5, maybe they flat line 18 months from now. That is totally unacceptable --</p><p>WARD: Correct.</p><p>KEENE: -- under any circumstances so a CEO has to do. What will American multinationals do given this trigonous of revenue?</p><p>WARD: Well, it's all very similar and they're all scrambling trying to find the next great thing, whether it's some sort of non-soda drink that --</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: -- less sugar in it that can make you workout longer.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: Or whether it's a new version of coffee, so.</p><p>KEENE: I want to tees forward, Howard, to Apple. We're going to do Apple computer with Howard Ward. Bring up the screen again to -- (INAUDIBLE) we're working to Jason. Jason is going sad Friday. This is way too much camerawork.</p><p>Here we are, Apple up 14 percent revenue growth, maybe out a year up 16 percent revenue growth. And then these three gets conservative, terrible 6 percent revenue growth. What are differences there to Apple? We'll talk about this versus the stodgy consumer companies here in a moment, back to economics as we can.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds on failure of Apple. Bring up the chart here. It's a terrible chart. It's a chart of failure and it all comes down and I think of your wonderful colleague, Haverty, Lawrence Haverty.</p><p>We're all going to die. We're all going to die. We're all going to die. And once we go up again, here's the new toy. And lo and behold, Howard, once again, we've got, you know, the iPhone XS, I guess it's going to be a success. We got to get use to this, right? The iPhone is a failure, right?</p><p>WARD: Tom, it's the most spectacular consumer product ever. There's never been a money maker like it.</p><p>KEENE: Can you buy the persistency of cash flow?</p><p>WARD: Until proven otherwise, yes. I mean, Tom, not only is the company surprising with rolling out even bigger screens and whatnot, but nobody expected the ASPs on the phones to be rising at this point --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- in the company's life cycle. They are suppose to -- they were supposed to be declining years ago and they're continuing to go up and they're continuing to sell out of the most expensive phones.</p><p>And this, Tom, is -- this is not the latest iteration of the Apple watch, this is the Gen 3, not the Gen 4. But my fancy Swiss mechanical watch is sitting on my bureau --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- and this is my baby now.</p><p>KEENE: Again, the Apple watch chart, Howard, show pulling up for radio. I want to talk about the people that aren't Howard Ward. And Michael Purves had a fabulous article over at Weeden about the pressure in October, in November, I'm behind by X number of basis point. I've got to catch up to the benchmark, which means you must buy Apple to readjust 119. Is that going to happen? Are people little going to be forced to buy Apple?</p><p>WARD: Yes, some people will be forced to buy Apple. They will feel the pressure to buy Apple and buy some -- buying some of the other big things, stocks as well. These have been the big money makers in the stock market. There is no sense at this point that that's going to end anytime soon.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. It shows me a contender. Howard, you're absolutely right when it comes to wearables, Apple watch remains the best- selling. I think they shoot some 4.7 million. But is there going to be something coming from China that will actually hurt Apple sales? Will they be able to get market share?</p><p>WARD: Well, China is, you know, because of the current trade negotiations that are taking place to China, on a short-term basis, that's a little bit of an uncertain situation. So let me talk about the trade situation for a moment.</p><p>Canada and Mexico, we've got a new deal there with some minor concessions, not a big deal. China is a different animal altogether. The trade situation with China, that negotiation is going to take longer. It's more complex. It's going to be more difficult. It's going to stretch in the next year. It could take place for some time.</p><p>But let's go back to the basic principle that's driving the Trump administration's logic, which is that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China, OK. We are not the biggest -- our exports are 13 percent of GDP, that makes us one of the smallest export driven countries in the world. That's the percentage of our total economy.</p><p>All of these countries needed us more than we need them. So therefore, a trade war is likely to hurt them more than it will hurt us, although any trade war is likely to hurt everybody to some extend.</p><p>But the theory is that we can outlast China and gain concessions and China does need to change its industrial policy. It has been taking advantage of the United States. And now, of course, we have this new disclosure this week that there is some evidence that China had been implanting chips and hacking into a number of new technology companies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA: OK. So that's a Bloomberg scoop that we've been -- which I just wanted to ask you, actually. This is, you know, it was a Bloomberg Businessweek scoop, Howard.</p><p>And let me remind all of our viewers and listeners on radio on how China used the tiny chip to infiltrate about 30 U.S. companies. Does it make a difference to the supply chain of Apple, of Amazon and others? And does it mean that actually the -- if they do change the supply chain, their costs will go up?</p><p>WARD: Yes. So my guess is that there will be some changes at the margin that will take place overtime. However, the cost issue is an interesting one because the big cost advantage that manufacturers had in China five years ago is basically gone now.</p><p>Hard to believe, but wages have risen dramatically in China, cost of doing business here in the United States, including taxes, has gone down. You still have that transportation costs to bring goods over from China.</p><p>So, the United States has actually become very fertile ground for new manufacturing plants. And so there will be an adjustment even without this latest news about what China did or didn't do regarding this 30 U.S. tech company.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: The incentive for companies to build plant and equipment, the CapEx here in the United States is greater than it has been in years.</p><p>LACQUA: Howard, thank you. Howard Ward there of Gabelli Funds stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Right now, Carl Riccadonna to get us started, our Chief U.S. Economist. Carl, I want to show a chart which to me is the single most stunning social and optimistic chart on the Bloomberg.</p><p>This is claims -- weekly claims as compared to the employed of America back 62 years -- excuse me, 52 years. And it's stunning to me, Carl, how here it was a beautiful, wonderful market here and here and here and we have this absolute original anomaly of those no claims versus the market. It's more perfectly employed, aren't we?</p><p>CARL RICCADONNA, BLOOMBERG CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST: Well, we're close to the perfect point and one wouldn't guess that given the three handle on the unemployment rate you would think that we are potentially overheating, but dynamics have changed in the labor market and 3.8 percent, 3.9 percent unemployment doesn't mean what it used to for what pressures (ph) in the economy.</p><p>KEENE: The number one mail I get other than why did I listen to Howard Ward on Apple is the simple question, we're not fully employed. Carl Riccadonna is wrong. John Williams is wrong with Michael McKee today. We're not fully employed, that's what we hear.</p><p>RICCADONNA: We know we're fully employed when we cross through full employment because we start to get more wage pressures in the economy. And so it didn't happen at 5.5 percent. It didn't happen at 4.5 percent. It seems to be finally happening now that we're crossing below 4 percent unemployment.</p><p>So, again, we can't just look at the unemployment rate, we have to look at a broader array of labor indicators, including wage pressures and full employment to something that you can recognize in the rearview mirror. We're starting to see that now.</p><p>So, if we look at the course of wage pressures, we can say, yes, it's weak relative to past cycles. But the -- as you say, Tom, the vector is upward sloping finally in 2018 and that gives us confidence that, yes, we finally are hitting the sweet spot for the labor market.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Carl, what does that mean for the Fed?</p><p>RICCADONNA: What that means for the Fed is I think they will have more confidence that the economy is on a sturdy footing and can handle a few more rate increases. And we see that express in the treasury market earlier this week.</p><p>The manufacturing ISM came in much stronger than expected. Well, that's a good signal that growth will be solid in the second half of the year, not as solid as we saw in the second quarter, but it will be on a firm trajectory.</p><p>And so the market is starting to have fewer doubts about what the Fed is signaling and also looking for a more robust outlook over the longer run, which is why we see the long end of the curve moving higher as well. In fact, moving up more so than the short end of the curve.</p><p>LACQUA: Carl, if you look at the, you know, significant repricing in treasuries on Wednesday, what do you think the Fed would have made of that?</p><p>RICCADONNA: Well, I think they would maybe see some signs that finally, right, the Fed has been tightening, tightening, tightening, and it's not being reflected in financial conditions.</p><p>Finally this week we see that they are getting tractions, whether it's the backup in treasury yields or also the pullback in equity markets, this is the tightening of financial conditions that the Fed is trying to have come about in a very smooth and orderly fashion, not uncoincidentally the ECB reduce the pace of asset purchases this week and the Fed also opened the spigot a bit further in terms of balance sheet unwind. The fact that happened to the same week that Italian debt move and treasury move, I think is not a coincidence.</p><p>KEENE: I want to bring both of you. Howard, I'm going to go to you first. This is not firm payrolls, all sorts of moving averages of where we are just below 200,000, a huge shock. And I'm hearing Howard Ward whisper numbers that are way higher than what Carl Riccadonna's used to.</p><p>It is to make America great economy. But from where you sit looking at equities, do we sustain that economy that gives us 250,000, 300,000 or 400,000 monthly employment whisper numbers?</p><p>WARD: Well, I think we're still enjoying the surge that the economy has experienced from the tax reform, which has resulted in 20 percent gains in earnings this year and has helped the employment picture. And I think as the labor pool shrinks and as skilled labor becomes more difficult to find, which is happening, and as wage prices rise. I think wages are up --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- to eight (ph) in the last 12 months. That's going to go 2 percent, 3 percent soon, I believe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD: So we're not going to be sustaining 250, 220. I think that number is going to be more like 175 for the next 12 months, 150 --.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- 175, not 200.</p><p>KEENE: If we go back to the chart, please, you can hardly see this on the chart because I messed up the actual series. And we've got the moving averages here all clustered in here, Carl. Way back here in 2010 is a blowout number. Are we going to see a blowout number today? I'm hearing this whispered, 350, 340, 400.</p><p>RICCADONA: So that 2010 number was partly related to what all of these flips higher to conduct the 10-year senses in the U.S.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Well, a lot of people are higher for Red Sox, Yankees playoffs, right?</p><p>RICCADONA: In that period, wage pressures were extremely low. So if the economy is growing fast then, of course, with faster GDP, you get faster hiring. Howard is exactly spot on to the notion now that we're having constraints in the labor market.</p><p>So even if you're having a fast quarter in those demands for labor, you might not have those very robust payroll gains because workers simply are not available or if you have to coax them to join your firm, you have to offer higher paychecks.</p><p>WARD: Tom, you being a statistician, you know it very well. You got to smooth those numbers. One most (ph) numbers don't mean anything, you know that. And they get revised. They get revised.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA: There you go. Tom, you get extra points for that. Howard, when you look at dollar dynamics, what does dollar do from here?</p><p>WARD: Dollar continues to be in an upturn. Why? Because the U.S. is out railing the rest of the world and because we have the strong interest rate differential already and the Fed is still tightening. So I want to see how the dollar does anything by continue to trend higher over the coming months.</p><p>RICCADONNA: Francine, just to that point I would say that, you know, in addition to that, what we've seen is when central banks moved from unconventional policy easing towards tightening, they ultimately have to move more slowly than expected.</p><p>And if that is true for the ECB as well, then that means, again, whether it's interest rate differentials or just tightening of normalization of policy, the Fed is way out ahead of everyone else, not just interest rates, but also balance sheet and that argues for a stronger dollar.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD: -- if you look at the emerging market bonds.</p><p>LACQUA: Right, exactly. Does the Fed need to look at the dollar dynamics? Maybe they don't say it because any contagion from emerging markets, because a lot of the countries are, of course, dollar denominated debt rich, do they need to watch out because if the dollar gets too high, this goes against the purpose of what the Fed is trying to do?</p><p>WARD: The Fed is going to look at that. You're right, they're not going to ever admit that they care about that. But they have to understand that global growth actually slowed this year in Europe, Japan, and China. The U.S. was the only major economic region that had an acceleration in growth this year. And next year, we're going to be slowing too.</p><p>We have peak growth in the second quarter, so in a world where global growth is slowing, where there's a lot of issues about debt and dollar denominated debt in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging markets, yes, the Fed is going to look at that, they'll take it into consideration. It's not a priority for them, but they can't ignore it. They'll never admit that they care about it.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Carl and Howard, thank you. Carl Riccadonna there from Bloomberg. Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Single best chart, you do that on Bloomberg Surveillance with your guest. And Francine and I are advantage by Howard Ward of Gabelli, who seen history provides a wonderful temple to stock selection and active management.</p><p>It's a Dow, I've shown this a lot over the last several days. All of the Dow members normalize back to the beginning of a crisis, Apple, Visa, Nike, and a couple others down here and then the bundle.</p><p>Then why is everybody putting their money in the bundle, Howard? Why is everybody buying all of the Dow instead of trying to pick out these? And as you know, Howard, not pick out the group down here, including GE?</p><p>WARD: Yes. Well, I guess there is some safety in what is perceived to be less risky stocks. But perhaps certainly the stocks that have been the best performers are sometimes pricey and they'll have setbacks. But when you look at the two big winners there, Apple and Visa, those are not what anybody would characterize as that type of crazy stocks, the terrific businesses.</p><p>KEENE: Right. I have not done a survey about August and Graham done (INAUDIBLE). There's not much in price to sales, I go back to time Galvin (ph) and DLJ and Credit Suisse a million years ago. We're in a price to sales zero, aren't we?</p><p>WARD: Yes, to some extent, certainly for the most rapidly growing younger companies. But if you take Apple for an instance, let's look at Apple as an enterprise value. I headed up earlier about $975 billion. They're going to generate about $65 billion in free cash flow this year. So your multiple of free cash flow is, what, 15?</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: And the free cash flow in the last 12 months has advanced about 20 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: And, you know, even when revenues slow down in another year, they're going to be 5 plus percent. Revenue growth this year, in this big year for the S&amp;P, is 4.5 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right. What's critical year, Francine, is the free cash flow of Apple is not back to but almost back to where it was before their new dividend in cash policy. It's a remarkable growth.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. It is a remarkable. I really like your charts, Tom, today. And actually, if you do want to steal some of Tom's charts, I suggest you do right for the weekend. Just go into GTv Go. But, Howard the crucial question is like this is fine as long as there's not a downturn. It's fine as long as there's not a perfect storm actually hitting a lot of equities. Where do you see the biggest risk coming from?</p><p>WARD: Well, you know what, in terms of some of these thing (ph) types of stocks, not necessarily Apple so much, but some of the other ones, I see the risk is government regulation. I think that they're -- you know, this is something that's going on in the background, lots of talk about how to regulate some of these behemoths. And I think that poses a risk to those companies.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm going to go back to that monetary tightening. The interest rates have doubled in the last two years. The global PMI for manufacturing has declined in eight of the nine months so far this year, just over 52 right now. That's how been highly correlated to growth here and to the stock market here.</p><p>And so I would really focus on that and with the Fed between raising rates, they're going to do it again in December, it looks like. You've got quantitative tightening now at the rate of $600 billion annually while they're shrinking their balance sheet.</p><p>The lag time between raising rates and hitting the economy is 18 months to two years. A lot of tightening in the pipeline, 60 percent increase in the price of oil since June of '17, that hits with a lag of about a year so that's now starting to hit. The rise in the dollar up about 7 percent since April and trending higher, that's the headwind for growth.</p><p>So I do think that, you know, we're moving into a slower growth period. I think the Fed has the risk here of over tightening, the telegraphing in addition to the December hike, two hikes next year.</p><p>So, you know, what happen to three steps and a stumble? So far we're eight steps, eight tightening and you don't even see that when you look at the S&amp;P 500. But you do see it when you look at some of the subindices, if you look at the auto group, the homebuilding group. The interest rate sensitive groups are experiencing real pressure in the stock market and in the real economy.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. So how do you protect yourself against that, right? Do you go to yen? Is there part of your portfolio that you have to hedge?</p><p>WARD: Defensive growth companies which have led the market this year and which everyone thinks have been exhausted there in what they can do, but I disagree. But as long as the Fed is tightening, I want to stay away from the more cyclical names, the more value names. I want to stick with defensive growth. What's worked I think will continue to work, obviously not every day or week.</p><p>KEENE: Howard Ward with us, and we'll continue this conversation with Jon Ferro of Bloomberg Surveillance on the radio worldwide.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

You got it wrong.  I got it wrong.  Lori  (ph) on the floor over here got it wrong.  Howard Ward got it right.  He's  at Gabelli Funds and he said, \"Courage, be in the market.\"  We get an  update from Mr. Ward.  Are you still in the market?</p><p>HOWARD WARD, CIO OF GROWTH EQUITIES, GABELLI FUNDS:  Got to be, Tom.   Got to be in this market, stock markets in a confirmed up trend, the  economic fundamentals are quite good.</p><p>We've had a little bit of a backup in yields that's poof the market  yesterday but that too shall pass.  And there's no recession on -- there's  a recession on the horizon, Tom, but it's too far away to see right now.</p><p>KEENE:  The marginal change agent for big multinationals there are the  lofty valuation is the fear of being taken out.  We see that with Unilever,  Kraft went after them in London.  They're trying to go to Rotterdam or  whatever they're trying to do.  The fact is with the multiples that you and  I think are unseemly, private big money wants those big companies, don't  they?</p><p>WARD:  Function of interest rates, Tom, and the lack of growth.  And  so companies --</p><p>KEENE:  You're buying growth.</p><p>WARD:  You're buying growth and your financing is still very cheap.   This 3 percent rates for treasuries are still extremely low as a benchmark  rate and so financing is available and why not?  I mean, this is what  companies have to do.  Unilever consumer staples up.  The world has almost  no real growth in it and so you've got to go out and acquire.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  All right, Howard, what does that  mean for -- I don't know what the story of Unilab -- Unilever really is or  the repercussions.  Is it, you know, shareholders saying, \"Well, we don't  understand the rules in the Netherlands.\"  Is it that, you know, what  exactly is it about?  Is it -- how humiliating is it for the chief  executive, but even the prime minister of the Netherlands that was trying  to do a better deal for dividend holders really to keep Unilever there?</p><p>WARD:  Well, that's the whole drama that I'm not well versed in.  But  here's the basic point that I want to make regarding Unilever and the  entire consumer staples area of the market.  You're looking at companies  that have top line growth of 2 percent to 3 percent, essentially.  That's  nominal.  That's not even real.</p><p>And so these companies are trying to restructure, acquire, divest, do  whatever they have to do in order to make their top and bottom lines grow  and get a little bit of multiple on that, generate cash flow, buyback  stock, raise dividends, reward shareholders.  It's a slog.  It's a grind  for these companies.  They have been underperforming the stock market now  all year and I suspect that's going to continue for some time.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  But how would you get also -- I mean, is the  valuation wrong?  I know it's been a slog, but if you look at, you know,  the valuation of a big tech company and Unilever that makes most of the  toothpastes of, you know, what we wash with around the world --</p><p>WARD:  Yes.</p><p>LACQUA:  -- does this valuation make sense?</p><p>WARD:  Well, I would argue that a lot of the tech companies are more  attractively valued than the toothpaste companies.  Again, it gets back to  the real growth prospects currently and prospectively where it's really  hard to grow your share in a slow growth world, in a world where labor --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- the population growth in Western Europe and Japan is  shrinking.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  The labor force in China is shrinking.  U.S. is not doing that  well either on that front.</p><p>KEENE:  Let's draw the pros (ph) used on a terminal.  Bring the  terminal up.  A little hard to read on television, even harder read on  radio, but we're going to do it.</p><p>Here's Unilever's growth rate.  OK, negative 1 percent.  Revenue  growth rate, negative 1 percent, positive 2 percent, negative 5 percent.   The view out, negative 5, maybe they flat line 18 months from now.  That is  totally unacceptable --</p><p>WARD:  Correct.</p><p>KEENE:  -- under any circumstances so a CEO has to do.  What will  American multinationals do given this trigonous of revenue?</p><p>WARD:  Well, it's all very similar and they're all scrambling trying  to find the next great thing, whether it's some sort of non-soda drink that  --</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  -- less sugar in it that can make you workout longer.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  Or whether it's a new version of coffee, so.</p><p>KEENE:  I want to tees forward, Howard, to Apple.  We're going to do  Apple computer with Howard Ward.  Bring up the screen again to --  (INAUDIBLE) we're working to Jason.  Jason is going sad Friday.  This is  way too much camerawork.</p><p>Here we are, Apple up 14 percent revenue growth, maybe out a year up  16 percent revenue growth.  And then these three gets conservative,  terrible 6 percent revenue growth.  What are differences there to Apple?   We'll talk about this versus the stodgy consumer companies here in a  moment, back to economics as we can.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds on failure of Apple.  Bring up  the chart here.  It's a terrible chart.  It's a chart of failure and it all  comes down and I think of your wonderful colleague, Haverty, Lawrence  Haverty.</p><p>We're all going to die.  We're all going to die.  We're all going to  die.  And once we go up again, here's the new toy.  And lo and behold,  Howard, once again, we've got, you know, the iPhone XS, I guess it's going  to be a success.  We got to get use to this, right?  The iPhone is a  failure, right?</p><p>WARD:  Tom, it's the most spectacular consumer product ever.  There's  never been a money maker like it.</p><p>KEENE:  Can you buy the persistency of cash flow?</p><p>WARD:  Until proven otherwise, yes.  I mean, Tom, not only is the  company surprising with rolling out even bigger screens and whatnot, but  nobody expected the ASPs on the phones to be rising at this point --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- in the company's life cycle.  They are suppose to -- they  were supposed to be declining years ago and they're continuing to go up and  they're continuing to sell out of the most expensive phones.</p><p>And this, Tom, is -- this is not the latest iteration of the Apple  watch, this is the Gen 3, not the Gen 4.  But my fancy Swiss mechanical  watch is sitting on my bureau --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- and this is my baby now.</p><p>KEENE:  Again, the Apple watch chart, Howard, show pulling up for  radio.  I want to talk about the people that aren't Howard Ward.  And  Michael Purves had a fabulous article over at Weeden about the pressure in  October, in November, I'm behind by X number of basis point.  I've got to  catch up to the benchmark, which means you must buy Apple to readjust 119.   Is that going to happen?  Are people little going to be forced to buy  Apple?</p><p>WARD:  Yes, some people will be forced to buy Apple.  They will feel  the pressure to buy Apple and buy some -- buying some of the other big  things, stocks as well.  These have been the big money makers in the stock  market.  There is no sense at this point that that's going to end anytime  soon.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.  It shows me a contender.  Howard, you're  absolutely right when it comes to wearables, Apple watch remains the best- selling.  I think they shoot some 4.7 million.  But is there going to be  something coming from China that will actually hurt Apple sales?  Will they  be able to get market share?</p><p>WARD:  Well, China is, you know, because of the current trade  negotiations that are taking place to China, on a short-term basis, that's  a little bit of an uncertain situation.  So let me talk about the trade  situation for a moment.</p><p>Canada and Mexico, we've got a new deal there with some minor  concessions, not a big deal.  China is a different animal altogether.  The  trade situation with China, that negotiation is going to take longer.  It's  more complex.  It's going to be more difficult.  It's going to stretch in  the next year.  It could take place for some time.</p><p>But let's go back to the basic principle that's driving the Trump  administration's logic, which is that China needs the United States more  than the United States needs China, OK.  We are not the biggest -- our  exports are 13 percent of GDP, that makes us one of the smallest export  driven countries in the world.  That's the percentage of our total economy.</p><p>All of these countries needed us more than we need them.  So  therefore, a trade war is likely to hurt them more than it will hurt us,  although any trade war is likely to hurt everybody to some extend.</p><p>But the theory is that we can outlast China and gain concessions and  China does need to change its industrial policy.  It has been taking  advantage of the United States.  And now, of course, we have this new  disclosure this week that there is some evidence that China had been  implanting chips and hacking into a number of new technology companies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  So that's a Bloomberg scoop that we've been -- which I  just wanted to ask you, actually.  This is, you know, it was a Bloomberg  Businessweek scoop, Howard.</p><p>And let me remind all of our viewers and listeners on radio on how  China used the tiny chip to infiltrate about 30 U.S. companies.  Does it  make a difference to the supply chain of Apple, of Amazon and others?  And  does it mean that actually the -- if they do change the supply chain, their  costs will go up?</p><p>WARD:  Yes.  So my guess is that there will be some changes at the  margin that will take place overtime.  However, the cost issue is an  interesting one because the big cost advantage that manufacturers had in  China five years ago is basically gone now.</p><p>Hard to believe, but wages have risen dramatically in China, cost of  doing business here in the United States, including taxes, has gone down.   You still have that transportation costs to bring goods over from China.</p><p>So, the United States has actually become very fertile ground for new  manufacturing plants.  And so there will be an adjustment even without this  latest news about what China did or didn't do regarding this 30 U.S. tech  company.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  The incentive for companies to build plant and equipment, the  CapEx here in the United States is greater than it has been in years.</p><p>LACQUA:  Howard, thank you.  Howard Ward there of Gabelli Funds stays  with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Right now, Carl Riccadonna to get us started, our Chief U.S.  Economist.  Carl, I want to show a chart which to me is the single most  stunning social and optimistic chart on the Bloomberg.</p><p>This is claims -- weekly claims as compared to the employed of America  back 62 years -- excuse me, 52 years.  And it's stunning to me, Carl, how  here it was a beautiful, wonderful market here and here and here and we  have this absolute original anomaly of those no claims versus the market.   It's more perfectly employed, aren't we?</p><p>CARL RICCADONNA, BLOOMBERG CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST:  Well, we're close to  the perfect point and one wouldn't guess that given the three handle on the  unemployment rate you would think that we are potentially overheating, but  dynamics have changed in the labor market and 3.8 percent, 3.9 percent  unemployment doesn't mean what it used to for what pressures (ph) in the  economy.</p><p>KEENE:  The number one mail I get other than why did I listen to  Howard Ward on Apple is the simple question, we're not fully employed.   Carl Riccadonna is wrong.  John Williams is wrong with Michael McKee today.   We're not fully employed, that's what we hear.</p><p>RICCADONNA:  We know we're fully employed when we cross through full  employment because we start to get more wage pressures in the economy.  And  so it didn't happen at 5.5 percent.  It didn't happen at 4.5 percent.  It  seems to be finally happening now that we're crossing below 4 percent  unemployment.</p><p>So, again, we can't just look at the unemployment rate, we have to  look at a broader array of labor indicators, including wage pressures and  full employment to something that you can recognize in the rearview mirror.   We're starting to see that now.</p><p>So, if we look at the course of wage pressures, we can say, yes, it's  weak relative to past cycles.  But the -- as you say, Tom, the vector is  upward sloping finally in 2018 and that gives us confidence that, yes, we  finally are hitting the sweet spot for the labor market.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Carl, what does that mean for the Fed?</p><p>RICCADONNA:  What that means for the Fed is I think they will have  more confidence that the economy is on a sturdy footing and can handle a  few more rate increases.  And we see that express in the treasury market  earlier this week.</p><p>The manufacturing ISM came in much stronger than expected.  Well,  that's a good signal that growth will be solid in the second half of the  year, not as solid as we saw in the second quarter, but it will be on a  firm trajectory.</p><p>And so the market is starting to have fewer doubts about what the Fed  is signaling and also looking for a more robust outlook over the longer  run, which is why we see the long end of the curve moving higher as well.   In fact, moving up more so than the short end of the curve.</p><p>LACQUA:  Carl, if you look at the, you know, significant repricing in  treasuries on Wednesday, what do you think the Fed would have made of that?</p><p>RICCADONNA:  Well, I think they would maybe see some signs that  finally, right, the Fed has been tightening, tightening, tightening, and  it's not being reflected in financial conditions.</p><p>Finally this week we see that they are getting tractions, whether it's  the backup in treasury yields or also the pullback in equity markets, this  is the tightening of financial conditions that the Fed is trying to have  come about in a very smooth and orderly fashion, not uncoincidentally the  ECB reduce the pace of asset purchases this week and the Fed also opened  the spigot a bit further in terms of balance sheet unwind.  The fact that  happened to the same week that Italian debt move and treasury move, I think  is not a coincidence.</p><p>KEENE:  I want to bring both of you.  Howard, I'm going to go to you  first.  This is not firm payrolls, all sorts of moving averages of where we  are just below 200,000, a huge shock.  And I'm hearing Howard Ward whisper  numbers that are way higher than what Carl Riccadonna's used to.</p><p>It is to make America great economy.  But from where you sit looking  at equities, do we sustain that economy that gives us 250,000, 300,000 or  400,000 monthly employment whisper numbers?</p><p>WARD:  Well, I think we're still enjoying the surge that the economy  has experienced from the tax reform, which has resulted in 20 percent gains  in earnings this year and has helped the employment picture.  And I think  as the labor pool shrinks and as skilled labor becomes more difficult to  find, which is happening, and as wage prices rise.  I think wages are up --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- to eight (ph) in the last 12 months.  That's going to go 2  percent, 3 percent soon, I believe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD:  So we're not going to be sustaining 250, 220.  I think that  number is going to be more like 175 for the next 12 months, 150 --.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- 175, not 200.</p><p>KEENE:  If we go back to the chart, please, you can hardly see this on  the chart because I messed up the actual series.  And we've got the moving  averages here all clustered in here, Carl.  Way back here in 2010 is a  blowout number.  Are we going to see a blowout number today?  I'm hearing  this whispered, 350, 340, 400.</p><p>RICCADONA:  So that 2010 number was partly related to what all of  these flips higher to conduct the 10-year senses in the U.S.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Well, a lot of people are higher for Red Sox, Yankees  playoffs, right?</p><p>RICCADONA:  In that period, wage pressures were extremely low.  So if  the economy is growing fast then, of course, with faster GDP, you get  faster hiring.  Howard is exactly spot on to the notion now that we're  having constraints in the labor market.</p><p>So even if you're having a fast quarter in those demands for labor,  you might not have those very robust payroll gains because workers simply  are not available or if you have to coax them to join your firm, you have  to offer higher paychecks.</p><p>WARD:  Tom, you being a statistician, you know it very well.  You got  to smooth those numbers.  One most (ph) numbers don't mean anything, you  know that.  And they get revised.  They get revised.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA:  There you go.  Tom, you get extra points for that.  Howard,  when you look at dollar dynamics, what does dollar do from here?</p><p>WARD:  Dollar continues to be in an upturn.  Why?  Because the U.S. is  out railing the rest of the world and because we have the strong interest  rate differential already and the Fed is still tightening.  So I want to  see how the dollar does anything by continue to trend higher over the  coming months.</p><p>RICCADONNA:  Francine, just to that point I would say that, you know,  in addition to that, what we've seen is when central banks moved from  unconventional policy easing towards tightening, they ultimately have to  move more slowly than expected.</p><p>And if that is true for the ECB as well, then that means, again,  whether it's interest rate differentials or just tightening of  normalization of policy, the Fed is way out ahead of everyone else, not  just interest rates, but also balance sheet and that argues for a stronger  dollar.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD:  -- if you look at the emerging market bonds.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right, exactly.  Does the Fed need to look at the dollar  dynamics?  Maybe they don't say it because any contagion from emerging  markets, because a lot of the countries are, of course, dollar denominated  debt rich, do they need to watch out because if the dollar gets too high,  this goes against the purpose of what the Fed is trying to do?</p><p>WARD:  The Fed is going to look at that.  You're right, they're not  going to ever admit that they care about that.  But they have to understand  that global growth actually slowed this year in Europe, Japan, and China.   The U.S. was the only major economic region that had an acceleration in  growth this year.  And next year, we're going to be slowing too.</p><p>We have peak growth in the second quarter, so in a world where global  growth is slowing, where there's a lot of issues about debt and dollar  denominated debt in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging  markets, yes, the Fed is going to look at that, they'll take it into  consideration.  It's not a priority for them, but they can't ignore it.   They'll never admit that they care about it.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Carl and Howard, thank you.  Carl Riccadonna there  from Bloomberg.  Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Single best chart, you do that on Bloomberg Surveillance with  your guest.  And Francine and I are advantage by Howard Ward of Gabelli,  who seen history provides a wonderful temple to stock selection and active  management.</p><p>It's a Dow, I've shown this a lot over the last several days.  All of  the Dow members normalize back to the beginning of a crisis, Apple, Visa,  Nike, and a couple others down here and then the bundle.</p><p>Then why is everybody putting their money in the bundle, Howard?  Why  is everybody buying all of the Dow instead of trying to pick out these?   And as you know, Howard, not pick out the group down here, including GE?</p><p>WARD:  Yes.  Well, I guess there is some safety in what is perceived  to be less risky stocks.  But perhaps certainly the stocks that have been  the best performers are sometimes pricey and they'll have setbacks.  But  when you look at the two big winners there, Apple and Visa, those are not  what anybody would characterize as that type of crazy stocks, the terrific  businesses.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.  I have not done a survey about August and Graham done  (INAUDIBLE).  There's not much in price to sales, I go back to time Galvin  (ph) and DLJ and Credit Suisse a million years ago.  We're in a price to  sales zero, aren't we?</p><p>WARD:  Yes, to some extent, certainly for the most rapidly growing  younger companies.  But if you take Apple for an instance, let's look at  Apple as an enterprise value.  I headed up earlier about $975 billion.   They're going to generate about $65 billion in free cash flow this year.   So your multiple of free cash flow is, what, 15?</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  And the free cash flow in the last 12 months has advanced about  20 percent.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  And, you know, even when revenues slow down in another year,  they're going to be 5 plus percent.  Revenue growth this year, in this big  year for the S&amp;P, is 4.5 percent.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.  What's critical year, Francine, is the free cash flow  of Apple is not back to but almost back to where it was before their new  dividend in cash policy.  It's a remarkable growth.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes.  It is a remarkable.  I really like your charts, Tom,  today.  And actually, if you do want to steal some of Tom's charts, I  suggest you do right for the weekend.  Just go into GTv Go.  But, Howard  the crucial question is like this is fine as long as there's not a  downturn.  It's fine as long as there's not a perfect storm actually  hitting a lot of equities.  Where do you see the biggest risk coming from?</p><p>WARD:  Well, you know what, in terms of some of these thing (ph) types  of stocks, not necessarily Apple so much, but some of the other ones, I see  the risk is government regulation.  I think that they're -- you know, this  is something that's going on in the background, lots of talk about how to  regulate some of these behemoths.  And I think that poses a risk to those  companies.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm going to go back to that monetary tightening.  The  interest rates have doubled in the last two years.  The global PMI for  manufacturing has declined in eight of the nine months so far this year,  just over 52 right now.  That's how been highly correlated to growth here  and to the stock market here.</p><p>And so I would really focus on that and with the Fed between raising  rates, they're going to do it again in December, it looks like.  You've got  quantitative tightening now at the rate of $600 billion annually while  they're shrinking their balance sheet.</p><p>The lag time between raising rates and hitting the economy is 18  months to two years.  A lot of tightening in the pipeline, 60 percent  increase in the price of oil since June of '17, that hits with a lag of  about a year so that's now starting to hit.  The rise in the dollar up  about 7 percent since April and trending higher, that's the headwind for  growth.</p><p>So I do think that, you know, we're moving into a slower growth  period.  I think the Fed has the risk here of over tightening, the  telegraphing in addition to the December hike, two hikes next year.</p><p>So, you know, what happen to three steps and a stumble?  So far we're  eight steps, eight tightening and you don't even see that when you look at  the S&amp;P 500.  But you do see it when you look at some of the subindices, if  you look at the auto group, the homebuilding group.  The interest rate  sensitive groups are experiencing real pressure in the stock market and in  the real economy.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  So how do you protect yourself against that, right?   Do you go to yen?  Is there part of your portfolio that you have to hedge?</p><p>WARD:  Defensive growth companies which have led the market this year  and which everyone thinks have been exhausted there in what they can do,  but I disagree.  But as long as the Fed is tightening, I want to stay away  from the more cyclical names, the more value names.  I want to stick with  defensive growth.  What's worked I think will continue to work, obviously  not every day or week.</p><p>KEENE:  Howard Ward with us, and we'll continue this conversation with  Jon Ferro of Bloomberg Surveillance on the radio worldwide.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

You got it wrong. I got it wrong. Lori (ph) on the floor over here got it wrong. Howard Ward got it right. He's at Gabelli Funds and he said, \"Courage, be in the market.\" We get an update from Mr. Ward. Are you still in the market?</p><p>HOWARD WARD, CIO OF GROWTH EQUITIES, GABELLI FUNDS: Got to be, Tom. Got to be in this market, stock markets in a confirmed up trend, the economic fundamentals are quite good.</p><p>We've had a little bit of a backup in yields that's poof the market yesterday but that too shall pass. And there's no recession on -- there's a recession on the horizon, Tom, but it's too far away to see right now.</p><p>KEENE: The marginal change agent for big multinationals there are the lofty valuation is the fear of being taken out. We see that with Unilever, Kraft went after them in London. They're trying to go to Rotterdam or whatever they're trying to do. The fact is with the multiples that you and I think are unseemly, private big money wants those big companies, don't they?</p><p>WARD: Function of interest rates, Tom, and the lack of growth. And so companies --</p><p>KEENE: You're buying growth.</p><p>WARD: You're buying growth and your financing is still very cheap. This 3 percent rates for treasuries are still extremely low as a benchmark rate and so financing is available and why not? I mean, this is what companies have to do. Unilever consumer staples up. The world has almost no real growth in it and so you've got to go out and acquire.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: All right, Howard, what does that mean for -- I don't know what the story of Unilab -- Unilever really is or the repercussions. Is it, you know, shareholders saying, \"Well, we don't understand the rules in the Netherlands.\" Is it that, you know, what exactly is it about? Is it -- how humiliating is it for the chief executive, but even the prime minister of the Netherlands that was trying to do a better deal for dividend holders really to keep Unilever there?</p><p>WARD: Well, that's the whole drama that I'm not well versed in. But here's the basic point that I want to make regarding Unilever and the entire consumer staples area of the market. You're looking at companies that have top line growth of 2 percent to 3 percent, essentially. That's nominal. That's not even real.</p><p>And so these companies are trying to restructure, acquire, divest, do whatever they have to do in order to make their top and bottom lines grow and get a little bit of multiple on that, generate cash flow, buyback stock, raise dividends, reward shareholders. It's a slog. It's a grind for these companies. They have been underperforming the stock market now all year and I suspect that's going to continue for some time.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. But how would you get also -- I mean, is the valuation wrong? I know it's been a slog, but if you look at, you know, the valuation of a big tech company and Unilever that makes most of the toothpastes of, you know, what we wash with around the world --</p><p>WARD: Yes.</p><p>LACQUA: -- does this valuation make sense?</p><p>WARD: Well, I would argue that a lot of the tech companies are more attractively valued than the toothpaste companies. Again, it gets back to the real growth prospects currently and prospectively where it's really hard to grow your share in a slow growth world, in a world where labor --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- the population growth in Western Europe and Japan is shrinking.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: The labor force in China is shrinking. U.S. is not doing that well either on that front.</p><p>KEENE: Let's draw the pros (ph) used on a terminal. Bring the terminal up. A little hard to read on television, even harder read on radio, but we're going to do it.</p><p>Here's Unilever's growth rate. OK, negative 1 percent. Revenue growth rate, negative 1 percent, positive 2 percent, negative 5 percent. The view out, negative 5, maybe they flat line 18 months from now. That is totally unacceptable --</p><p>WARD: Correct.</p><p>KEENE: -- under any circumstances so a CEO has to do. What will American multinationals do given this trigonous of revenue?</p><p>WARD: Well, it's all very similar and they're all scrambling trying to find the next great thing, whether it's some sort of non-soda drink that --</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: -- less sugar in it that can make you workout longer.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: Or whether it's a new version of coffee, so.</p><p>KEENE: I want to tees forward, Howard, to Apple. We're going to do Apple computer with Howard Ward. Bring up the screen again to -- (INAUDIBLE) we're working to Jason. Jason is going sad Friday. This is way too much camerawork.</p><p>Here we are, Apple up 14 percent revenue growth, maybe out a year up 16 percent revenue growth. And then these three gets conservative, terrible 6 percent revenue growth. What are differences there to Apple? We'll talk about this versus the stodgy consumer companies here in a moment, back to economics as we can.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds on failure of Apple. Bring up the chart here. It's a terrible chart. It's a chart of failure and it all comes down and I think of your wonderful colleague, Haverty, Lawrence Haverty.</p><p>We're all going to die. We're all going to die. We're all going to die. And once we go up again, here's the new toy. And lo and behold, Howard, once again, we've got, you know, the iPhone XS, I guess it's going to be a success. We got to get use to this, right? The iPhone is a failure, right?</p><p>WARD: Tom, it's the most spectacular consumer product ever. There's never been a money maker like it.</p><p>KEENE: Can you buy the persistency of cash flow?</p><p>WARD: Until proven otherwise, yes. I mean, Tom, not only is the company surprising with rolling out even bigger screens and whatnot, but nobody expected the ASPs on the phones to be rising at this point --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- in the company's life cycle. They are suppose to -- they were supposed to be declining years ago and they're continuing to go up and they're continuing to sell out of the most expensive phones.</p><p>And this, Tom, is -- this is not the latest iteration of the Apple watch, this is the Gen 3, not the Gen 4. But my fancy Swiss mechanical watch is sitting on my bureau --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- and this is my baby now.</p><p>KEENE: Again, the Apple watch chart, Howard, show pulling up for radio. I want to talk about the people that aren't Howard Ward. And Michael Purves had a fabulous article over at Weeden about the pressure in October, in November, I'm behind by X number of basis point. I've got to catch up to the benchmark, which means you must buy Apple to readjust 119. Is that going to happen? Are people little going to be forced to buy Apple?</p><p>WARD: Yes, some people will be forced to buy Apple. They will feel the pressure to buy Apple and buy some -- buying some of the other big things, stocks as well. These have been the big money makers in the stock market. There is no sense at this point that that's going to end anytime soon.</p><p>LACQUA: All right. It shows me a contender. Howard, you're absolutely right when it comes to wearables, Apple watch remains the best- selling. I think they shoot some 4.7 million. But is there going to be something coming from China that will actually hurt Apple sales? Will they be able to get market share?</p><p>WARD: Well, China is, you know, because of the current trade negotiations that are taking place to China, on a short-term basis, that's a little bit of an uncertain situation. So let me talk about the trade situation for a moment.</p><p>Canada and Mexico, we've got a new deal there with some minor concessions, not a big deal. China is a different animal altogether. The trade situation with China, that negotiation is going to take longer. It's more complex. It's going to be more difficult. It's going to stretch in the next year. It could take place for some time.</p><p>But let's go back to the basic principle that's driving the Trump administration's logic, which is that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China, OK. We are not the biggest -- our exports are 13 percent of GDP, that makes us one of the smallest export driven countries in the world. That's the percentage of our total economy.</p><p>All of these countries needed us more than we need them. So therefore, a trade war is likely to hurt them more than it will hurt us, although any trade war is likely to hurt everybody to some extend.</p><p>But the theory is that we can outlast China and gain concessions and China does need to change its industrial policy. It has been taking advantage of the United States. And now, of course, we have this new disclosure this week that there is some evidence that China had been implanting chips and hacking into a number of new technology companies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA: OK. So that's a Bloomberg scoop that we've been -- which I just wanted to ask you, actually. This is, you know, it was a Bloomberg Businessweek scoop, Howard.</p><p>And let me remind all of our viewers and listeners on radio on how China used the tiny chip to infiltrate about 30 U.S. companies. Does it make a difference to the supply chain of Apple, of Amazon and others? And does it mean that actually the -- if they do change the supply chain, their costs will go up?</p><p>WARD: Yes. So my guess is that there will be some changes at the margin that will take place overtime. However, the cost issue is an interesting one because the big cost advantage that manufacturers had in China five years ago is basically gone now.</p><p>Hard to believe, but wages have risen dramatically in China, cost of doing business here in the United States, including taxes, has gone down. You still have that transportation costs to bring goods over from China.</p><p>So, the United States has actually become very fertile ground for new manufacturing plants. And so there will be an adjustment even without this latest news about what China did or didn't do regarding this 30 U.S. tech company.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: The incentive for companies to build plant and equipment, the CapEx here in the United States is greater than it has been in years.</p><p>LACQUA: Howard, thank you. Howard Ward there of Gabelli Funds stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Right now, Carl Riccadonna to get us started, our Chief U.S. Economist. Carl, I want to show a chart which to me is the single most stunning social and optimistic chart on the Bloomberg.</p><p>This is claims -- weekly claims as compared to the employed of America back 62 years -- excuse me, 52 years. And it's stunning to me, Carl, how here it was a beautiful, wonderful market here and here and here and we have this absolute original anomaly of those no claims versus the market. It's more perfectly employed, aren't we?</p><p>CARL RICCADONNA, BLOOMBERG CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST: Well, we're close to the perfect point and one wouldn't guess that given the three handle on the unemployment rate you would think that we are potentially overheating, but dynamics have changed in the labor market and 3.8 percent, 3.9 percent unemployment doesn't mean what it used to for what pressures (ph) in the economy.</p><p>KEENE: The number one mail I get other than why did I listen to Howard Ward on Apple is the simple question, we're not fully employed. Carl Riccadonna is wrong. John Williams is wrong with Michael McKee today. We're not fully employed, that's what we hear.</p><p>RICCADONNA: We know we're fully employed when we cross through full employment because we start to get more wage pressures in the economy. And so it didn't happen at 5.5 percent. It didn't happen at 4.5 percent. It seems to be finally happening now that we're crossing below 4 percent unemployment.</p><p>So, again, we can't just look at the unemployment rate, we have to look at a broader array of labor indicators, including wage pressures and full employment to something that you can recognize in the rearview mirror. We're starting to see that now.</p><p>So, if we look at the course of wage pressures, we can say, yes, it's weak relative to past cycles. But the -- as you say, Tom, the vector is upward sloping finally in 2018 and that gives us confidence that, yes, we finally are hitting the sweet spot for the labor market.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Carl, what does that mean for the Fed?</p><p>RICCADONNA: What that means for the Fed is I think they will have more confidence that the economy is on a sturdy footing and can handle a few more rate increases. And we see that express in the treasury market earlier this week.</p><p>The manufacturing ISM came in much stronger than expected. Well, that's a good signal that growth will be solid in the second half of the year, not as solid as we saw in the second quarter, but it will be on a firm trajectory.</p><p>And so the market is starting to have fewer doubts about what the Fed is signaling and also looking for a more robust outlook over the longer run, which is why we see the long end of the curve moving higher as well. In fact, moving up more so than the short end of the curve.</p><p>LACQUA: Carl, if you look at the, you know, significant repricing in treasuries on Wednesday, what do you think the Fed would have made of that?</p><p>RICCADONNA: Well, I think they would maybe see some signs that finally, right, the Fed has been tightening, tightening, tightening, and it's not being reflected in financial conditions.</p><p>Finally this week we see that they are getting tractions, whether it's the backup in treasury yields or also the pullback in equity markets, this is the tightening of financial conditions that the Fed is trying to have come about in a very smooth and orderly fashion, not uncoincidentally the ECB reduce the pace of asset purchases this week and the Fed also opened the spigot a bit further in terms of balance sheet unwind. The fact that happened to the same week that Italian debt move and treasury move, I think is not a coincidence.</p><p>KEENE: I want to bring both of you. Howard, I'm going to go to you first. This is not firm payrolls, all sorts of moving averages of where we are just below 200,000, a huge shock. And I'm hearing Howard Ward whisper numbers that are way higher than what Carl Riccadonna's used to.</p><p>It is to make America great economy. But from where you sit looking at equities, do we sustain that economy that gives us 250,000, 300,000 or 400,000 monthly employment whisper numbers?</p><p>WARD: Well, I think we're still enjoying the surge that the economy has experienced from the tax reform, which has resulted in 20 percent gains in earnings this year and has helped the employment picture. And I think as the labor pool shrinks and as skilled labor becomes more difficult to find, which is happening, and as wage prices rise. I think wages are up --</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- to eight (ph) in the last 12 months. That's going to go 2 percent, 3 percent soon, I believe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD: So we're not going to be sustaining 250, 220. I think that number is going to be more like 175 for the next 12 months, 150 --.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: -- 175, not 200.</p><p>KEENE: If we go back to the chart, please, you can hardly see this on the chart because I messed up the actual series. And we've got the moving averages here all clustered in here, Carl. Way back here in 2010 is a blowout number. Are we going to see a blowout number today? I'm hearing this whispered, 350, 340, 400.</p><p>RICCADONA: So that 2010 number was partly related to what all of these flips higher to conduct the 10-year senses in the U.S.</p><p>KEENE: OK. Well, a lot of people are higher for Red Sox, Yankees playoffs, right?</p><p>RICCADONA: In that period, wage pressures were extremely low. So if the economy is growing fast then, of course, with faster GDP, you get faster hiring. Howard is exactly spot on to the notion now that we're having constraints in the labor market.</p><p>So even if you're having a fast quarter in those demands for labor, you might not have those very robust payroll gains because workers simply are not available or if you have to coax them to join your firm, you have to offer higher paychecks.</p><p>WARD: Tom, you being a statistician, you know it very well. You got to smooth those numbers. One most (ph) numbers don't mean anything, you know that. And they get revised. They get revised.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA: There you go. Tom, you get extra points for that. Howard, when you look at dollar dynamics, what does dollar do from here?</p><p>WARD: Dollar continues to be in an upturn. Why? Because the U.S. is out railing the rest of the world and because we have the strong interest rate differential already and the Fed is still tightening. So I want to see how the dollar does anything by continue to trend higher over the coming months.</p><p>RICCADONNA: Francine, just to that point I would say that, you know, in addition to that, what we've seen is when central banks moved from unconventional policy easing towards tightening, they ultimately have to move more slowly than expected.</p><p>And if that is true for the ECB as well, then that means, again, whether it's interest rate differentials or just tightening of normalization of policy, the Fed is way out ahead of everyone else, not just interest rates, but also balance sheet and that argues for a stronger dollar.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD: -- if you look at the emerging market bonds.</p><p>LACQUA: Right, exactly. Does the Fed need to look at the dollar dynamics? Maybe they don't say it because any contagion from emerging markets, because a lot of the countries are, of course, dollar denominated debt rich, do they need to watch out because if the dollar gets too high, this goes against the purpose of what the Fed is trying to do?</p><p>WARD: The Fed is going to look at that. You're right, they're not going to ever admit that they care about that. But they have to understand that global growth actually slowed this year in Europe, Japan, and China. The U.S. was the only major economic region that had an acceleration in growth this year. And next year, we're going to be slowing too.</p><p>We have peak growth in the second quarter, so in a world where global growth is slowing, where there's a lot of issues about debt and dollar denominated debt in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging markets, yes, the Fed is going to look at that, they'll take it into consideration. It's not a priority for them, but they can't ignore it. They'll never admit that they care about it.</p><p>LACQUA: All right, Carl and Howard, thank you. Carl Riccadonna there from Bloomberg. Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE: Single best chart, you do that on Bloomberg Surveillance with your guest. And Francine and I are advantage by Howard Ward of Gabelli, who seen history provides a wonderful temple to stock selection and active management.</p><p>It's a Dow, I've shown this a lot over the last several days. All of the Dow members normalize back to the beginning of a crisis, Apple, Visa, Nike, and a couple others down here and then the bundle.</p><p>Then why is everybody putting their money in the bundle, Howard? Why is everybody buying all of the Dow instead of trying to pick out these? And as you know, Howard, not pick out the group down here, including GE?</p><p>WARD: Yes. Well, I guess there is some safety in what is perceived to be less risky stocks. But perhaps certainly the stocks that have been the best performers are sometimes pricey and they'll have setbacks. But when you look at the two big winners there, Apple and Visa, those are not what anybody would characterize as that type of crazy stocks, the terrific businesses.</p><p>KEENE: Right. I have not done a survey about August and Graham done (INAUDIBLE). There's not much in price to sales, I go back to time Galvin (ph) and DLJ and Credit Suisse a million years ago. We're in a price to sales zero, aren't we?</p><p>WARD: Yes, to some extent, certainly for the most rapidly growing younger companies. But if you take Apple for an instance, let's look at Apple as an enterprise value. I headed up earlier about $975 billion. They're going to generate about $65 billion in free cash flow this year. So your multiple of free cash flow is, what, 15?</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: And the free cash flow in the last 12 months has advanced about 20 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>WARD: And, you know, even when revenues slow down in another year, they're going to be 5 plus percent. Revenue growth this year, in this big year for the S&amp;P, is 4.5 percent.</p><p>KEENE: Right. What's critical year, Francine, is the free cash flow of Apple is not back to but almost back to where it was before their new dividend in cash policy. It's a remarkable growth.</p><p>LACQUA: Yes. It is a remarkable. I really like your charts, Tom, today. And actually, if you do want to steal some of Tom's charts, I suggest you do right for the weekend. Just go into GTv Go. But, Howard the crucial question is like this is fine as long as there's not a downturn. It's fine as long as there's not a perfect storm actually hitting a lot of equities. Where do you see the biggest risk coming from?</p><p>WARD: Well, you know what, in terms of some of these thing (ph) types of stocks, not necessarily Apple so much, but some of the other ones, I see the risk is government regulation. I think that they're -- you know, this is something that's going on in the background, lots of talk about how to regulate some of these behemoths. And I think that poses a risk to those companies.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm going to go back to that monetary tightening. The interest rates have doubled in the last two years. The global PMI for manufacturing has declined in eight of the nine months so far this year, just over 52 right now. That's how been highly correlated to growth here and to the stock market here.</p><p>And so I would really focus on that and with the Fed between raising rates, they're going to do it again in December, it looks like. You've got quantitative tightening now at the rate of $600 billion annually while they're shrinking their balance sheet.</p><p>The lag time between raising rates and hitting the economy is 18 months to two years. A lot of tightening in the pipeline, 60 percent increase in the price of oil since June of '17, that hits with a lag of about a year so that's now starting to hit. The rise in the dollar up about 7 percent since April and trending higher, that's the headwind for growth.</p><p>So I do think that, you know, we're moving into a slower growth period. I think the Fed has the risk here of over tightening, the telegraphing in addition to the December hike, two hikes next year.</p><p>So, you know, what happen to three steps and a stumble? So far we're eight steps, eight tightening and you don't even see that when you look at the S&amp;P 500. But you do see it when you look at some of the subindices, if you look at the auto group, the homebuilding group. The interest rate sensitive groups are experiencing real pressure in the stock market and in the real economy.</p><p>LACQUA: Right. So how do you protect yourself against that, right? Do you go to yen? Is there part of your portfolio that you have to hedge?</p><p>WARD: Defensive growth companies which have led the market this year and which everyone thinks have been exhausted there in what they can do, but I disagree. But as long as the Fed is tightening, I want to stay away from the more cyclical names, the more value names. I want to stick with defensive growth. What's worked I think will continue to work, obviously not every day or week.</p><p>KEENE: Howard Ward with us, and we'll continue this conversation with Jon Ferro of Bloomberg Surveillance on the radio worldwide.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

You got it wrong.  I got it wrong.  Lori  (ph) on the floor over here got it wrong.  Howard Ward got it right.  He's  at Gabelli Funds and he said, \"Courage, be in the market.\"  We get an  update from Mr. Ward.  Are you still in the market?</p><p>HOWARD WARD, CIO OF GROWTH EQUITIES, GABELLI FUNDS:  Got to be, Tom.   Got to be in this market, stock markets in a confirmed up trend, the  economic fundamentals are quite good.</p><p>We've had a little bit of a backup in yields that's poof the market  yesterday but that too shall pass.  And there's no recession on -- there's  a recession on the horizon, Tom, but it's too far away to see right now.</p><p>KEENE:  The marginal change agent for big multinationals there are the  lofty valuation is the fear of being taken out.  We see that with Unilever,  Kraft went after them in London.  They're trying to go to Rotterdam or  whatever they're trying to do.  The fact is with the multiples that you and  I think are unseemly, private big money wants those big companies, don't  they?</p><p>WARD:  Function of interest rates, Tom, and the lack of growth.  And  so companies --</p><p>KEENE:  You're buying growth.</p><p>WARD:  You're buying growth and your financing is still very cheap.   This 3 percent rates for treasuries are still extremely low as a benchmark  rate and so financing is available and why not?  I mean, this is what  companies have to do.  Unilever consumer staples up.  The world has almost  no real growth in it and so you've got to go out and acquire.</p><p>FRANCINE LACQUA, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  All right, Howard, what does that  mean for -- I don't know what the story of Unilab -- Unilever really is or  the repercussions.  Is it, you know, shareholders saying, \"Well, we don't  understand the rules in the Netherlands.\"  Is it that, you know, what  exactly is it about?  Is it -- how humiliating is it for the chief  executive, but even the prime minister of the Netherlands that was trying  to do a better deal for dividend holders really to keep Unilever there?</p><p>WARD:  Well, that's the whole drama that I'm not well versed in.  But  here's the basic point that I want to make regarding Unilever and the  entire consumer staples area of the market.  You're looking at companies  that have top line growth of 2 percent to 3 percent, essentially.  That's  nominal.  That's not even real.</p><p>And so these companies are trying to restructure, acquire, divest, do  whatever they have to do in order to make their top and bottom lines grow  and get a little bit of multiple on that, generate cash flow, buyback  stock, raise dividends, reward shareholders.  It's a slog.  It's a grind  for these companies.  They have been underperforming the stock market now  all year and I suspect that's going to continue for some time.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  But how would you get also -- I mean, is the  valuation wrong?  I know it's been a slog, but if you look at, you know,  the valuation of a big tech company and Unilever that makes most of the  toothpastes of, you know, what we wash with around the world --</p><p>WARD:  Yes.</p><p>LACQUA:  -- does this valuation make sense?</p><p>WARD:  Well, I would argue that a lot of the tech companies are more  attractively valued than the toothpaste companies.  Again, it gets back to  the real growth prospects currently and prospectively where it's really  hard to grow your share in a slow growth world, in a world where labor --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- the population growth in Western Europe and Japan is  shrinking.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  The labor force in China is shrinking.  U.S. is not doing that  well either on that front.</p><p>KEENE:  Let's draw the pros (ph) used on a terminal.  Bring the  terminal up.  A little hard to read on television, even harder read on  radio, but we're going to do it.</p><p>Here's Unilever's growth rate.  OK, negative 1 percent.  Revenue  growth rate, negative 1 percent, positive 2 percent, negative 5 percent.   The view out, negative 5, maybe they flat line 18 months from now.  That is  totally unacceptable --</p><p>WARD:  Correct.</p><p>KEENE:  -- under any circumstances so a CEO has to do.  What will  American multinationals do given this trigonous of revenue?</p><p>WARD:  Well, it's all very similar and they're all scrambling trying  to find the next great thing, whether it's some sort of non-soda drink that  --</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  -- less sugar in it that can make you workout longer.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  Or whether it's a new version of coffee, so.</p><p>KEENE:  I want to tees forward, Howard, to Apple.  We're going to do  Apple computer with Howard Ward.  Bring up the screen again to --  (INAUDIBLE) we're working to Jason.  Jason is going sad Friday.  This is  way too much camerawork.</p><p>Here we are, Apple up 14 percent revenue growth, maybe out a year up  16 percent revenue growth.  And then these three gets conservative,  terrible 6 percent revenue growth.  What are differences there to Apple?   We'll talk about this versus the stodgy consumer companies here in a  moment, back to economics as we can.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds on failure of Apple.  Bring up  the chart here.  It's a terrible chart.  It's a chart of failure and it all  comes down and I think of your wonderful colleague, Haverty, Lawrence  Haverty.</p><p>We're all going to die.  We're all going to die.  We're all going to  die.  And once we go up again, here's the new toy.  And lo and behold,  Howard, once again, we've got, you know, the iPhone XS, I guess it's going  to be a success.  We got to get use to this, right?  The iPhone is a  failure, right?</p><p>WARD:  Tom, it's the most spectacular consumer product ever.  There's  never been a money maker like it.</p><p>KEENE:  Can you buy the persistency of cash flow?</p><p>WARD:  Until proven otherwise, yes.  I mean, Tom, not only is the  company surprising with rolling out even bigger screens and whatnot, but  nobody expected the ASPs on the phones to be rising at this point --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- in the company's life cycle.  They are suppose to -- they  were supposed to be declining years ago and they're continuing to go up and  they're continuing to sell out of the most expensive phones.</p><p>And this, Tom, is -- this is not the latest iteration of the Apple  watch, this is the Gen 3, not the Gen 4.  But my fancy Swiss mechanical  watch is sitting on my bureau --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- and this is my baby now.</p><p>KEENE:  Again, the Apple watch chart, Howard, show pulling up for  radio.  I want to talk about the people that aren't Howard Ward.  And  Michael Purves had a fabulous article over at Weeden about the pressure in  October, in November, I'm behind by X number of basis point.  I've got to  catch up to the benchmark, which means you must buy Apple to readjust 119.   Is that going to happen?  Are people little going to be forced to buy  Apple?</p><p>WARD:  Yes, some people will be forced to buy Apple.  They will feel  the pressure to buy Apple and buy some -- buying some of the other big  things, stocks as well.  These have been the big money makers in the stock  market.  There is no sense at this point that that's going to end anytime  soon.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right.  It shows me a contender.  Howard, you're  absolutely right when it comes to wearables, Apple watch remains the best- selling.  I think they shoot some 4.7 million.  But is there going to be  something coming from China that will actually hurt Apple sales?  Will they  be able to get market share?</p><p>WARD:  Well, China is, you know, because of the current trade  negotiations that are taking place to China, on a short-term basis, that's  a little bit of an uncertain situation.  So let me talk about the trade  situation for a moment.</p><p>Canada and Mexico, we've got a new deal there with some minor  concessions, not a big deal.  China is a different animal altogether.  The  trade situation with China, that negotiation is going to take longer.  It's  more complex.  It's going to be more difficult.  It's going to stretch in  the next year.  It could take place for some time.</p><p>But let's go back to the basic principle that's driving the Trump  administration's logic, which is that China needs the United States more  than the United States needs China, OK.  We are not the biggest -- our  exports are 13 percent of GDP, that makes us one of the smallest export  driven countries in the world.  That's the percentage of our total economy.</p><p>All of these countries needed us more than we need them.  So  therefore, a trade war is likely to hurt them more than it will hurt us,  although any trade war is likely to hurt everybody to some extend.</p><p>But the theory is that we can outlast China and gain concessions and  China does need to change its industrial policy.  It has been taking  advantage of the United States.  And now, of course, we have this new  disclosure this week that there is some evidence that China had been  implanting chips and hacking into a number of new technology companies.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA:  OK.  So that's a Bloomberg scoop that we've been -- which I  just wanted to ask you, actually.  This is, you know, it was a Bloomberg  Businessweek scoop, Howard.</p><p>And let me remind all of our viewers and listeners on radio on how  China used the tiny chip to infiltrate about 30 U.S. companies.  Does it  make a difference to the supply chain of Apple, of Amazon and others?  And  does it mean that actually the -- if they do change the supply chain, their  costs will go up?</p><p>WARD:  Yes.  So my guess is that there will be some changes at the  margin that will take place overtime.  However, the cost issue is an  interesting one because the big cost advantage that manufacturers had in  China five years ago is basically gone now.</p><p>Hard to believe, but wages have risen dramatically in China, cost of  doing business here in the United States, including taxes, has gone down.   You still have that transportation costs to bring goods over from China.</p><p>So, the United States has actually become very fertile ground for new  manufacturing plants.  And so there will be an adjustment even without this  latest news about what China did or didn't do regarding this 30 U.S. tech  company.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  The incentive for companies to build plant and equipment, the  CapEx here in the United States is greater than it has been in years.</p><p>LACQUA:  Howard, thank you.  Howard Ward there of Gabelli Funds stays  with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Right now, Carl Riccadonna to get us started, our Chief U.S.  Economist.  Carl, I want to show a chart which to me is the single most  stunning social and optimistic chart on the Bloomberg.</p><p>This is claims -- weekly claims as compared to the employed of America  back 62 years -- excuse me, 52 years.  And it's stunning to me, Carl, how  here it was a beautiful, wonderful market here and here and here and we  have this absolute original anomaly of those no claims versus the market.   It's more perfectly employed, aren't we?</p><p>CARL RICCADONNA, BLOOMBERG CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST:  Well, we're close to  the perfect point and one wouldn't guess that given the three handle on the  unemployment rate you would think that we are potentially overheating, but  dynamics have changed in the labor market and 3.8 percent, 3.9 percent  unemployment doesn't mean what it used to for what pressures (ph) in the  economy.</p><p>KEENE:  The number one mail I get other than why did I listen to  Howard Ward on Apple is the simple question, we're not fully employed.   Carl Riccadonna is wrong.  John Williams is wrong with Michael McKee today.   We're not fully employed, that's what we hear.</p><p>RICCADONNA:  We know we're fully employed when we cross through full  employment because we start to get more wage pressures in the economy.  And  so it didn't happen at 5.5 percent.  It didn't happen at 4.5 percent.  It  seems to be finally happening now that we're crossing below 4 percent  unemployment.</p><p>So, again, we can't just look at the unemployment rate, we have to  look at a broader array of labor indicators, including wage pressures and  full employment to something that you can recognize in the rearview mirror.   We're starting to see that now.</p><p>So, if we look at the course of wage pressures, we can say, yes, it's  weak relative to past cycles.  But the -- as you say, Tom, the vector is  upward sloping finally in 2018 and that gives us confidence that, yes, we  finally are hitting the sweet spot for the labor market.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Carl, what does that mean for the Fed?</p><p>RICCADONNA:  What that means for the Fed is I think they will have  more confidence that the economy is on a sturdy footing and can handle a  few more rate increases.  And we see that express in the treasury market  earlier this week.</p><p>The manufacturing ISM came in much stronger than expected.  Well,  that's a good signal that growth will be solid in the second half of the  year, not as solid as we saw in the second quarter, but it will be on a  firm trajectory.</p><p>And so the market is starting to have fewer doubts about what the Fed  is signaling and also looking for a more robust outlook over the longer  run, which is why we see the long end of the curve moving higher as well.   In fact, moving up more so than the short end of the curve.</p><p>LACQUA:  Carl, if you look at the, you know, significant repricing in  treasuries on Wednesday, what do you think the Fed would have made of that?</p><p>RICCADONNA:  Well, I think they would maybe see some signs that  finally, right, the Fed has been tightening, tightening, tightening, and  it's not being reflected in financial conditions.</p><p>Finally this week we see that they are getting tractions, whether it's  the backup in treasury yields or also the pullback in equity markets, this  is the tightening of financial conditions that the Fed is trying to have  come about in a very smooth and orderly fashion, not uncoincidentally the  ECB reduce the pace of asset purchases this week and the Fed also opened  the spigot a bit further in terms of balance sheet unwind.  The fact that  happened to the same week that Italian debt move and treasury move, I think  is not a coincidence.</p><p>KEENE:  I want to bring both of you.  Howard, I'm going to go to you  first.  This is not firm payrolls, all sorts of moving averages of where we  are just below 200,000, a huge shock.  And I'm hearing Howard Ward whisper  numbers that are way higher than what Carl Riccadonna's used to.</p><p>It is to make America great economy.  But from where you sit looking  at equities, do we sustain that economy that gives us 250,000, 300,000 or  400,000 monthly employment whisper numbers?</p><p>WARD:  Well, I think we're still enjoying the surge that the economy  has experienced from the tax reform, which has resulted in 20 percent gains  in earnings this year and has helped the employment picture.  And I think  as the labor pool shrinks and as skilled labor becomes more difficult to  find, which is happening, and as wage prices rise.  I think wages are up --</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- to eight (ph) in the last 12 months.  That's going to go 2  percent, 3 percent soon, I believe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD:  So we're not going to be sustaining 250, 220.  I think that  number is going to be more like 175 for the next 12 months, 150 --.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  -- 175, not 200.</p><p>KEENE:  If we go back to the chart, please, you can hardly see this on  the chart because I messed up the actual series.  And we've got the moving  averages here all clustered in here, Carl.  Way back here in 2010 is a  blowout number.  Are we going to see a blowout number today?  I'm hearing  this whispered, 350, 340, 400.</p><p>RICCADONA:  So that 2010 number was partly related to what all of  these flips higher to conduct the 10-year senses in the U.S.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Well, a lot of people are higher for Red Sox, Yankees  playoffs, right?</p><p>RICCADONA:  In that period, wage pressures were extremely low.  So if  the economy is growing fast then, of course, with faster GDP, you get  faster hiring.  Howard is exactly spot on to the notion now that we're  having constraints in the labor market.</p><p>So even if you're having a fast quarter in those demands for labor,  you might not have those very robust payroll gains because workers simply  are not available or if you have to coax them to join your firm, you have  to offer higher paychecks.</p><p>WARD:  Tom, you being a statistician, you know it very well.  You got  to smooth those numbers.  One most (ph) numbers don't mean anything, you  know that.  And they get revised.  They get revised.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACQUA:  There you go.  Tom, you get extra points for that.  Howard,  when you look at dollar dynamics, what does dollar do from here?</p><p>WARD:  Dollar continues to be in an upturn.  Why?  Because the U.S. is  out railing the rest of the world and because we have the strong interest  rate differential already and the Fed is still tightening.  So I want to  see how the dollar does anything by continue to trend higher over the  coming months.</p><p>RICCADONNA:  Francine, just to that point I would say that, you know,  in addition to that, what we've seen is when central banks moved from  unconventional policy easing towards tightening, they ultimately have to  move more slowly than expected.</p><p>And if that is true for the ECB as well, then that means, again,  whether it's interest rate differentials or just tightening of  normalization of policy, the Fed is way out ahead of everyone else, not  just interest rates, but also balance sheet and that argues for a stronger  dollar.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WARD:  -- if you look at the emerging market bonds.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right, exactly.  Does the Fed need to look at the dollar  dynamics?  Maybe they don't say it because any contagion from emerging  markets, because a lot of the countries are, of course, dollar denominated  debt rich, do they need to watch out because if the dollar gets too high,  this goes against the purpose of what the Fed is trying to do?</p><p>WARD:  The Fed is going to look at that.  You're right, they're not  going to ever admit that they care about that.  But they have to understand  that global growth actually slowed this year in Europe, Japan, and China.   The U.S. was the only major economic region that had an acceleration in  growth this year.  And next year, we're going to be slowing too.</p><p>We have peak growth in the second quarter, so in a world where global  growth is slowing, where there's a lot of issues about debt and dollar  denominated debt in foreign countries, particularly in the emerging  markets, yes, the Fed is going to look at that, they'll take it into  consideration.  It's not a priority for them, but they can't ignore it.   They'll never admit that they care about it.</p><p>LACQUA:  All right, Carl and Howard, thank you.  Carl Riccadonna there  from Bloomberg.  Howard Ward of Gabelli Funds stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>KEENE:  Single best chart, you do that on Bloomberg Surveillance with  your guest.  And Francine and I are advantage by Howard Ward of Gabelli,  who seen history provides a wonderful temple to stock selection and active  management.</p><p>It's a Dow, I've shown this a lot over the last several days.  All of  the Dow members normalize back to the beginning of a crisis, Apple, Visa,  Nike, and a couple others down here and then the bundle.</p><p>Then why is everybody putting their money in the bundle, Howard?  Why  is everybody buying all of the Dow instead of trying to pick out these?   And as you know, Howard, not pick out the group down here, including GE?</p><p>WARD:  Yes.  Well, I guess there is some safety in what is perceived  to be less risky stocks.  But perhaps certainly the stocks that have been  the best performers are sometimes pricey and they'll have setbacks.  But  when you look at the two big winners there, Apple and Visa, those are not  what anybody would characterize as that type of crazy stocks, the terrific  businesses.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.  I have not done a survey about August and Graham done  (INAUDIBLE).  There's not much in price to sales, I go back to time Galvin  (ph) and DLJ and Credit Suisse a million years ago.  We're in a price to  sales zero, aren't we?</p><p>WARD:  Yes, to some extent, certainly for the most rapidly growing  younger companies.  But if you take Apple for an instance, let's look at  Apple as an enterprise value.  I headed up earlier about $975 billion.   They're going to generate about $65 billion in free cash flow this year.   So your multiple of free cash flow is, what, 15?</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  And the free cash flow in the last 12 months has advanced about  20 percent.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.</p><p>WARD:  And, you know, even when revenues slow down in another year,  they're going to be 5 plus percent.  Revenue growth this year, in this big  year for the S&amp;P, is 4.5 percent.</p><p>KEENE:  Right.  What's critical year, Francine, is the free cash flow  of Apple is not back to but almost back to where it was before their new  dividend in cash policy.  It's a remarkable growth.</p><p>LACQUA:  Yes.  It is a remarkable.  I really like your charts, Tom,  today.  And actually, if you do want to steal some of Tom's charts, I  suggest you do right for the weekend.  Just go into GTv Go.  But, Howard  the crucial question is like this is fine as long as there's not a  downturn.  It's fine as long as there's not a perfect storm actually  hitting a lot of equities.  Where do you see the biggest risk coming from?</p><p>WARD:  Well, you know what, in terms of some of these thing (ph) types  of stocks, not necessarily Apple so much, but some of the other ones, I see  the risk is government regulation.  I think that they're -- you know, this  is something that's going on in the background, lots of talk about how to  regulate some of these behemoths.  And I think that poses a risk to those  companies.</p><p>Otherwise, I'm going to go back to that monetary tightening.  The  interest rates have doubled in the last two years.  The global PMI for  manufacturing has declined in eight of the nine months so far this year,  just over 52 right now.  That's how been highly correlated to growth here  and to the stock market here.</p><p>And so I would really focus on that and with the Fed between raising  rates, they're going to do it again in December, it looks like.  You've got  quantitative tightening now at the rate of $600 billion annually while  they're shrinking their balance sheet.</p><p>The lag time between raising rates and hitting the economy is 18  months to two years.  A lot of tightening in the pipeline, 60 percent  increase in the price of oil since June of '17, that hits with a lag of  about a year so that's now starting to hit.  The rise in the dollar up  about 7 percent since April and trending higher, that's the headwind for  growth.</p><p>So I do think that, you know, we're moving into a slower growth  period.  I think the Fed has the risk here of over tightening, the  telegraphing in addition to the December hike, two hikes next year.</p><p>So, you know, what happen to three steps and a stumble?  So far we're  eight steps, eight tightening and you don't even see that when you look at  the S&amp;P 500.  But you do see it when you look at some of the subindices, if  you look at the auto group, the homebuilding group.  The interest rate  sensitive groups are experiencing real pressure in the stock market and in  the real economy.</p><p>LACQUA:  Right.  So how do you protect yourself against that, right?   Do you go to yen?  Is there part of your portfolio that you have to hedge?</p><p>WARD:  Defensive growth companies which have led the market this year  and which everyone thinks have been exhausted there in what they can do,  but I disagree.  But as long as the Fed is tightening, I want to stay away  from the more cyclical names, the more value names.  I want to stick with  defensive growth.  What's worked I think will continue to work, obviously  not every day or week.</p><p>KEENE:  Howard Ward with us, and we'll continue this conversation with  Jon Ferro of Bloomberg Surveillance on the radio worldwide.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Great to have you with us here.  </p><p>      And let me start with the news highly anticipated more detail and announcement from the White House from the big six on what tax reform is going to entail.  Of course, we've just been through another round of debate over healthcare reform.  How baked into when you -- because right now is the prospect for their being tax ground (ph), what kind of difference could it make at this point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  That's a good question, David.  I just have to believe that now that we have a stock market that priced at 19 times this year's earnings which is the highest multiple going back to the early 2000 and late '99 period.  I have to believe that a fair amount of a corporate tax rate discount is built in to evaluations.  </p><p>      Now, I'm sure we could filter through the market and on a stock by stock basis find some companies that would be particularly strong beneficiaries of a corporate tax reduction.  But I think overall, the market is expecting this and would be quite disappointed if it didn't happen.  I think it may not happen until next year.  But I think it probably will happen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  What stance to make the greatest difference?  Is it the corporate reduction or is it a -- if we see it, some sort of discount on repatriating profits held overseas.  What would make the biggest difference to these companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  The corporate tax rate reduction so that somebody who's paying 35 percent today could see their effective rate.  And there are companies like mine that pay that kind of rate.  We could see their rate fall to 20 percent would be biggest boost.  The repatriation would, I would call that a lower multiple event.  </p><p>      But for certain companies, particularly some of the big tech companies like Apple that have so much money in broad.  If they can bring that back, that's a certainly a good event for them to put that money to work.  And then it has implications, what did they do with that money is probably weren't be Adaptic and M&amp;A, but certainly in technology in some of these other industries where the money is off shore.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  How in opportune at time is it right now to get in to stocks?  It's something you counsel doing at this point when we see new records in the equities markets.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  Yes.  So I do think that this is the time to be cautious. You know, I've been probably saying be cautious for the last year. And so I may sound like a \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\".  But cautious doesn't mean that you're not invested that, you know, I think that the performance of my funds being up 18, 20 percent during this time period suggest you can be defensive and still have good returns.  </p><p>      But having said that, the market is essentially, let's call that at a record high.  And we've had a real change in the stance of the Fed from quantitative easing and lowering rates to the beginning of a quantitative tightening and raising rates. </p><p>      And I think that presents a problem for the market.  With the passage of time, the Fed is now tightening four times.  They're telegraphing a fifth tightening this December.  They're telegraphing three more tightenings next year and beginning next month.  They start to let the bonds roll off the balance sheet without reinvesting.  </p><p>      So, I do think that the change in the Fed presents a growing problem for the market particularly at a point in time when valuations are stretched and we haven't had a correction of any magnitude, 5, 10, 15 percent for it really historically long time.  So, I think you have to be cautious.  This could be the worst time to be committing new cash to the market since the beginning of this bull market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  That's -- it's quite a statement from the great optimist.  But with that said, how should our listeners fear a correction?  And the answer is you don't fear correction.  It's part of the game.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  That's exactly right.  You know, I make the analogy to someone who is lifting weights to build up muscle.  The way that happens is you have to tear the muscle down for it to rebuild itself. And for the stock markets are really have a continued uprisings in a long term bull market.  You have to occasionally break it down and lose the weaker holders and reduce expectations so that the bull market can continue.  </p><p>      So it is a normal part of the process.  It's just a normal part of the process that has been missing for quite sometime.  I mean just at the 5 percent level, we usually have 3, 5 percent corrections every year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Every year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  We had four in the last two years.  We have it one so far this year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I mean, David, you don't even know what a bear mark guru (ph) is, and you don't know the bear market is.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  We normally have one 10 percent correction every year, it hasn't happened.  It's the longest period of time that we haven't had a 15 percent correction since 1999.  So these are worth paying attention to particularly with the market at this level.  And you not only have some concern about the changing monetary policy.  But you do have some real headline risk with North Korea.  We all tend to dismiss it and ignore it because North Korea has been a thorn in our side for years.  And it has never amount to anything.  </p><p>      But that doesn't mean it won't become a bigger problem, one that we do have to really focus on this year.  So, you know, that's a headline risk catalyst.  Other than that, I mean I'm amazed that the resiliency of this economy, the U.S. economy is incredibly durable. And we are, you know, now entering the ninth year of economic expansion and the ninth year of a bull market.  It's very impressive.  </p><p>      But, you know, historically, these are getting dated.  They're getting pretty old.  You know, at some point we're going to have a little bit of a recession.  Hopefully, it's not brought on by the Fed. But that's possible.  But regardless, you know, at some point out there over the next year or two, we need to be prepared for more difficult times.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GURA</emphasis>:  Talk about how the Fed telegraphs, we heard from the head telegraph operator yesterday, Avalon Cleveland.  And she, Janet Yellen was in respective to my ears at least didn't talked about the difficulties that has had forecasting.  I guess gave some indications where we might see another hike in December.  What did you hear from her yesterday?  And what is that introspection, that focused on ground (ph) rules and tell you about the way the Fed is operating, what we could expect here over this next few months?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  Well, the Fed is moving gradually I suppose off of the low base.  But, you know, it has now moved four times since December of '15.  The fifth time scheduled for this December.  So, it is moving. She doesn't -- she think there's a risk that the -- if they don't move, you know, at a reasonable pace.  She doesn't want to move too slowly, in other words and let the inflation out of the bottle and impatient (ph) genie out of the bottle.  So, that's a risk.  </p><p>      I think she's over stating that risk presently because we don't see an inflation as a problem right now, the PCE deflater which the Fed focuses on is running one-sixth, one-seventh.  The expectations are relatively low for inflation.  The Fed's target is 2 percent.  So, I think she may be overly focused on that right now.  And to detriment of policy particularly at a point in time when we know the economic data is going to look a little lousy between now and your end because of the hurricanes.  </p><p>      But we don't know how much of that will not be due to the hurricanes.  And the Fed is going to dismiss it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You've been very generous of your time today.  Just quickly here of the financials, I'm sorry, I didn't bring up.  Are you a big owner of banks here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  I'm not a big owner of banks which tends to be, you know, more of a value investors favorite.  I think the banks are offering pretty good value.  I think there's a capital returns toward there, the benefiting from the more favorable regulatory environment for sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARD</emphasis>:  You know, among the big banks, I like J.P. Morgan.  I think it's the best manage (ph) of the big banks and like Jamie Dimon is a terrific CEO.  The one bank that I own in my domestic fund is First Republic Bank in San Francisco.  It's really a growth bank.  It has done a terrific job catering to the very wealthy people in their various pockets mostly on the west coast, but east coast as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  OK.  Very good Howard Ward, thank you so much with Gabelli, greatly appreciate perspective and particularly the bit we did on general electorate, look for that out on Bloomberg videos very, very accurate.  He's beginning to acquire shares of fortress planner.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Great to have you with us here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let me start with the news highly anticipated more detail and announcement from the White House from the big six on what tax reform is going to entail. Of course, we've just been through another round of debate over healthcare reform. How baked into when you -- because right now is the prospect for their being tax ground (ph), what kind of difference could it make at this point?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HOWARD WARD, CIO, GABELLI FUND: That's a good question, David. I just have to believe that now that we have a stock market that priced at 19 times this year's earnings which is the highest multiple going back to the early 2000 and late '99 period. I have to believe that a fair amount of a corporate tax rate discount is built in to evaluations.</p><p>Now, I'm sure we could filter through the market and on a stock by stock basis find some companies that would be particularly strong beneficiaries of a corporate tax reduction. But I think overall, the market is expecting this and would be quite disappointed if it didn't happen. I think it may not happen until next year. But I think it probably will happen.</p><p>GURA: What stance to make the greatest difference? Is it the corporate reduction or is it a -- if we see it, some sort of discount on repatriating profits held overseas. What would make the biggest difference to these companies?</p><p>WARD: The corporate tax rate reduction so that somebody who's paying 35 percent today could see their effective rate. And there are companies like mine that pay that kind of rate. We could see their rate fall to 20 percent would be biggest boost. The repatriation would, I would call that a lower multiple event.</p><p>But for certain companies, particularly some of the big tech companies like Apple that have so much money in broad. If they can bring that back, that's a certainly a good event for them to put that money to work. And then it has implications, what did they do with that money is probably weren't be Adaptic and M&amp;A, but certainly in technology in some of these other industries where the money is off shore.</p><p>GURA: How in opportune at time is it right now to get in to stocks? It's something you counsel doing at this point when we see new records in the equities markets.</p><p>WARD: Yes. So I do think that this is the time to be cautious. You know, I've been probably saying be cautious for the last year. And so I may sound like a \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\". But cautious doesn't mean that you're not invested that, you know, I think that the performance of my funds being up 18, 20 percent during this time period suggest you can be defensive and still have good returns.</p><p>But having said that, the market is essentially, let's call that at a record high. And we've had a real change in the stance of the Fed from quantitative easing and lowering rates to the beginning of a quantitative tightening and raising rates.</p><p>And I think that presents a problem for the market. With the passage of time, the Fed is now tightening four times. They're telegraphing a fifth tightening this December. They're telegraphing three more tightenings next year and beginning next month. They start to let the bonds roll off the balance sheet without reinvesting.</p><p>So, I do think that the change in the Fed presents a growing problem for the market particularly at a point in time when valuations are stretched and we haven't had a correction of any magnitude, 5, 10, 15 percent for it really historically long time. So, I think you have to be cautious. This could be the worst time to be committing new cash to the market since the beginning of this bull market.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: OK. That's -- it's quite a statement from the great optimist. But with that said, how should our listeners fear a correction? And the answer is you don't fear correction. It's part of the game.</p><p>WARD: That's exactly right. You know, I make the analogy to someone who is lifting weights to build up muscle. The way that happens is you have to tear the muscle down for it to rebuild itself. And for the stock markets are really have a continued uprisings in a long term bull market. You have to occasionally break it down and lose the weaker holders and reduce expectations so that the bull market can continue.</p><p>So it is a normal part of the process. It's just a normal part of the process that has been missing for quite sometime. I mean just at the 5 percent level, we usually have 3, 5 percent corrections every year.</p><p>KEENE: Every year.</p><p>WARD: We had four in the last two years. We have it one so far this year.</p><p>KEENE: I mean, David, you don't even know what a bear mark guru (ph) is, and you don't know the bear market is.</p><p>WARD: We normally have one 10 percent correction every year, it hasn't happened. It's the longest period of time that we haven't had a 15 percent correction since 1999. So these are worth paying attention to particularly with the market at this level. And you not only have some concern about the changing monetary policy. But you do have some real headline risk with North Korea. We all tend to dismiss it and ignore it because North Korea has been a thorn in our side for years. And it has never amount to anything.</p><p>But that doesn't mean it won't become a bigger problem, one that we do have to really focus on this year. So, you know, that's a headline risk catalyst. Other than that, I mean I'm amazed that the resiliency of this economy, the U.S. economy is incredibly durable. And we are, you know, now entering the ninth year of economic expansion and the ninth year of a bull market. It's very impressive.</p><p>But, you know, historically, these are getting dated. They're getting pretty old. You know, at some point we're going to have a little bit of a recession. Hopefully, it's not brought on by the Fed. But that's possible. But regardless, you know, at some point out there over the next year or two, we need to be prepared for more difficult times.</p><p>GURA: Talk about how the Fed telegraphs, we heard from the head telegraph operator yesterday, Avalon Cleveland. And she, Janet Yellen was in respective to my ears at least didn't talked about the difficulties that has had forecasting. I guess gave some indications where we might see another hike in December. What did you hear from her yesterday? And what is that introspection, that focused on ground (ph) rules and tell you about the way the Fed is operating, what we could expect here over this next few months?</p><p>WARD: Well, the Fed is moving gradually I suppose off of the low base. But, you know, it has now moved four times since December of '15. The fifth time scheduled for this December. So, it is moving. She doesn't -- she think there's a risk that the -- if they don't move, you know, at a reasonable pace. She doesn't want to move too slowly, in other words and let the inflation out of the bottle and impatient (ph) genie out of the bottle. So, that's a risk.</p><p>I think she's over stating that risk presently because we don't see an inflation as a problem right now, the PCE deflater which the Fed focuses on is running one-sixth, one-seventh. The expectations are relatively low for inflation. The Fed's target is 2 percent. So, I think she may be overly focused on that right now. And to detriment of policy particularly at a point in time when we know the economic data is going to look a little lousy between now and your end because of the hurricanes.</p><p>But we don't know how much of that will not be due to the hurricanes. And the Fed is going to dismiss it.</p><p>KEENE: You've been very generous of your time today. Just quickly here of the financials, I'm sorry, I didn't bring up. Are you a big owner of banks here?</p><p>WARD: I'm not a big owner of banks which tends to be, you know, more of a value investors favorite. I think the banks are offering pretty good value. I think there's a capital returns toward there, the benefiting from the more favorable regulatory environment for sure.</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>WARD: You know, among the big banks, I like J.P.

What would make the biggest difference to these  companies?</p><p>WARD:  The corporate tax rate reduction so that somebody who's paying 35  percent today could see their effective rate.  And there are companies like  mine that pay that kind of rate.  We could see their rate fall to 20  percent would be biggest boost.  The repatriation would, I would call that  a lower multiple event.</p><p>But for certain companies, particularly some of the big tech companies like  Apple that have so much money in broad.  If they can bring that back,  that's a certainly a good event for them to put that money to work.  And  then it has implications, what did they do with that money is probably  weren't be Adaptic and M&amp;A, but certainly in technology in some of these  other industries where the money is off shore.</p><p>GURA:  How in opportune at time is it right now to get in to stocks?  It's  something you counsel doing at this point when we see new records in the  equities markets.</p><p>WARD:  Yes.  So I do think that this is the time to be cautious.  You know,  I've been probably saying be cautious for the last year.  And so I may  sound like a \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\".  But cautious doesn't mean that you're  not invested that, you know, I think that the performance of my funds being  up 18, 20 percent during this time period suggest you can be defensive and  still have good returns.</p><p>But having said that, the market is essentially, let's call that at a  record high.  And we've had a real change in the stance of the Fed from  quantitative easing and lowering rates to the beginning of a quantitative  tightening and raising rates.</p><p>And I think that presents a problem for the market.  With the passage of  time, the Fed is now tightening four times.  They're telegraphing a fifth  tightening this December.  They're telegraphing three more tightenings next  year and beginning next month.  They start to let the bonds roll off the  balance sheet without reinvesting.</p><p>So, I do think that the change in the Fed presents a growing problem for  the market particularly at a point in time when valuations are stretched  and we haven't had a correction of any magnitude, 5, 10, 15 percent for it  really historically long time.  So, I think you have to be cautious.  This  could be the worst time to be committing new cash to the market since the  beginning of this bull market.</p><p>TOM KEENE, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  OK.  That's -- it's quite a statement from  the great optimist.  But with that said, how should our listeners fear a  correction?  And the answer is you don't fear correction.  It's part of the  game.</p><p>WARD:  That's exactly right.  You know, I make the analogy to someone who  is lifting weights to build up muscle.  The way that happens is you have to  tear the muscle down for it to rebuild itself.  And for the stock markets  are really have a continued uprisings in a long term bull market.  You have  to occasionally break it down and lose the weaker holders and reduce  expectations so that the bull market can continue.</p><p>So it is a normal part of the process.  It's just a normal part of the  process that has been missing for quite sometime.  I mean just at the 5  percent level, we usually have 3, 5 percent corrections every year.</p><p>KEENE:  Every year.</p><p>WARD:  We had four in the last two years.  We have it one so far this year.</p><p>KEENE:  I mean, David, you don't even know what a bear mark guru (ph) is,  and you don't know the bear market is.</p><p>WARD:  We normally have one 10 percent correction every year, it hasn't  happened.  It's the longest period of time that we haven't had a 15 percent  correction since 1999.  So these are worth paying attention to particularly  with the market at this level.  And you not only have some concern about  the changing monetary policy.  But you do have some real headline risk with  North Korea.  We all tend to dismiss it and ignore it because North Korea  has been a thorn in our side for years.  And it has never amount to  anything.</p><p>But that doesn't mean it won't become a bigger problem, one that we do have  to really focus on this year.  So, you know, that's a headline risk  catalyst.  Other than that, I mean I'm amazed that the resiliency of this  economy, the U.S. economy is incredibly durable.  And we are, you know, now  entering the ninth year of economic expansion and the ninth year of a bull  market.  It's very impressive.</p><p>But, you know, historically, these are getting dated.  They're getting  pretty old.  You know, at some point we're going to have a little bit of a  recession.  Hopefully, it's not brought on by the Fed.  But that's  possible.  But regardless, you know, at some point out there over the next  year or two, we need to be prepared for more difficult times.</p><p>GURA:  Talk about how the Fed telegraphs, we heard from the head telegraph  operator yesterday, Avalon Cleveland.  And she, Janet Yellen was in  respective to my ears at least didn't talked about the difficulties that  has had forecasting.  I guess gave some indications where we might see  another hike in December.  What did you hear from her yesterday?  And what  is that introspection, that focused on ground (ph) rules and tell you about  the way the Fed is operating, what we could expect here over this next few  months?</p><p>WARD:  Well, the Fed is moving gradually I suppose off of the low base.   But, you know, it has now moved four times since December of '15.  The  fifth time scheduled for this December.  So, it is moving.  She doesn't --  she think there's a risk that the -- if they don't move, you know, at a  reasonable pace.  She doesn't want to move too slowly, in other words and  let the inflation out of the bottle and impatient (ph) genie out of the  bottle.  So, that's a risk.</p><p>I think she's over stating that risk presently because we don't see an  inflation as a problem right now, the PCE deflater which the Fed focuses on  is running one-sixth, one-seventh.  The expectations are relatively low for  inflation.  The Fed's target is 2 percent.  So, I think she may be overly  focused on that right now.  And to detriment of policy particularly at a  point in time when we know the economic data is going to look a little  lousy between now and your end because of the hurricanes.</p><p>But we don't know how much of that will not be due to the hurricanes.  And  the Fed is going to dismiss it.</p><p>KEENE:  You've been very generous of your time today.  Just quickly here of  the financials, I'm sorry, I didn't bring up.  Are you a big owner of banks  here?</p><p>WARD:  I'm not a big owner of banks which tends to be, you know, more of a  value investors favorite.  I think the banks are offering pretty good  value.  I think there's a capital returns toward there, the benefiting from  the more favorable regulatory environment for sure.</p><p>KEENE:  Yes.</p><p>WARD:  You know, among the big banks, I like J.P. Morgan.  I think it's the  best manage (ph) of the big banks and like Jamie Dimon is a terrific CEO.   The one bank that I own in my domestic fund is First Republic Bank in San  Francisco.  It's really a growth bank.  It has done a terrific job catering  to the very wealthy people in their various pockets mostly on the west  coast, but east coast as well.</p><p>KEENE:  OK.  Very good Howard Ward, thank you so much with Gabelli, greatly  appreciate perspective and particularly the bit we did on general  electorate, look for that out on Bloomberg videos very, very accurate.   He's beginning to acquire shares of fortress planner.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Great  to have you with us here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And let me start with the news highly anticipated more detail and  announcement from the White House from the big six on what tax reform is  going to entail.  Of course, we've just been through another round of  debate over healthcare reform.  How baked into when you -- because right  now is the prospect for their being tax ground (ph), what kind of  difference could it make at this point?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> HOWARD WARD, CIO, GABELLI FUND:  That's a good question, David.  I just  have to believe that now that we have a stock market that priced at 19  times this year's earnings which is the highest multiple going back to the  early 2000 and late '99 period.  I have to believe that a fair amount of a  corporate tax rate discount is built in to evaluations.</p><p> Now, I'm sure we could filter through the market and on a stock by stock  basis find some companies that would be particularly strong beneficiaries  of a corporate tax reduction.  But I think overall, the market is expecting  this and would be quite disappointed if it didn't happen.  I think it may  not happen until next year.  But I think it probably will happen.</p><p> GURA:  What stance to make the greatest difference?  Is it the corporate  reduction or is it a -- if we see it, some sort of discount on repatriating  profits held overseas.  What would make the biggest difference to these  companies?</p><p> WARD:  The corporate tax rate reduction so that somebody who's paying 35  percent today could see their effective rate.  And there are companies like  mine that pay that kind of rate.  We could see their rate fall to 20  percent would be biggest boost.  The repatriation would, I would call that  a lower multiple event.</p><p> But for certain companies, particularly some of the big tech companies like  Apple that have so much money in broad.  If they can bring that back,  that's a certainly a good event for them to put that money to work.  And  then it has implications, what did they do with that money is probably  weren't be Adaptic and M&amp;A, but certainly in technology in some of these  other industries where the money is off shore.</p><p> GURA:  How in opportune at time is it right now to get in to stocks?  It's  something you counsel doing at this point when we see new records in the  equities markets.</p><p> WARD:  Yes.  So I do think that this is the time to be cautious.  You know,  I've been probably saying be cautious for the last year.  And so I may  sound like a \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\".

And we've had a real change in the stance of the Fed from  quantitative easing and lowering rates to the beginning of a quantitative  tightening and raising rates.</p><p> And I think that presents a problem for the market.

For many at the steering wheels of commerce, this year cannot end quickly enough. Bleak is an understatement. Now it's time to strap in with optimism, put the sunlit uplands in the GPS and prepare to motor through 2019 - preferably in a vehicle designed to take the knocks. But, until then: a reminder of a year that didn't go quietly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The collapse of Carillion was a once-in-a-generation crash that earned it a place in the history books alongside Polly Peck, Coloroll and Robert Maxwell's empire almost three decades ago. The second-largest construction company, whose public sector projects ranged from the Royal Liverpool Hospital to the Aberdeen bypass, went into administration in January. Its liabilities were later estimated at almost \u00a37bn. \"The mystery is not that it collapsed,\" said a report by MPs, \"but how it kept going for so long.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The poor cashflow (although it was a late payer of bills), big dividends (it paid out \u00a3333m more than it generated between January 2012 and June 2017) and mushrooming debt were only the most obvious factors in the business's demise.</p><p>When the blame game had dealt with the management and board, fingers were pointed at the auditor KPMG, which signed off the accounts only nine months before Carillion went to the wall. That failure amplified calls to break up the big four accountants - Deloitte, PwC, EY (and KPMG) - which have an auditing stranglehold on all the FTSE 100 companies while at the same time providing consultancy services that generate juicy fees.</p><p>The Financial Reporting Council, which had fined KPMG for its auditing of Ted Baker and Quindell, was itself found unfit for purpose in a review led by Sir John Kingman published this month.</p><p>Not that the other auditors had clean hands. In June, PwC partner Steve Denison received a six-figure fine and 15-year ban for his auditing of BHS (which took two hours of his time) before its knockdown sale to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell. PwC received a \u00a310m fine, reduced to \u00a36.5m.</p><p>Over at Grant Thornton, the second-tier auditor, the partners ganged up on chief executive Sacha Romanovitch and forced her exit. She'd been branded \"a socialist\" by upset colleagues.</p><p>Conviviality was a get-big-quick drinks retailer that included Bargain Booze and Wine Rack shops, as well as the trade suppliers Matthew Clark and Bibendum. Its chief executive, Diana Hunter, kept a printer in the back of her Porsche Cayenne so she could churn out takeover agreements on the move. A missed \u00a330m tax bill revealed between two profit warnings in March saw Hunter removed. Administration and break-up followed.</p><p>A crash was averted at Patisserie Valerie, the chain of cake shops run by Luke Johnson, where a \u00a340m hole was discovered in the accounts. (Grant Thornton was the auditor.) As a columnist in these pages, Johnson has been candid about his own blunders, as well as the less-than-principled activities of others. The finance director was arrested and the chief executive quit. Johnson, with his own and new investor cash, has his head down sorting out the mess.</p><p>Of all the mighty chief executive oaks strewn across the landscape, none had deeper roots than Sir Martin Sorrell, the advertising mogul. Inseparable from WPP since 1986, when he took over the shopping basket maker before building it into the world's biggest marketing agency, Sorrell, 73, was brought down by a scandal that was never proven, with allegations of mistreating his staff (not a first) and supposed visits to Mayfair call-girls. Sorrell, who denied the allegations, resigned as chief executive after 32 years. Then he picked himself up, dusted himself down and started S4 Capital as executive chairman to do what he couldn't with a less-agile WPP.</p><p>The 10-year rule of Paul Polman at the Anglo-Dutch Unilever ended with a whimper after a hubristic attempt to move the consumer brands giant's domicile to Rotterdam foundered in the face of shareholder unrest.</p><p>With his \u00a375m bonus, supercharged by the taxpayers' Help to Buy scheme, Persimmon chief executive Jeff Fairburn had suffered the slings and arrows of outraged investors and politicians and survived. Then, in October, he gave an interview about the FTSE 100 housebuilder's latest brick factory to BBC TV's Look North - and walked off because he was asked about his bonus. \"That's really unfortunate actually that you've done that,\" said Fairburn, turning the TV clip into social media gold. It was too much for the board and Fairburn stepped down.</p><p>Aviva said that after six years as chief executive, Mark Wilson would leave next April, having had to back down on an attempt to cancel preference shares that infuriated retail and institutional investors alike, and having taken a non-executive role at BlackRock, a rival to Aviva Global Investors.</p><p>After an accounting scandal in Italy and a share price plunge, Gavin Patterson had to announce his exit from BT, to be replaced by Philip Jansen, formerly of Worldpay. In September, Stephen Kelly parted company with Sage, the FTSE 100 software supplier, after a big profit warning in April.</p><p>At Royal Mail, chairman Peter Long walked the plank after a series of mis-steps: a \u00a3914,000 golden goodbye for chief executive Dame Moya Greene; a golden hello of \u00a35.8m to her successor Rico Back, who already worked for the postal service; and a row over his other commitment at Countrywide.</p><p>Mike Lynch, founder of Autonomy, was charged last month with fraud by American prosecutors over the software developer's $11bn (\u00a37.4bn at the time) sale to Hewlett-Packard. His chief financial officer Sushovan Hussain was found guilty of fraud in June.</p><p>In the world of mergers and acquisitions, Melrose won its hard-fought battle for GKN in March. Despite opposition from MPs and unions, Melrose's hostile \u00a37.9bn cash-and-shares bid convinced investors by a narrow margin to cede ownership of the aerospace and automotive parts maker. The FTSE 100 drugs giant Shire was swallowed this month by Japan's Takeda for \u00a346bn while broadcaster Sky was swept off its feet by American cable colossus Comcast in a \u00a330bn deal that overwhelmed rival Walt Disney.</p><p>A plague of locusts might have appeared on the high street this year and it would have been as nothing compared with the turmoil caused by the internet, high business rates and expensive leases. While Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, was singing \"We're in the Money\" to celebrate his intended \u00a37.3bn takeover of Asda (now subject to review), everyone else was hurting.</p><p>After the failures of Toys R Us and Maplin, House of Fraser slid into administration in August and was picked up by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley, who also grabbed Evans Cycles. The Newcastle United owner trumpeted that he was going to create a \"Harrods of the high street\" - the suspicion being that he sees a chance to merge it with the ailing Debenhams. Having admitted to MPs that the internet was killing the high street, it seemed a somewhat impractical vision.</p><p>And banks still had their moments. A catastrophic IT upgrade in April at TSB that caused havoc to millions of customers claimed the job of Paul Pester, who saw it through listing and into the arms of Spain's Banco Sabadell in 2015. Debbie Crosbie from CYBG replaced him. Jes Staley, chief executive at Barclays, was fined more than \u00a31.1m by UK regulators for his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. In New York, Barclays was fined $15m for failures of governance in the case.</p><p>The Financial Conduct Authority said in July that Royal Bank of Scotland would face no action over its local restructuring group that had been accused of pushing business owners into bankruptcy before grabbing their assets. But Lloyds Banking Group proved unable to shake off the \u00a3245m HBOS Reading scandal, in which small businesses were defrauded.</p><p>The Serious Fraud Office suffered two high-profile court reverses: the failure to convict two Tesco executives over a \u00a3250m gap in accounts, and the High Court's dismissal of its prosecution of Barclays over its 2008 fundraising from the Qataris.</p><p>If there wasn't enough scandal about corporate behaviour, a light was shone on the unedifying behaviour of bosses. The Presidents Club, a charity event where some attendees allegedly groped the mini-skirted waitresses, held its last dinner in January after a Financial Times reporter exposed its vices. A few weeks ago, this newspaper reported that staff at the Ted Baker fashion chain had objected to founder and chief executive Ray Kelvin's hugs, among other things. Sandwiched between those two, Topshop boss Sir Philip Green was outed as the instigator of numerous non-disclosure agreements with staff upset by his treatment of them.</p><p>One phrase summed up the state of political play in a year of Brexit uncertainty: Boris Johnson's reported \"F*** business\" may have been an ill-judged ejaculation, but it seemed to be taken up as a mantra by government and opposition alike. Today is B-Day minus 89. As if you didn't know.</p><p>                   Big Tech's year of living dangerously                   </p><p>This was the year where it all changed for Silicon Valley - when Big Tech was revealed not only as one of the powerful forces in the modern world, but a malign one, </p><p>                   writes Danny Fortson in San Francisco                   </p><p>. It was the year of Cambridge Analytica. It was the year a robotic Mark Zuckerberg fended off questions in Congress. It was the year Google sent an empty chair to the Capitol. It was the year that a wave of research linked use of social media with teenage suicide and depression. It was the year that America indicted Russian trolls who sought to swing the 2016 election using Facebook. It was the year that the United Nations accused the social network of abetting genocide in Myanmar. Now the regulators are coming. If 2018 was an awakening, in 2019 begins the reckoning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-50443212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2Y-YV41-JCJY-G4P4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1639\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 30, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002MJ2</classCode><className>KPMG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC000DFKW</classCode><className>PATISSERIE HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002N03</classCode><className>GRANT THORNTON INTERNATIONAL LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

New Zealand also rolled out a Covid-19 tracer app which involved scanning QR codes when visiting a venue so that people\u2019s movement could be tracked.\u00a0</p><p>By all accounts, this system worked well. The rules were crystal clear for both venue owners and their customers, and New Zealand was able to eradicate Covid-19 cases in the country by implementing this kind of quick, clear, and strict instruction.\u00a0</p><p>However, it was a laborious task for some venue owners and there were also examples of privacy violations.\u00a0</p><p>A New Zealand Subway customer was harassed online by a now-former employee who took the customers\u2019 details in writing. This kind of data privacy abuse is why many consumers were concerned about having to hand over contact information. It is food for thought for UK venues too, who will want to avoid the same kind of scenario.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Similar rules have been implemented elsewhere too including Germany and Switzerland \u2013 though the Swiss subsequently changed the rules to put the onus on customers to keep track of who they meet and where. This is less work for venue owners, but it is likely to be far less reliable, accurate and effective than New Zealand\u2019s measures \u2013 but only time will tell.</p><p>Germany decided to keep the responsibility with venue owners. Berlin\u2019s senate \u201cstrongly advises\u201d that restaurants take down customer contact details and keep them on file for four weeks. The German population is extremely sensitive to data privacy and security violations, which is likely why it opted against a centralised Government data collection process, but this was not the case in all countries.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Centralised track and trace</p><p>To avoid giving venue owners personal data directly, Australia opted for a centralised government track and trace app.\u00a0</p><p>Businesses were sent their venue-specific posters printed with QR codes after signing up on a digital portal. Customers were obliged to \u201cscan themselves in\u201d to a location as part of the tracing process.</p><p>The benefit to venue owners is clear, but these measures may not work well in countries that have low trust in the Government. There\u2019s also a risk that a huge trove of personal data becomes available to cyber criminals in the case of a data breach \u2013 which coincidentally the Australian Government experienced earlier this month.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In France, the government is doing something unique. It has consulted with tech giants Apple and Google about weakening their existing privacy policies in order to make a contact tracing program more tenable.\u00a0</p><p>There are several complexities and challenges when it comes to integrating data across various devices, and with public health data. There is also the issue of whether we should trust \u2018big tech\u2019 given its track record on privacy. The concern is that this could have negative implications further down the line and set a precedent for weaker privacy standards.</p><p>The right tech and processes for UK venues</p><p>As evidenced by the approaches in other countries, contact tracing and data collection are issues of great complexity \u2013 in terms of technical requirements, consumer privacy concerns and real-world practicalities.\u00a0</p><p>In the face of wishy-washy Government advice, the onus is on UK venues to act responsibly.\u00a0</p><p>If they can demonstrate that they take the issue seriously, venues will also show they are committed to keeping people safe in their venue.

However, it\u2019s important that all guests are registered, not just the person buying the round.\u00a0</p><p>Likewise, it has proved difficult to get customers to download these apps in the past, so venues will need to prompt people to do so.\u00a0</p><p>As for the small minority of people without a smartphone, their contact details can be recorded separately.\u00a0</p><p>Government apps\u200b\u00a0\u2013 waiting on the UK Government to release its own app is not an option for pubs opening in July.

New Zealand also rolled out a Covid-19 tracer app which involved scanning QR codes when visiting a venue so that people s movement could be tracked.\u00a0</p><p>By all accounts, this system worked well. The rules were crystal clear for both venue owners and their customers, and New Zealand was able to eradicate Covid-19 cases in the country by implementing this kind of quick, clear, and strict instruction.\u00a0</p><p>However, it was a laborious task for some venue owners and there were also examples of privacy violations.\u00a0</p><p>A New Zealand Subway customer was harassed online by a now-former employee who took the customers  details in writing. This kind of data privacy abuse is why many consumers were concerned about having to hand over contact information. It is food for thought for UK venues too, who will want to avoid the same kind of scenario.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Similar rules have been implemented elsewhere too including Germany and Switzerland   though the Swiss subsequently changed the rules to put the onus on customers to keep track of who they meet and where. This is less work for venue owners, but it is likely to be far less reliable, accurate and effective than New Zealand s measures   but only time will tell.</p><p>Germany decided to keep the responsibility with venue owners. Berlin s senate  strongly advises  that restaurants take down customer contact details and keep them on file for four weeks. The German population is extremely sensitive to data privacy and security violations, which is likely why it opted against a centralised Government data collection process, but this was not the case in all countries.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Centralised track and trace</p><p>To avoid giving venue owners personal data directly, Australia opted for a centralised government track and trace app.\u00a0</p><p>Businesses were sent their venue-specific posters printed with QR codes after signing up on a digital portal. Customers were obliged to  scan themselves in  to a location as part of the tracing process.</p><p>The benefit to venue owners is clear, but these measures may not work well in countries that have low trust in the Government. There s also a risk that a huge trove of personal data becomes available to cyber criminals in the case of a data breach   which coincidentally the Australian Government experienced earlier this month.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In France, the government is doing something unique. It has consulted with tech giants Apple and Google about weakening their existing privacy policies in order to make a contact tracing program more tenable.\u00a0</p><p>There are several complexities and challenges when it comes to integrating data across various devices, and with public health data. There is also the issue of whether we should trust  big tech  given its track record on privacy. The concern is that this could have negative implications further down the line and set a precedent for weaker privacy standards.</p><p>The right tech and processes for UK venues</p><p>As evidenced by the approaches in other countries, contact tracing and data collection are issues of great complexity   in terms of technical requirements, consumer privacy concerns and real-world practicalities.\u00a0</p><p>In the face of wishy-washy Government advice, the onus is on UK venues to act responsibly.\u00a0</p><p>If they can demonstrate that they take the issue seriously, venues will also show they are committed to keeping people safe in their venue. In doing so, they may engender trust and loyalty that will last far longer than the pandemic.</p><p>From high-end tech to old-fashioned pen and paper, some options for pubs include:</p><p>Pen and paper printed log \u00a0  physical ledgers are cheap, fast and easy to implement, but they are probably the worst option available to pub owners.\u00a0</p><p>They are unsafe, insecure and susceptible to misuse - as demonstrated by the New Zealand Subway story.\u00a0</p><p>If done by a staff member, it s an extra job on their list, if done by customers it defeats the purpose of social distancing and minimising contact.\u00a0</p><p>A digital spreadsheet\u00a0 - slightly more secure and definitely more sustainable.\u00a0</p><p>However, this is still another job for already busy staff, and even though a touchscreen can be cleaned, the potential for contamination on a heavily used surface is high.\u00a0</p><p>Data protection is still questionable in the eyes of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>Smartphone registration \u00a0  Having customers sign in via their smartphone makes logical sense, it is contactless and most people will be carrying one anyhow.\u00a0</p><p>The pubs that go down this route need to ensure that they are recording this data securely, and that the process is as simple as possible, whether via a QR code or as people register for the guest WiFi.\u00a0</p><p>Creating a custom app or website portal will be popular for venues wanting to encourage customers to pay for food and drinks at their table versus crowding at the bar. However, it s important that all guests are registered, not just the person buying the round.\u00a0</p><p>Likewise, it has proved difficult to get customers to download these apps in the past, so venues will need to prompt people to do so.\u00a0</p><p>As for the small minority of people without a smartphone, their contact details can be recorded separately.\u00a0</p><p>Government apps \u00a0  waiting on the UK Government to release its own app is not an option for pubs opening in July. Even after that, there s no guarantee people will download it.\u00a0</p><p>Only 40% of people in Australia downloaded their Covid app, but universal coverage is essential for keeping people safe.</p><p>Booking systems \u00a0  It is possible that third parties such as JustEat, TripAdvisor, or Booking.com will enter the market to offer pubs a quick and easy way of registering visitors and recording their details when they make a reservation.\u00a0</p><p>The disadvantage of this, however, is that these brands maintain the relationship with the customer, rather than the venue. We ve seen with the restaurant industry that these services can be a bit of a double-edged sword.</p><p>With so many options available, it s important that pubs collect data in a manner that makes customers feel safe, with minimal disruption to familiar experiences.\u00a0</p><p>These are strange times and many people will come back to the pub with uncertainty or hesitation.

But AI is more than just a machine with human-level intelligence scientists hope they could one day create. It is a set of algorithms and technologies that is already powering many tasks in everyday life.

Chatbots that converse with you in Yahoo, Facebook and other sites use AI. Alibaba harnesses deep learning to find a handbag matching the one in the photo you uploaded to its shopping site. Digital assistants like Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant use AI to provide information or execute tasks. The advancements continue. Computers are now able to generate an image that 40% of people could mistake for a photographed face, according to Lukasz Kaiser, senior research scientist at Google Brain, who spoke at the recent AI Frontiers conference in Silicon Valley. Previously, computers could only fool about a tenth of the people. 'We're very close to generating photos that look like real faces.' AI can also take search queries and reference web pages to create an article, such as a person's biography, based on everything about him or her found on the internet, he said. More companies are jumping into AI development. Frank Chen, a partner at top venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said many of the roughly 1,500 startups his firm sees annually began turning to AI two years ago. 'Now, 60% to 70% of the companies we see self-identify as an AI startup,' he said at the conference. Chen predicted that AI will become as pervasive in business as databases did because of its usefulness. Databases are 'so generally useful, they got assigned to all the applications. AI is exactly the same,' he added. 'AI is going to get into everything.' '[Databases are] so generally useful, they got assigned to all the applications. AI is exactly the same.'-Frank Chen Chen added that investors will soon stop looking specifically for AI startups, and instead assume that all startups are using AI in some form. It's the same trajectory that mobile technology and cloud computing followed. In 2009, being a cloud native was 'new and different,' and startups also began distancing themselves from desktops to identify as mobile-first. 'Now, if we see a startup that's not cloud native and not mobile-first, we ask, 'What's going on with you?' AI is going through the same exact thing,' he said. AI Startups Startups deploying AI can do everything from using drones for medical deliveries to helping lawyers prepare for court. Chen said his firm has invested in Zipline[1], an AI startup that uses drones to deliver blood to remote places such as western Rwanda. The service is critical to locations that are hard to access by land. 'By the time a truck can get there, it may be too late,' he said. Medical personnel in the field use an app to order blood by type. Half an hour later, a drone drops it out of the sky. The drone has a 75-kilometer range and accuracy of five feet. Chen said Zipline is making up to 500 delivers a day and is looking to expand. Everlaw[2] helps lawyers prepare for trials. The first step in any trial is the gathering of evidence. The startup uses AI to do things like read documents to find ones helpful to the lawyer's case and identify those that need to be sent to the opposition to avoid a mistrial. 'This categorizes documents automatically so you don't miss documents that are important,' Chen said. Naturali[3] is a China-based firm that uses AI and speech recognition to speed up the access and usage of apps. For example, to order an Uber ride, you have to unlock your phone, click on the Uber app, type in the destination, choose the type of ride and then book it. 'Wouldn't it be nice if you can just tell your phone \u2014 'Uber ride Crowne Plaza San Francisco' \u2014 and then the Uber app just gives you the car?' said Dekang Lin, Naturali's co-founder and chief technology officer. 'We upgrade apps with a speech interface to translate speech into clicks and swipes.' Startups deploying AI can do everything from using drones for medical deliveries to helping lawyers prepare for court. Voicera[4] aims to make meetings more productive. It created Eva, a digital personal assistant for the workplace. Omar Tawakol, founder and CEO of the startup, said the most used forms of business collaboration are instant messaging and email. But during meetings, employees are disconnected from this workflow and may forget to do follow-ups. Moreover, 'the vast majority of the conversations are lost in the ether,' he said. Eva will take notes, process the meeting and send a summary of it to participants. It also could be instructed to do action items, such as send a copy of a presentation to everyone in the meeting. Shield AI[5] is a startup that developed drones to fly through combat or crisis situations. For example, the drones can map a building in real time to construct 3D maps and identify the people inside. 'Today, when we're in hostile territory, we send young people with guns inside buildings,' Chen said. C3 IoT[6] helps companies solve business problems by leveraging four big tech trends: big data, cloud computing, AI and machine learning as well as the Internet of Things. For example, it helped one Italian utility detect fraud using smart meters. About 3% of electricity in that country is stolen, said Zico Kolter, chief data scientist. Some people even put car cables around the electricity meter to siphon it off. 'We predict the probably of fraud and probability of recovering energy,' he said. In another case, the startup monitored oil and gas wells to see which are more likely to fail and cause environmental issues. 'Wouldn't it be nice if you can just tell your phone \u2014 'Uber ride Crowne Plaza San Francisco' \u2014 and then the Uber app just gives you the car?' \u2014 Dekang Lin BioAge Labs[7] is a life extension startup that uses machine learning to help people live longer. 'They look for small molecules in your blood stream that are predictive of mortality,' said Chen, whose firm has invested in the company. 'What they've done through machine learning is identify molecules to focus on for drug discovery that might help us extend life.' Airware[8] is a drone analytics startup serving industries such as mining. For example, mine owners need to follow many safety regulations and one rule is to use rocks as road markers to guide vehicles. The rule is that these rocks need to be twice as high as the tallest wheel of the vehicle. Mine owners usually send people out to measure the height of the rocks. Airware simplifies the process by using drones to analyze imagery and identify rocks that are too short. It can also analyze a road's steepness and recommend that drivers take another route to save on fuel.
