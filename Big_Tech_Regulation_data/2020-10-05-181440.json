That tracks with reports from the past few months. In late July, Bloomberg noted that Nvidia was eyeing Arm , while also reporting that Apple \u2014 despite a well-publicised shift to Arm-based silicon \u2014 wasn\u2019t interested . SoftBank, the Japanese telecom company that bought Arm for $US31 ($43) billion in 2016, has been pummelled by the pandemic, and selling Arm is believed to be a bid to raise some moolah to offset that. As part of the deal, Nvidia is forking over $US21.5 ($30) billion in stock, and $US12 ($16) billion in cash, of which $US2 ($3) billion will be handed over at signing.              This is the Ray Tracing We\u2019ve Been Waiting For    Today, Nvidia showed us the true promise and vision of ray tracing \u2014 making virtual environments look as real as possible based on how light is cast and reflected off surfaces and objects. It\u2019s not a new concept. Animation studios like Pixar have been working with ray traced effects for...   Read more        That said, Arm\u2019s ubiquity has meant its sale is tricky from an anti-trust front. SoftBank buying Arm in 2016 flew under the radar in large part because the company itself doesn\u2019t make its own devices or sell chips. Nearly every other company that would\u2019ve been interested in buying Arm would\u2019ve raised huge regulatory red flags.   As Ars Technica points out, Arm itself doesn\u2019t produce its own chips \u2014 it licenses its technology to other companies based on its Arm CPU architecture. Apple, Intel, Samsung, Qualcomm, and Huawei are all examples of companies that licence from Arm. That means it\u2019s a real no-no for Qualcomm, the chipmaker that\u2019s already in the majority of Android smartphones, as it would practically mean total domination of the market. Likewise, Google wouldn\u2019t be in the running as it\u2019s already under intense anti-trust scrutiny \u2014 buying Arm would only make it worse when you factor in Google\u2019s dominance due to the Android operating system. Apple might\u2019ve made some sense on account of all the hullabaloo that is Apple Silicon, and SoftBank did hold preliminary talks with the Cupertino tech giant, but again, with so many of its rivals as Arm licensees, it would\u2019ve been a hard sell.   Nvidia, however, is the least controversial processor company that could buy Arm. While it also licenses Arm technology, Nvidia\u2019s main schtick is GPUs. There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t really hear about Nvidia with regard to smartphones. In fact, the only real outside hardware using its mobile chipset Tegra is the Nintendo Switch and the Magic Leap headset, which let\u2019s be real, doesn\u2019t really count as a win. That said, should the deal go through, Nvidia buying Arm could mean a lot of major improvements to the Tegra chipset and could theoretically, be a good thing for Nintendo down the line.   This deal is huge and will have a huge ripple effect on the industry. Not only will Nvidia, practically overnight, gain a huge foothold in the smartphone market, it\u2019ll also position it as a major player in the riveting world of\u2026 data centres. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been quoted by both Bloomberg and the New York Times as stating a major priority will be expanding Arm chips for networking and cloud computing \u2014 an area that Intel has a 90% share in.   But the Nvidia-Arm deal is not necessarily a foregone conclusion \u2014 now is not exactly a boom time for big tech mergers. Appeasing regulators could be a big reason why in its announcement, Nvidia committed to keeping Arm based in the UK and explicitly stating it is committed to keeping Arm\u2019s \u201copen-licensing model while maintaining the global customer neutrality that has been foundational to its success.\u201d We\u2019ll have to see over the next 18 months whether regulators take Nvidia\u2019s assurances at face value.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43073353092</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V7-M271-F07F-83FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"711\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gizmodo Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 14, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York Times Co</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NYT</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

That's about all you can say to what could prove to be one of the biggest semiconductor purchases in the multi-decade history of the chip business. The amazing irony is that this $40 billion dollar deal doesn't involve any chips at all. The news that was announced[1] on what proved to be a rather eventful Sunday evening is that GPU giant and AI leader Nvidia is planning to acquire the IP assets and business of Cambridge, UK-based Arm from Softbank. </p><p>Though few people truly understand or appreciate what Arm does or the influence it has, the simple fact is that it arguably owns one of the pre-eminent positions in the tech world. Put simply, almost every single smartphone currently being used or being sold in the world uses an Arm-based CPU: Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, and MediaTek among others all license the CPU architectures -- and in some cases GPU, AI co-processors and other components -- that Arm's engineers and designers create. Smartphone makers, in turn, use those designs to create chips that are then integrated into the devices we use.Must read: How ARM Came to Dominate the Mobile Market[2]Apple and a few others have what's called an architectural license that allows them to take the basic design of the CPU and then customize around it.Many others, including Qualcomm, take the design as it is and then add other components of either their own or Arm's design in order to build, for instance, Qualcomm's very popular Snapdragon line of SoCs (system on chips). In other words, it's Arm that's arguably been driving the incredible growth and sophistication of smartphone hardware and architecture for roughly the past 15 years or so. The company's influence, however, extends way beyond smartphones. Most recently, Arm has also been making significant inroads in the data center business with its Neo brand of server-focused IP. Oh, and there is the fact that Apple just announced[3] that it was going to transition the Mac off of x86-based CPU architectures from the likes of Intel and move entirely to its own custom CPUs[4] based on\u2014you guessed it\u2014Arm-based CPU architectures.Toss in the fledgling but growing Windows on Arm-based PC business\u2014as exemplified by Microsoft's Surface ProX[5]\u2014along with a huge, but little recognized presence in IoT devices[6], and you can see that, to some degree or another, Arm's influence extends[7] to just about every person on the planet.As a result, it's not surprising to see Nvidia's interest in Arm. Indeed, rumors started[8] flying several months ago that Nvidia could be a potential purchaser of Arm, but many\u2014myself included\u2014brushed it off as unrealistic. Yet, here we are. My concerns, as well as those of many other industry observers, are that it would be very challenging for a company with a defined position within the industry to maintain the Switzerland-like neutrality that Arm has been able to offer.When Softbank purchased[9] Arm about 4 years ago for nearly $32 billion, there were even a few concerns raised then\u2014because of the incredibly influential role that Arm plays\u2014but those concerns were quickly tossed aside when people realized Softbank didn't have any vested interests in specific platforms or tech hardware companies.That's not the case for Nvidia, however, and that's why a number of questions are being raised about the challenges expected to come from Nvidia's competitors, and even non-competing Arm customers, on the regulatory front. Nvidia has said that the purchase process could extend to as long as 18 months because of the approvals that would need to occur in multiple geographies across the world.If you look at the business that each company is currently in, however, there really isn't much overlap. Nvidia has no presence in the smartphone market and, despite multiple efforts in the past, no major CPU architecture of any kind. In fact, ironically, Nvidia's actually an Arm licensee. Arm does have GPU and NPU (neural processing unit\u2014used for AI acceleration) IP and chip designs, and even some that theoretically compete with Nvidia in the data center market. Arm's current impact in those areas is tiny, however, and that market is evolving at an extremely fast pace. Most importantly, Nvidia sells actual chips, and Arm sells chip IP designs. Those are very different and non-overlapping business models. The level of power and influence this combination could create is likely to give some big tech companies pause\u2014especially those who compete directly with Nvidia (notably Intel and AMD) and even those who have been loyal Arm licensees\u2014but may have potential issues with Nvidia (notably Apple and Qualcomm)The biggest issues will likely come down to the competitive threats and strategic concerns that the combination of Nvidia and Arm will create. The truth is, this acquisition could be a brilliant move for Nvidia, because it would extend the company's level of influence and exposure to many areas of the tech market that it has never been able to reach. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang specifically called out how the combination would give the company the ability to extend its AI efforts to a significantly broader range of devices. This is important to consider because, while most people think of Nvidia primarily as a GPU chip maker, Huang sees the company as having a much wider purview\u2014that it is really more of an AI enabling company, which happens to make chips that in turn make AI faster and more efficient to do. In that light, the Arm acquisition makes complete sense. Plus, it allows the company to finally scratch the CPU itch that it's had (and Huang) for a very long time.The level of power and influence this combination could create is likely to give some big tech companies pause\u2014especially those who compete directly with Nvidia (notably Intel[10] and AMD[11]) and even those who have been loyal Arm licensees\u2014but may have potential issues with Nvidia (notably Apple[12] and Qualcomm[13]). While I really don't think Nvidia's goal was to go after Intel\u2014after all, the companies have been strong partners for years\u2014there's no doubt that this deal could have a big impact long-term on Intel's business in several sectors. As a result, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to see Intel oppose the proposed sale. Largest tech deals in historyIn Apple's case, given that it just announced a long-term switch to Arm-based CPUs for the Mac, but has not been using Nvidia GPUs for many years, it will be interesting to see if Apple shows any signs of backtracking on its strategic decision. I doubt it\u2014especially because Apple heavily customizes its Arm-based A line of CPUs for iPhones and iPads and will likely do the same for its Mac-specific[14] Arm-based chips\u2014but it will certainly be interesting to watch.Geopolitically, the move could be a big challenge for an already struggling China semiconductor market. At the same time, Arm had already started limiting its work with Huawei's HiSilicon semiconductor branch in the middle of last year, so the fact that Arm could be owned by a US company wouldn't seem to make a big change (though, politically these days, anything could happen). Frankly, a bigger issue could be the UK itself. Arm is considered the crown jewel of the UK tech industry, so its government is very sensitive to the appearance of selling out to other countries. Given that Arm already sold to Japan-based Softbank in 2016, however, as well as Nvidia's smart and shrewd move to build a significant AI research center in Cambridge, those concerns likely won't last long.From a technology perspective, there are a few other interesting issues to consider. First, many have argued that this purchase could push Arm licensees toward RISC-V, an open source IP chip architecture that many see as a potential challenger to Arm. The truth is, however, most of RISC-V's success has been at the low-power microcontroller end of Arm's business, and it really does not pose any significant threat to the higher-power Arm designs used for smartphones, PCs, and servers. Over time, the threat could grow, but it's likely a long way off.There are many very interesting new developments, in areas like automotive, smart home, robotics, industrial and others, that could emerge from the combined mind-power and technical abilities of an Nvidia-Arm combination.Another interesting challenge to consider would be the potential integration of technologies between the two companies. Specifically, Arm has made its name creating CPU (and GPU) designs that are incredibly power efficient and perform very well in battery-powered or other power constrained environments. Nvidia's GPUs, on the other hand, well, let's just say aren't generally known as power-sippers. In fact, it's not unusual for them to require significantly more power than other elements of a PC or server.Of course, over time, it would be great to see Arm's proficiency in power conservation transferred over to GPU designs, just as it would be great to see Nvidia's prowess in graphics and AI acceleration added to Arm's existing offerings. In fact, it is these types of promises that make this potential combination appealing on many levels. There are many very interesting new developments, in areas like automotive, smart home, robotics, industrial and others, that could emerge from the combined mind-power and technical abilities of an Nvidia-Arm combination.At the same time, there is a very real risk to the long-term trust-based business model that Arm has been able to create, if Nvidia starts to intervene too much. Nvidia clearly seems to understand these issues and has vowed to maintain Arm as an independent, UK-based company that will continue to honor its unique IP-based business model. If it doesn't, Arm could lose the huge range of licensing customers it now has, causing serious damage to Arm's overall business.Ultimately, it's going to be a question of balance, trust, and intelligent leveraging of the assets that each company can bring to the table. No doubt, there will be serious questions from both customers and competitors\u2014as there should be in a potential merger of this importance. Nevertheless, the potential new upsides and opportunities this merger could create, not just for the combined entity but for the tech industry as a whole, seem too compelling to pass up. It might not be an easy or necessarily perfectly straight path ahead, but it sure seems like a big step forward into an exciting future.Bob O'Donnell is the founder and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, LLC[15] a technology consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

He unveiled the company's announcements at a press event on Sunday at the big tech trade show in Las Vegas. They included the 9-billion transistor Xavier artificial intelligence chip[2], the beta launch of GeForce Now[3]\u00a0cloud gaming on Windows, and support for large format displays known as BGFD[4]. Then he returned for a Q...ith the press on Thursday, where he went into an unscripted monologue on what the company is doing in both artificial intelligence and gaming. When he finally stopped talking, the press got a chance to ask him some questions. </p><p>Here's an edited transcript of our interview. I've also included three videos of the entire talk, if you prefer to watch it on video. Above: Jensen Huang started out talking about gaming advances like the BFGD. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiJensen Huang: CES, as you guys know, has changed a lot over the years. It started out being about 'consumer electronics.' About seven years ago or so, we invited Audi to CES for the first time. At the time, no German companies had ever come to CES. They said, 'But this is consumer electronics.' I told them, 'The car is the world's largest consumer electronics.' Today it's a mechanical device with these amazing engines and leather seats and industrial design, but in the future, the car will be packed with computing technology. It's going to be packed with software. It's going to be the ultimate consumer electronics device. I wish all of you guys had seen it, but it was plastered\u2014Audi had come to CES for the first time, Vegas for the first time. Their executives came to the Vegas for the first time. What they saw and they feedback they got was incredible. It was at exactly the right time, I think. Since then, this has become practically an automotive show. The simplicity of it is that consumer electronics and the fusing of computing technology into almost everything we own\u2014that particular trend is never going to stop. CES is getting larger and larger simply because computing technology is infusing into our lives more and more. [embedded content] Here at CES we announced several things this week. I had a keynote. It was so packed with stuff that we couldn't even include all our important gaming news. I'm going to start with gaming first. As you know, GeForce is the world's largest game platform. It has 200 million active users, active gamers. It's the number one gaming platform in a lot of different countries, from China to Russia to southeast Asia. It's because GeForce, as you know, works incredibly well. Every game works great on it. The PC is an open, evolving, vibrant platform. It just gets better every day. It doesn't get better every five years. It gets better every single day. When technology is moving the way it is, it stands to reason that a platform that can evolve every day, over the course of time, would have a dramatic lead over other platforms. Anything that has to take a giant step every five years. That's why GeForce today gives you the best possible gaming experience, if that's what you like. [embedded content] It's also an open platform for different styles of play. A PC can support every single input and output peripheral. It doesn't matter what it is. Whether it's a game pad or a keyboard or a mouse or whatever it is, it's able. It has such rich I/O. Because of where it sits, on your desk, you can enjoy it in any possible way. As a result of all those different types of I/O and different ways to engage the computer, there are lots of styles of play. You can use it for first-person shooters, for esports, for social gaming. You can share your winning moments, create art, broadcast. The number of different ways you can enjoy games on a PC, the styles of games and how you can enjoy them, continues to evolve. Now we know that gaming is not only a great game, but a great sport. It's the largest sport, because it can be any sport. It can be a football game one day and a survivor game another day. PUBG, the latest game this last year, an incredible concept. When you see a great idea, you see it and you think, 'Why didn't I think of that?' It's so obvious. PUBG is one of those great game ideas. [embedded content] Not only would it be a great game to play, it's also - just like Survivor or the Hunger Games - it's a great game to watch. The number of people watching PUBG is obviously very high. All of a sudden a brand new genre came into gaming, and it did that on PC. We announced several things. 10 new desktop PCs were created, of all different sizes and shapes, based around GeForce. Three new Max Q notebooks. We took energy efficiency and performance engineering to the extreme with Max Q. From architecture to chip design to system design, voltage, power regulation design, thermal design, software design, we took something that was already energy efficient and squeezed it into a thin notebook. Max Q notebooks are thrilling to look at. Imagine a computer that's four times the performance of a Macbook Pro, almost twice the performance of the highest-end game console. It fits on your hand like this, in a 20mm notebook that weighs only five pounds. It's crazy. We took our engineering skills to the limit and we delivered Max Q. Then we said, 'What else can we do to expand the reach of gaming and take the experience to a new level?' We always thought it would be great if we could take PC gaming, which is already amazing, and put it on the one display that we always wished it would be on: the largest display in your house. What would you call the largest display in your house? It's the BFG display. So we called it BFGD[5], Big Format Gaming Display. [laughs]\u00a0That's what it stands for. It never gets old.

Nvidia agreed to a $40 billion purchase agreement for Arm with its parent company \u2014 Softbank Group Corp (OTC: SFTBY[2]) \u2014 but said the deal would need the approval of authorities in the U.S., the U.K., the E.U., and China. According to Sebastian Hou, the Managing Director and Head of Technology Research at CLSA, the'biggest challenge' for Nvidia and SoftBank would be potentialsanction from Chinese regulators. China would want to avoid the \"nightmare\" ofan Americancompany owning Arm, as that would open a window for the U.S.government to restrict its access to the crucial technology. \"Given the U.S.-China tensions and US suppression on a range of Chinese technology enterprises, if Arm falls into U.S. hands, Chinese technology companies would certainly be placed at a big disadvantage in the market,\" Chinese state-owned newspaper Global Times wrote.[3] Why It Matters:In April 2018 Arm entered into a joint venture with a consortium of Chinese companies which included the state-backed China Investment Corporation and the Silk Road fund, according to South China Morning Post[4]. A majority stake is collectively held by the Chinese entities, whereas Arm holds 49% in the joint venture. The British chip designer's business model relies on licensing its technology to other technology companies. Reportedly, over 180 billion chips using Arm's technology have been shipped worldwide and almost all the smartphones use this technology. A change in ownership of Arm Holdings could have an overall impact on the semiconductor industry, especially due to the tensions between the two leading economies in the world. Arm co-founderHermann Hauser last weektermed[5]the company's acquisition as a 'disaster' for Europe. Price Movement: After a 1.85% gain during trading hours, Nvidia stock gained an additional 1.03% in the extended trading hours to close at $499.  2020 Benzinga.com.

Though that practice -- which security experts said left  users vulnerable to identity theft -- ended in May 2016, Facebook  continued to gain access to the email address books of at least 1.5  million new users.</p><p> Users were not notified that their contact lists were being  harvested at the time. Facebook shuttered the contact list  collection mechanism shortly after the issue was discovered by the  press.</p><p>Facebook said it was in touch with the attorney general's  office and was responding to questions about the issue.</p><p> The attorney general's investigation will focus on how the  practice came about, and whether or not the email contact  collection spread to hundreds of millions more people across the  social network, according to the two people. Nearly 2.4 billion  people use Facebook each month, with 1.56 billion people visiting  the site at least once every day.</p><p> The investigation comes on the heels of a difficult year for  the social networking giant, which has been rocked by a series of  scandals regarding how it handles user data and privacy. In March  2018, The New York Times reported how a third-party political firm,  Cambridge Analytica, harvested and exploited the personal  information of millions of Facebook users.</p><p> Last fall, Facebook announced it had fallen victim to the  largest data breach in the company's 15-year history, exposing the  accounts of tens of millions of its users. And more recently,  Facebook admitted it had stored the passwords of hundreds of  millions of its users in \"plaintext,\" a security practice frowned  upon by industry experts.</p><p> The attorney general's action is the latest in a string of such  moves by lawmakers and regulators, many of which have set their  sights on Big Tech over the past two years. In December, the  attorney general of the District of Columbia sued Facebook for its  role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal and for its failure to  protect the privacy of its users.</p><p> And Wednesday, Facebook announced it expected to pay a fine of  up to $5 billion to the Federal Trade Commission for its privacy  violations, the biggest penalty ever imposed by the agency on a  technology company. It was the latest sign that Washington, after  years of ignoring the growing power of Silicon Valley, is taking  tech regulation more seriously.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20190426Ar00501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W04-9RH1-DXVP-V07H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

If she and Trump's DOJ can find common cause investigating Big Tech's power, that would be one more sign of the issue's bipartisan appeal.Details: James is expected to meet with Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Associate Attorney General for antitrust Makan Delrahim, the person familiar with the plans said. A bipartisan group of state attorneys general is also expected to join the meeting, the person said. </p><p>Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson were part of the group of state officials in Washington for the meeting, according to their offices.States investigating Google for anticompetitive practices \u2014 including Texas and New York \u2014 sent representatives to meet with top DOJ officials in July to discuss tech antitrust issues.The Justice Department and FTC split jurisdiction over major tech companies for competition concerns earlier this year, with the FTC taking up an antitrust investigation into Facebook. But, as Bloomberg reported[1], Barr prodded his agency to begin its own Facebook inquiry, prompting concerns[2] from both FTC chairman Joe Simons and[3] Republican Sen. Mike Lee about overlapping investigations.The state attorneys general also discussed the Facebook investigation at the FTC today, according to a spokesperson for the New York AG's office. The states met with FTC chairman Joe Simons, some of the commissioners, and staff from the Bureau of Competition, an FTC spokesperson said. What they're saying: 'We have grave concerns over potential anticompetitive practices by large tech companies,\" James said in a statement. \"We are concerned that Facebook's actions may have put consumer data at risk of data breaches, reduced the quality of consumers' choices, and increased the price of advertising, so we will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to protect consumers and protect competition.' A Justice Department spokesperson declined comment. The bottom line: Pressure on Facebook and other tech companies is building from state capitals to Washington, where lawmakers and regulators are conducting their own investigations into the power of tech. A move by the states and DOJ to join forces would mirror the antitrust investigation of Microsoft in the '90s, in which the Justice Department and several state attorneys general together sued the company. Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from James and details about the state attorneys general meeting with the FTC.

Big announcement from us: The DealBook Summit is Nov. 6, and this year\u2019s speakers include Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, Reed Hastings, Brian Chesky, Ginni Rometty and Dennis Muilenburg. More below. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">Apply to attend here</url>.

And of this past May, the percentages of Fortune 500 C.E.O.s who were not part of that demographic were in the single digits.</p><p>Mr. Stringer\u2019s influence comes from his role as the overseer of five municipal public pension funds, which together manage over $200 billion in assets. He has used it over the past five years to demand corporate governance changes, including giving shareholders the ability to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">directly nominate board members</url>.</p><p>The companies that Mr. Stringer has reached out to include AT&amp;amp;T, Boeing and Walt Disney, none of which have any version of that rule. Other companies, including Amazon, Facebook and G.E., require diversity to be factored into searches for board members, but not C.E.O.s.</p><p>\u201cIn New York City, we refuse to believe that diverse candidates don\u2019t exist,\u201d Mr. Stringer said in a statement. \u201cAs a pension system, we want to invest in 21st-century companies that represent the future \u2014 not companies with management teams that look like they\u2019re out of the 1950s.\u201d</p><p>Meet the DealBook Summit speakers</p><p>On Nov. 6, Andrew will speak with top names from business, politics and beyond on a variety of topics, including corporate America\u2019s role in society, breaking up Big Tech, the streaming wars, Washington, I.P.O.s and the crisis at Boeing.</p><p>Among the speakers:</p><p>Bill Gates, co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Hillary Clinton, former U.S. senator, secretary of state and presidential candidate; Ginni Rometty, chairwoman and C.E.O. of IBM; Reed Hastings, co-founder, chairman and C.E.O. of Netflix; Dara Khosrowshahi, C.E.O. of Uber; Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general and head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division; Valerie Jarrett, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chairwoman of When We All Vote; Brian Chesky, co-founder and C.E.O. of Airbnb; Alex Gorsky, chairman and C.E.O. of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson; Stephanie Lampkin, founder and C.E.O. of Blendoor; Dennis Muilenburg, chairman and C.E.O. of Boeing; Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram; and Manuel Oliver, founder of the gun safety group Change the Ref.</p><p>It was game on for the N.B.A. in China last night</p><p>After a tense week between the N.B.A. and China, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">the Brooklyn Nets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers</url> in an exhibition game in Shanghai.</p><p> \u201cThe fact that the game was played at all represented a retreat from the brink by both sides, restoring some normalcy in the midst of a geopolitical storm set off by a since-deleted tweet by a Houston Rockets executive supporting antigovernment protesters in Hong Kong,\u201d write James Areddy and Ben Cohen of the WSJ.</p><p> The night had \u201cthe air of a playoff thriller, with a story line that threatened to undo decades worth of the N.B.A.\u2019s cultivation of its most promising overseas market.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThere had been signals the game might not happen. N.B.A. advertising posters disappeared from spots around Shanghai over the last few days, and Chinese authorities banned the game from airing on state-run television.\u201d</p><p> \u201cChinese authorities kept everyone guessing until hours before the game, and the N.B.A. said that its executives and players wouldn\u2019t speak to the media after the game \u2014 a break from the league\u2019s protocols.\u201d</p><p>More: The Chinese government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">moved to tamp down anger</url> against the N.B.A. on state media. And a coach in Activision Blizzard\u2019s Overwatch League was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">told to delete a tweet</url> condemning the company for censoring a competitor over his support of the Hong Kong protests. </p><p>Deutsche Bank says it doesn\u2019t have Trump\u2019s federal tax returns</p><p>The German bank <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">told a federal appeals court</url> yesterday that it does not have President Trump\u2019s tax returns, David Enrich of the NYT reports.</p><p>House committees subpoenaed Deutsche Bank last year seeking financial records pertaining to the president, his family and his companies. But Mr. Trump sued the bank to block it from complying.</p><p>The appeals court blocked his request yesterday. \u201cPart of the reason, it said, was that Deutsche Bank had informed the court that \u2018the only tax returns it has for individuals and entities named in the subpoenas are not those of the president,\u2019\u201d Mr. Enrich writes</p><p>Mr. Trump broke decades of presidential precedent in refusing to release his tax returns. But \u201cDemocrats are keen to obtain the documents, believing they are crucial to unlocking his closely guarded financial secrets,\u201d Mr. Enrich writes.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear when Deutsche Bank stopped holding those documents. Current and former officials previously told the NYT that the lender collected at least some of them in 2011, and that they were reviewed by bank officials.</p><p>Boeing and F.A.A. are faulted for 737 Max problems</p><p>A multiagency task force convened by the F.A.A. has found that Boeing and the aviation regulator <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">both made mistakes</url> in the certification of the airplane model that was involved in two fatal crashes, David Gelles and Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT report, citing a draft of the group\u2019s report.</p><p> \u201cThe review\u2019s scope was narrow: It only scrutinized the F.A.A.\u2019s certification of the Max\u2019s flight control system. But that allowed the task force to review the certification of the new automated system, MCAS, that played a role in both crashes, in Indonesia last October and in Ethiopia in March.\u201d</p><p> The report found that \u201cBoeing had failed to inform the F.A.A. as the design of MCAS changed during the plane\u2019s development.\u201d</p><p> \u201cBoeing also failed to thoroughly stress-test the design of MCAS, according to the report, which found that \u2018the design assumptions were not adequately reviewed, updated or validated.\u2019\u201d</p><p> \u201cWhile the F.A.A. had been made aware of MCAS, \u2018the information and discussions about MCAS were so fragmented and were delivered to disconnected groups\u2019 that it \u2018was difficult to recognize the impacts and implications of this system.\u2019\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe task force said it believed that if F.A.A. technical staff had been fully aware of the details of MCAS, the agency would probably have required additional scrutiny of the system that might have identified its flaws.\u201d</p><p>James Murdoch invests in Vice</p><p>The former C.E.O. of 21st Century Fox and the younger son of Rupert Murdoch <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">bought a stake in Vice Media</url>, Ed Lee of the NYT reports.</p><p>The investment was part of Vice\u2019s recent $400 million deal to acquire Refinery29, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. Mr. Murdoch made the investment through Lupa Systems, the company he formed after leaving 21st Century Fox.</p><p> James Murdoch made $2 billion from the sale of most of the Fox empire to Walt Disney, which he has used to invest in several media companies.</p><p>He already sits on Vice\u2019s board and is \u201cless interested in traditional news ventures,\u201d Mr. Lee writes, citing an unnamed source.</p><p>And he has another strong connection to the company. In June, Vice hired as its head of global news and entertainment Jesse Angelo, the former publisher of the N.Y. Post who is a close friend of Mr. Murdoch.</p><p>Revolving door</p><p>SAP <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">has replaced its C.E.O.</url>, Bill McDermott, with two executives, Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.</p><p>Greg Foran is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">stepping down as Walmart\u2019s head of U.S. stores</url>.

Stiroh at the Global Association of Risk Professionals Global Risk Forum:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been collaborating with GARP on this forum for a decade and it is always a pleasure to participate. This discussion provides real-time insight into critical issues at the center of the practice of risk management.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"A quick scan of today's agenda highlights a number of topics of obvious importance--operational resilience, cyclical aspects of risk management, technology and big data. We are all thinking about these issues, and I look forward to your insights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'd like to briefly discuss two topics where I expect risk managers will increase their focus in coming years--climate change and the cultural aspects of digital transformation. Both issues reflect potentially transformative trends for the economy and the financial system, and I believe they will take an increasing share of your bandwidth over the next decade. In both cases, the relevant questions from a supervisors' perspective are: what new risks are introduced? How do firms manage them? And how do supervisors view them?</p><p>\"Before proceeding, I will emphasize that I am speaking for myself and these views do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or the Federal Reserve System.</p><p>Climate</p><p>\"The U.S. economy has experienced more than $500 billion in direct losses over the last five years due to climate and weather-related events./1 In addition, climate change has significant consequences for the U.S. economy and financial sector through slowing productivity growth, asset revaluations and sectoral reallocations of business activity./2</p><p>\"For these climate-related risks, a new lexicon has emerged. Physical risk is the potential for losses as climate-related changes disrupt business operations, destroy capital and interrupt economic activity. Transition risk is the potential for losses resulting from a shift toward a lower-carbon economy as policy, consumer sentiment and technological innovations impact the value of certain assets and liabilities. These effects will be felt across business sectors and asset classes, and on the strategies, operations and balance sheets of financial firms.</p><p>\"Risk managers must be aware of these risks and develop the tools needed to identify, monitor and manage them appropriately. Physical and transition risks may manifest through traditional risk stripes such as credit, market, operational, legal and reputational risk, but today's tools are not necessarily well-suited for the unique challenges associated with climate change. Let me mention three of these challenges.</p><p>\"First, climate change is a long-term issue where actions today are likely to have an impact over many decades. This exceeds the typical life span of a bank exposure, as well as the typical control and planning horizon of a financial institution. Risk management tools, models and scenarios are not designed to capture the long-term nature of climate-related risks./3 Nonetheless, real impacts are already being felt and we must develop the tools to assess and manage them.</p><p>\"Second, climate change is complex--the impacts are uncertain, non-linear and hard-to-predict. Trusted credit models, for example, may prove less useful if the historical patterns of the frequency and severity of weather-related shocks become a poor guide to the distribution of future losses. Asset prices may move sharply, and unpredictably, as consensus views change and future impacts are priced today. Moreover, transition risks may stem from second-order, indirect effects like the impact on supply chains, sectoral shifts or worker productivity, which are inherently difficult to model and predict.</p><p>\"Third, we face significant data gaps. Climate change is a global phenomenon, but risks should be assessed locally, which requires new data such as asset-specific, geo-spatial data. Borrower-specific analysis requires data, for example, on asset utilization and climate effects for particular industries at particular locations. Such granular data is currently limited and requires significant resources to acquire and process, but greater transparency about the physical location of assets will allow institutions to better assess exposures to at-risk borrowers or to specific geographic risks.</p><p>\"As supervisors, we can consider climate-related risks in terms of both microprudential and macroprudential objectives. To be clear, in my view, supervisors should take a risk management perspective, not a social engineering one. It is beyond our mandate to advocate or provide incentives for a particular transition path. Rather, supervisors should focus on the risks that emerge along the path decided by the public at large and their elected governments. Supervisors can use our tools to ensure financial institutions are prepared for and resilient to all types of relevant risks, including climate-related events.</p><p>\"To do this, we must continue to invest in research to better understand the economic and financial impact of climate-related events. For example, on Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco will host a conference on the economics of climate change. We can also continue to follow closely and learn from the approaches taken by other central banks, including the use of scenario analysis, stress testing and supervisory expectations to encourage institutions to factor climate risk into their risk management practices. Finally, we can seek to strengthen the data and modeling capabilities we need to assess climate-related risks as part of our forward-looking, data-driven supervision.</p><p>\"Given the far-reaching impact of climate risk on the structure of the economy and the financial sector, I am confident that risk managers will respond appropriately and firms will continue to build resilience to all risks. GARP, for example, is exploring this and has recently surveyed its members to better understand professional needs for \"sustainability, climate risk, and ESG integration.\"/4 I am interested to hear from all of you about how your institutions are developing tools and practices to integrate climate risk into your risk management frameworks.</p><p>Innovation and Culture</p><p>\"It is no surprise to this audience that technological innovation, big data, and advanced analytics are transforming financial services. We can debate where we are on the maturity curve and what innovations are most likely to be transformative, but the direction of travel seems clear. I expect the afternoon session on \"Technology, Big Data, and the Practice of Risk Management\" will address core issues such as new approaches for model risk management in a world of widespread artificial intelligence; the inherent challenge of \"explainability\" and potential bias in algorithms; the strategic risks from new entrants; and the impact on human capital strategies.</p><p>\"I want to highlight a complementary, but different issue and focus on how firms manage these changes. More broadly, what type of corporate culture is needed to support a successful digital transformation?</p><p>\"Over the past five years, the New York Fed has emphasized the importance of a healthy culture to reduce misconduct risk. In addition, I think there is likely a link between a firm's culture and its ability to adapt to a changing environment, whether it is technological innovation, demographic change, new business models, or climate change. Firms need a culture that allows change and is resilient to these trends.</p><p>\"In discussions of the impact of technology on financial services, for example, one extreme view is that new fintech entrants--either smaller start-ups or big-tech firms--will leverage technology and a customer-centric approach to disrupt the industry and outcompete stagnant incumbents, fundamentally transforming the industrial organization of financial services. An alternative, equally extreme view, is that incumbent financial firms with established customer bases, scale, vast quantities of data, and experience working in a regulated environment will \"disrupt themselves\" and maintain their central position in finance. The most likely outcome, as is typically the case, is somewhere in the middle, but change seems inevitable.</p><p>\"If all firms face a strategic imperative to innovate and adapt, a relevant question is what types of firm-specific factors will determine success? Clearly, things like business model, technological expertise, and resources will matter. I think that firm culture will also matter./5 And by culture, I mean the values and shared norms within a group that influence individual behavior, collective decision-making and outcomes.</p><p>\"As firms innovate and transform how financial services are provided, I expect we'll see the value of leadership from senior managers and boards as they outline the strategic case for change and exhibit the critical behaviors that promote it. I expect we'll see the value of innovative environments where employees speak up, both raising new ideas and questioning assumptions. I expect we'll see the value of cognitive diversity as firms tackle complex problems like a digital transformation from multiple perspectives. I expect we'll see the value of agility that facilitates product innovation, reprioritization, constructive partnerships, or the successful integration of financial market specialists and technologists. Finally, I expect we'll see the value of well-crafted incentives where employees are rewarded based on both \"what\" they do and \"how\" they do it.</p><p>\"More broadly, I think firms with high levels of \"cultural capital\" will be more likely to successfully implement a digital transformation in a sustainable, prudent and responsible manner./6 This is a central question for risk managers and supervisors because the evidence suggests that most large-scale transformations fail./7 Just like firms, investors and supervisors consider execution risk when assessing bank mergers, I expect more attention will focus on culture and the change management risks associated with innovation and digital transformation.</p><p>\"In my view, the official sector can facilitate this transition. The 2018 guidance on responsible innovation related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing is a good example./8 Supervisors can also press on the governance and change management framework to promote effective internal oversight. From our perspective, supervisors also need to be nimble and develop the necessary skills to assess innovation as firms transform.</p><p>\"While a firm's culture is not directly observable, I believe this will prove to be a critical part of any change initiative. Technological progress, innovation, and new models of competition are changing the financial industry and there will undoubtedly be winners and losers. Understanding all of the factors that drive successful transformations will be a critical insight for both risk managers and supervisors.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>\"The financial sector is large, complex and constantly evolving due to a wide range of technological, business, and macro factors. Your job, and ours, is to be vigilant and open-minded in our thinking, constantly questioning our traditional assumptions and scanning the horizon to understand how the risk landscape is changing.</p><p>\"The topics covered at today's conference are some of the most important risks that the industry faces. Climate change and digital transformation are two powerful trends with the potential to fundamentally change financial services.

Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it. In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash \u2014 Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank \u2014 to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny. That is not the path the companies are taking. 'The tech companies are not flinching,' said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. 'Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They're going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.'  'For all intents and purposes, we're only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,' said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. 'The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.' My take: Apple has been largely\u2014but apparently not completely\u2014successful in distancing itself from the bad odor that surrounds 'big tech.' BTW, Streitfeld, who is very good, is also the resident luddite on the Times' West Coast tech team.

Happy Thursday, everybody, good morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 14th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation now.  At the central of the probe, the social media giant's data deals with other technology companies, it comes after a major outage at Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Grounded now, President Trump is keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked as new reports say that the Ethiopian Airlines crash shows similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.  There was evidence at the scene of that Ethiopian accident which caused the President to ground these planes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A deadly and historic blizzard, bringing hurricane-force winds to the Central United States.  More than 1,000 flights canceled at Denver's airport this morning.  The storm is set to affect more than 70 million Americans.  And out on bond, actress Lori Loughlin is posting $1 million in bond after appearing in court for her alleged role in the college admission scandal -- we have the very latest.  There's a new report says that the scam was uncovered by accident.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Markets this morning are higher.  Take a look, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning.  The Dow Industrials right now up 50 points, as you see, a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 also higher by 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ up 17-1/4 points this morning.  It looks like we will see a firmer opening this morning once the market is open.</p><p>Our top story this hour, Facebook is under fire again this morning.  The company reportedly facing now a criminal investigation over controversial data-sharing deals.  This, after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp across the globe.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Dagen, what's your take?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That it's just incredible the way the story is developing and the recklessness that Facebook behaved with in terms of revealing people's data on the service.  So, this is according to the New York times, that federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into these data-sharing deals that Facebook struck with some of the world's largest technology companies.  Again, shining an even brighter spotlight on the social media companies' business practices.</p><p>There's -- a grand jury in New York had subpoenaed records from at least two prominent makers of smart phones and other devices.  This is according to reporting in the New York Times.  These companies are among 150, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Sony, that at one point, cut data-sharing deals with Facebook.  The agreement which were originally revealed in the New York Times let these companies see users' friends, contact information, other data about individuals, sometimes without consent.</p><p>Facebook says that it's phased out most of these partnerships over the last couple of years.  This -- so this is a -- this is a grand jury of inquiry overseen by prosecutors.  This is the eastern district of New York, but let's also talk about the federal trade commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Facebook's behavior.  Also, the Justice Department's securities fraud unit has been investigating.  And this is in the northern district of California.  The situation around the Cambridge Analytica data sharing.  Remember Facebook back in -- I think it was 2011, signed a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission because it was sharing data in ways that deceit consumers, what's the fallout from that?</p><p>Meantime, Facebook was down yesterday, also Instagram, also WhatsApp, it owns all three of those companies.  Down for at least 11 hours as of early Thursday, and the outage could force Facebook potentially to issue refunds to advertisers.  And, of course, we were all just angry as you know what, that we couldn't get on to Instagram yesterday.  Right, Maria?  Back to you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we were.  But this criminal investigation is a big story.  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed.  And again, where does it lead, and is Facebook now face -- remember, it's going to pivot its business to a more private communications.  Well, nothing is -- nothing is private if you're operating on a Facebook platform.  I think that the company has made that pretty clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because that's how they make money.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Advertising and data.  All right, Dagen, we'll keep following that.  Meanwhile, this is the big story as well, this morning, grounding the 737 Max altogether.  The United States making this decision with the Federal Aviation Administration, after finding new data linking Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash and last October's Lion Air crash.  President Trump commented on the move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED:  We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 738 Max 9, and the planes associated with that line.  Planes that are in the air will be grounded if they are the 737 Max, will be grounded upon landing at the destination.  The pilots have been notified.  Airlines have been all notified.  Airlines are agreeing with this, the safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Roman &amp; Associates founder and CEO, Anthony Roman.  Anthony, thanks very much for weighing in here.</p><p>ANTHONY ROMAN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, ROMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is one of the most widely used planes across the country, right, and the world?</p><p>ROMAN:  It is becoming one of the most widely used planes.  And it's a fascinating aircraft with a 10 percent savings in fuel consumption.  That's an enormous amount of money during global operations.  It's also the best-selling aircraft in history, 5100 firm orders for Boeing.  And Boeing is set to lose $25 billion in market value.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, it's already lost 25 billion market value since the Ethiopian crash happened.  The stock is down about 10 percent.  But what about this plane, what do we need to know about this plane?  I mean, the fact that the FAA is now grounding all of the planes, travelers also are reacting to the 737's grounding.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do trust airlines.  I do understand that any aircraft or any kind of anything could have an issue at any time.  It doesn't mean everything is bad, or -- I feel pretty safe flying.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Actually, I was flying back from Daytona Beach, American Airlines today.  Did a couple of flights, and I wanted to make sure what plane I was getting on, because I've probably wouldn't have gotten on the Max.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a known safety concern, and certainly we're putting in the effort to figure it out before anything else happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anthony, what's your take on all of this?</p><p>ROMAN:  Well, you know, pilots knew there was a problem, the FAA knew there was a problem, prior to Lion Air and immediately following Lion Air.  The FAA reported in a worthiness directive, to of Boeing to redo some of the computer code on the MCAS and auto pilot system.  That's not done unless they know there is some type of flaw in the system.  But they have not reported to the public what that flaw may have been.</p><p>There were five pilot reports to the National Safety Reporting System.  Identical problems to the Lion Air situation and similar to what we see on the satellite data in the oscillations in the takeoff phase, in Ethiopian air as well.  And these captains, seasoned U.S. carrier captains reported to NASA that there were pitch oscillations, pitched down uncommanded actions by the aircraft, auto-throttles during the takeoff phase, not being in the correct position despite the input data placed in the computers by the pilot are verified to be correct.  So, all sorts of problems with this aircraft.</p><p>The issue is, these airplanes are much more complicated than airplanes in the early 2000s, the 90s, and the 80s.  These are highly-computerized machines, so not only are we dealing with more complexity in engines and systems, but now hundreds, if not millions of lines of code in these computer systems that have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Because after the Lion Air crash, the CEO of Boeing told us that there were -- there was an issue that needed -- the pilots needed to be updated about, that the plane was upgraded, there was a change in some of the operations, the pilot needed to be aware of those.  Is there -- is it beyond that that the pilots just need to be educated about this plane, or is it something bigger than that?</p><p>ROMAN:  Well, usually, accident phases are a combination of issues.  And the pilot, the lack of pilot awareness that this system was operating in the background, and the lack of pilot training to overcome, to recognize and overcome any anomalies in this system is just a failure.  Basically, it had to be a cost-savings failure, because training time costs money, and the aviation industry is constantly trying, like all businesses, to drive its cost down.  Not the best way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we'll be watching this.  Obviously, a major impact to Boeing, but the safety of Americans is the administrations show its concern so they grounded all of them.  Anthony, thanks very much for weighing in.  Appreciate it very much.  Anthony Roman joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, as you saw on the screen, Beto O'Rourke officially announcing his 2020 Presidential bid.  We're going to talk about that this morning.  And then there's this, deadly blizzard conditions in Colorado and across the country this morning.  Cheryl Casone with all of that in headlines.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria, good morning.  Nearly 1400 flights canceled at Denver International after a bomb cyclone hit the airport there.  Look at these pictures, wind gusts as strong as 80 miles an hour.  Elsewhere in Colorado, a police officer hit and killed while outside his vehicle, helping with the car that had skidded off of Interstate 76.  Now, to Texas, small planes overturned like toys at a municipal airport by high winds.  Strong winds also a major problem in New Mexico that caused a train to derail there.  This is incredible.</p><p>And then, look at this, again, back to Texas, stunning videos, strong winds blew over a tractor trailer.  It was -- it was unbelievable.  We'll show it to you, hopefully, in a moment.  It wasn't the only one, though, there's been reports of wind speeds up to 70 miles per hour, causing multiple trucks to blow over.  This is happening in different parts of the country.  No word on the conditions of the driver.  Again, we'll get that video to you later in the show.</p><p>All right, the college admission scandal is now in federal court, actress Lori Loughlin posting $1 million bond in Los Angeles.  She and her fashion designer husband are among 50 people facing fraud charges for allegedly paying bribes to get their daughters into colleges.  One of the schools in the heart of the scandal, University of Southern California.  The university says applicants who are connected to the admissions cheating scheme are going to be denied admission.  A case-by-case review will be conducted for students who are already enrolled at USC and may be connected to the scheme.</p><p>And ABC News reports the FBI uncovered the $25 million nationwide college admissions cheating scandal by accident, while agents were working on unrelated securities fraud cases.  The agents reportedly received a tip from somebody that was connected to the investigation about the alleged bribe, paid to the then-head women's soccer coach at Yale.  Maria, this story just continues to fascinate the country, and a lot of kids that didn't get into those schools, I'm sure, are pretty angry as their parents are as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  With good reason.  Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, as we just heard, Beto O'Rourke makes his Presidential announcement official.  We've got a lot more on that after a short break.  Stay with us, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big show this morning.  Coming up right here, South Dakota Senator and Armed Services Committee member Mike Rounds is with us.  Oregon Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member Greg Walden with some breaking news this morning from him.  Former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, and Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us after an op-ed this morning.  And former Presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee, joining us as well.  Big three hours ahead.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>We want to talk right here about Huawei.  It is in court today, lawyers for the Chinese telecom giant expected to appear in federal court later this morning, to answer charges that the company violated Iran trade tensions.  Huawei is accused of dealing with Iran through a front company in Hong Kong.  The company's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada, accused of lying to banks about it.  She's now awaiting extradition to the United States.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate Steve Forbes joining us here.  Along with national security analyst and Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're welcome.  Yes, I mean, this Huawei story keeps getting worse.  I know that they arrested her because of the Iran sanctions, and dealing with Iran.  But there's also obviously, the privacy issues and the espionage that we've been talking about so much, Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.  And the Iran sanctions violations are very serious.  I mean, what we've seen is over the past 10 years, probably, millions and millions of dollars paid by financial institutions, especially those based in New York as it relates to Iran sanctions.  You're seeing most major banks on Wall Street have mediators and have people that are working on a daily basis to improve their systems, so they don't evade sanctions.  So, to think that this is a sort of a one-off for this company is actually wrong.  I mean, anybody in Wall Street can tell you that they're running scared of any sort of violation of Iran sanctions.  It's quite serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I look at the Iran sanctions as one part of it, but really, the more -- the interesting part from my standpoint is the espionage issues, and the fact that it's gone across the world and to African countries and European countries, will set up your telecom infrastructure.  No worries.  And then, of course, they're tapping into their conversations and data.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And unfortunately there, they've got a huge head start.  But what I think it's eventually going to save us in the next few years, and we'll get real 5G out there.  It's going to be a whole different architecture, massive new investments are going to be required.  In that way, we can keep the Huawei's of the world out.  Also underscores in terms of our dispute with China.  Going after that CFO, going after specific companies, is a far more effective way of dealing with China than the tariffs, which end up hurting us not as much as China.  But we get hurt too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm curious, Steve, are enough of our allies standing alongside of us in terms of pushing back on Huawei and the use of that technology.  Because, again, you've seen with -- which Maria was way ahead on in her interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to crack down, and the message that we sent to Germany about we're not going to -- we're going to pull back on our intelligence share if you don't get in -- you get on board with us in terms of taking on Huawei.  And then the grave danger of that poses to all other nations in terms of the espionage and the theft, are enough of our allies standing with us?  Because they're (INAUDIBLE) few at this point.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think they had to see how serious are we about this.  It's one thing to say, oh, well, why don't you do this and that, but if you don't follow through one, they're not going to follow through.  And I think our -- one of the things Huawei did was to make their stuff so cheap.  It was a lost leader to get in there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was just going to say there's a cost issue here, right?</p><p>FORBES:  And so all of these countries got this great bargain, 50 percent off, and now they're indebted.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Nothing is ever free.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nothing is free.  There's no free lunch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even small telecom providers here in the United States have used Huawei technology, and that is another later, another issue for this administration to tackle, because again, they're complaining about higher costs if they use different telecom equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really serious issue.  And by the way, sidelining this issue is this potential trade deal with China.  I think it's very ominous that we haven't heard yet, any specific date for Xi Jinping to meet with President Trump as they were expecting to do at the end of March in Mar-a-Lago.  Where do these trade discussions stand now?  It sure feels like China is pushing back on making any changes to the I.P. theft and the forced transfer of technology.  All we've heard in terms of the give on China side is they're going to buy more stuff from the U.S. which is not going to cut it for a deal with the U.S.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, the question is about enforcement is one of the things we want to do to be able to put tariffs on Chinese goods and they can't put tariffs on ours if we think they're engage in violations, the Chinese are not going to go along with that.  And so, well, what you have here is a game of chicken, and I think the key thing is, if we continue to do what we did against Huawei and some other companies, that's the message to get across.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the message is to punish bad actors but not punish companies like, say, European automakers that make cars here in the U.S. that create U.S. jobs.  It's important to point out that we've heard earlier this week that the momentum seems to be slipping for auto import tariff, something that President Trump has talked about a lot, a 25 percent levy potentially on car imports to the United States.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  That's so called Section 232.  If that came, then that would devastate the global economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it would hurt U.S. jobs.  These are companies across the south, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, that have been real job creators in the United States.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they have.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're actually -- they're helping our trade deficit by exporting cars overseas that they make here.</p><p>FORBES:  BMW is ready to export 100,000 vehicles they make in South Carolina.  What's not to like?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  So, that's -- this is a positive sign.  Punish the bad actors but people who actually create jobs here in the United States who are on our side, ease up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a short break on that note.  And when we come back, a modern day mob hit.  The alleged boss of the Gambino crime family was gunned down outside of his home.  We've got the details coming up right after this.  And then, Gary Cohn speaking out, President Trump's former economic adviser says the President is \"desperate\" to sign a deal with China, that's next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are mixed right now, pretty good reversal in the last 20 minutes, Dow Industrials now down four points, the S&amp;P down a quarter, and the NASDAQ is up six.  Market uncertainty this morning.  There's some uncertainty obviously over Britain's exit from the European Union as well as a deal between the U.S. and China.  Now, Gary Cohn, former economic adviser to President Trump spoke out on a deal with China in a new interview, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY COHN, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think the U.S. is desperate right now for an agreement.</p><p>STEPHEN DUBNER, HOST, FREAKONOMICS:  An agreement or headline?</p><p>COHN:  The President needs a win.  The only big open issue right now that he could claim as a big win, that he hope would have a big impact on the stock market would be Chinese resolution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A new report now says that the U.S. and China are pushing back a meeting between the President and Xi Jinping to at least April of this year.  Joining us right now is Russell Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Kevin Divney.  Kevin, it's good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>KEVIN DIVNEY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is that meeting and this deal between the two countries for the markets?</p><p>DIVNEY:  The market's pricing in that something is going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DIVNEY:  And if you saw last earnings season, the thing that was hurting U.S. earnings was Chinese exposure.  The Chinese economy is hurting much more than the U.S. economy, and it seems as if the market is shrugging off any kind of headline risk, and they're looking to what's going on the -- what's going on the ground in China.  So, the market is pricing it in, and there's probably some more risk to the upside here.  And a lot of risk to the downside if something doesn't happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then you've got Brexit, Parliament shuts down the latest deal for Britain's exit from the European Union.  The M.P.s voted yesterday to reject the no-deal exit under any circumstances.  Prime Minister Theresa May expected to try one more plan this week before a potential vote to delay Britain's exit from the European Union, is that a factor for you, for markets?</p><p>DIVNEY:  Fundamentally, European economies are decoupling from the U.S., who see PMIs almost getting to negative territory.  You see earnings decelerate, you see spending coming down.  U.S. companies are growing and they're still investing.  So, I think investors have hedged that away and looking at the momentum of the U.S. economy and the labor market here.  So, it's being compartmentalize, and from an allocation perspective, I think a lot of people are just looking at the U.S. robustness right now.</p><p>FORBES:  Can the U.S. stay robust if China and Japan and Europe, Germany, especially are still in the water?</p><p>DIVNEY:  I think so.  There's two main drivers we're looking at, one, the labor market is really strong right now.  You see labor force participation from that really high earning, high spending group, 25 to 54, has been gone from 80 percent of its low three years ago to 83 percent.  Also on earnings, if you look at this market expansion, a lot of the expansion has been driven by the profit margin expansion.  So earnings have grown, we have the 10-year anniversary last night at the bull market.  But most Bull Markets have been driving about a third by profit growth.  In this expansion, something about two thirds of profit growth.  So, even last earnings season, we saw profits flatten and they may go down a bit, but we're at peak margins, and the topline sales expectations for the U.S. have not been revised down meaningfully.  Everybody knows earnings have going into 2019, but the topline is still around five or six percent --</p><p>FORBES:  Are you worried about the slowness in the first quarter in the U.S. economy, or is that just a blip?</p><p>DIVNEY:  It's reminding me of what happened in 2015, 2016, which was somewhat fascinating, because you saw an earnings contraction and an earnings expansion after that, for the first time without a recessions since the postwar period.  So, I think companies adapt and also the -- people coming back into the labor force is one of the big stories, I think people aren't really getting, people are coming back in, they were underemployed or unemployed, and that momentum continues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're not going to get the profit growth that we saw last year this year, that's for sure.  So, that's a worry that we're really are seeing a slowdown in the U.S., Europe on top of that, China on top of that.</p><p>DIVNEY:  Domestically-focused companies, tech-focused companies, high-margin companies, and it's a little bit ironic when you think about this, some people would pretend that you want to get into value defensive-type environments when you're in a contracting environment.  That will be a premium on growth shares.  Like premium on companies that have higher margin because if growth is more rare in the economy and we're starting to see consensus estimates for the second half drift up a little bit.  So, we're seeing (INAUDIBLE) Q2.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  And I know that now, many people are looking toward 2020.</p><p>DIVNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, would you put new money to work in small and mid-cap names, which is where you've been, right?</p><p>DIVNEY:  We're in all-cap and large-cap, but, yes, we're looking for the more pro-cyclical tech consumer cyclicals where we're looking to put more money to work and where we're exposed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin, it's good to have you on the show.</p><p>DIVNEY:  Thanks for being here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Kevin Divney joining us there.  Coming up, the race to 2020, Beto O'Rourke officially threw his hat in the ring.  We are all taking a look at the Presidential line-up.  And it is Pie Day.

Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 14th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news, Beto O'Rourke announces his 2020 bid, we're taking a look at the state of the 2020 election, coming up.</p><p>And Futures this morning are lower, take a look, we've seen a pretty good reversal in the last half an hour, we were looking at a higher opening earlier, now the Dow Industrials down 23 points, the S&amp;P 500 down 2 and a quarter, the NASDAQ is higher, but up just 1 point, right now.  It was a wild day of trading yesterday, the major indices finished the day higher, when all was said and done.</p><p>Dow Industrials up 148 points, two-thirds of 1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 yesterday up almost 20 points and the NASDAQ was up 52, at the close.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, higher across the board, FT 100 in London, up 41 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris up 22 and the DAX Index in Germany up just 3 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, the worst performer was China, Nikkei Average -- the Japanese market flat, but the Shanghai Composite down one and a quarter percent, in China.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is under pressure this morning, a California jury awarding a woman $29 million tied to a cancer diagnosis from baby powder.

This is defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Beto joins a growing list of contenders looking to unseat President Trump in next year's election, joining us right now is RealClearPolitics, White House Reporter, Philip Wegmann, Philip, good to have you on the program this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, REAL CLEAR POLITICS:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Beto?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, look, if magazine writers were the ones who decided who is going to be president of the United States, Beto O'Rourke would already be in the White House.  There have been so many magazine profiles about this guy, he's going to have to run the old-fashion way.</p><p>And I think what we're going to find out, what Beto O'Rourke is going to realize is that the other candidates who are competing against him are going to ask a lot tougher questions than a lot of the journalists who have been following him when he was challenging Senator Ted Cruz and who kept following him ever since.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They call him baby candidate, Dagen.  How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- well, I think that -- I have said this before, he would not be getting as nearly as much attention particularly from the media and celebrities in Hollywood if he'd looked like somebody else, but he does look like one of the candidates, quite frankly, number one.</p><p>Number two, he has got Annie Leibovitz's photographs in Vanity Fair, on the cover with his dog, to make him likable, that's not an accident.  And he said in the -- in the cover story, I want to be in it, man, I'm just born to be in it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Obnoxious.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has the advantage of the American people not knowing a whole lot about him at this point, he is a young face and he gave Ted Cruz a run for his money where he came within five percentage points, beating Ted Cruz in an increasingly purple state.</p><p>Again, I think people see him as a vice presidential candidate, but him with, say, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, historically, had trouble raising money, particularly in the presidential race, Beto can raise some money, we know that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's not running for vice president, he's running for president.</p><p>FORBES:  No, he's no more running for vice president under Barack Obama after sensational speech in the 2004 convention.  It was going to be settled (INAUDIBLE) in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are his policies?  What's his messaging?  What is he going to do?</p><p>FORBES:  His messaging --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the last time we went voting --</p><p>FORBES:  All of the candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for someone who's attractive, we didn't like the policies at the end of the day.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they're all the same.  They're all trying to find new ways, going after cows and things like that to distinguish themselves (INAUDIBLE) field.  And so, his thing is going to be, he's better looking, he's got the glamor, he's got good photographers and that kind of stuff, sort of the Kennedy thing, but substance free --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, you know what?</p><p>FORBES:  In terms of distinguishing himself from other candidates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But maybe you can be substance free because the substance has been regurgitated by the candidates who are already out there, is appalling and unappealing to a lot of Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you mean like the Green Deal?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- of wealth confiscation, Medicare-for-all, which by the way, I want to point out Bernie Sanders' bill that Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, all signed on to that eradicates and abolishes and outlaws --</p><p>FORBES:  Using Medicare is false advertising, but it's not Medicare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  You know, I have a question for Philip, so Slate Magazine, which is not exactly a conservative publication, actually hit Beto, and said that he has --</p><p>WEGMANN:  Right.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  -- I'm paraphrasing them, but he -- they said he has no idea why he's running, is an entitled rich, white guy, actually the future of the Democratic Party?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, I mean, that's going to be the script that I think a lot of the opposition is going to lodge against him.  Because he -- they're going to try and paint him as a sort of holding coffee old type who is aimless, who lost his last bid and who really hasn't done a lot to, you know, deserve the type of nomination.</p><p>And I think that those are going to be incredibly powerful attacks, when like, Steve said a second ago, this is not going to be necessarily the most substantive debate about who the nominee should be because the field is already so far left.</p><p>So, we're going to see a personality-driven race, that's my thought from a lot of (INAUDIBLE) talking to.  And I think that his competition is going to be a lot of the more charismatic, energetic candidates on the left, who kind of do fill that Obama lane.  And my thought here is perhaps Beto O'Rourke might be too late.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In this field, you only-- if you're a Democrat, you only have to, kind of, be normal and not -- and not crazy and extreme.  You have a Democratic Party that is not only getting behind abolishing all private health insurance in this country.</p><p>Basically driving up the price of gasoline and all fossil fuels, our electricity bills, to the moon, which crushes the poor, but also the party of, well, anti-Semitism and infanticide because there has not been enough pushback from the leadership in the party and from some of these candidates on the anti-Semitic comments and on the third trimester abortion bills.</p><p>FORBES:  And another thing in this field, when you look at most of these candidates is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- not only they are not having any real differences on issues, but what have they done with their lives.  Bernie didn't get a job until he was 53.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, is that right?  I did not know that.  We got to get to this.  Let me ask you this, Philip, because Andrew Weissmann, one of the most prominent members of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, will leave the Justice Department.  That's according to two sources speaking to NPR.</p><p>We know that this is an individual who was at the Department of Justice when they first came up with the dossier, from Fusion GPS, he knew that the dossier was paid by Hillary Clinton.  And two weeks ago, Congresswoman Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows sent a letter to William Barr, saying we want accountability.</p><p>What did he say about the fact he's totally conflicted because he knew about the dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for it, and now, he's Special Counsel's assistant or deputy?</p><p>WEGMANN:  So, I think what's interesting about Weissmann's exit is that this is a prosecutor who a lot of people in the Trump campaign were most worried about.  If you remember, it was Steve Bannon who called Weissmann, a killer, who said that he was the LeBron James of these types of investigations.</p><p>It seems that, you know, he was able to bring charges against Manafort, but so far, there hasn't been anything that has stuck against the President.  So, I think that the White House sees this as a precursor to the investigation wrapping up.  And for now, there's nothing that it seems that Weissmann was able to get against the President himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the letter from the congressmen, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows is sort of the catalyst that got him packing up?</p><p>WEGMANN:  You know, that's certainly possible, we don't know right now, because the thing about the Special Counsel is that, you know, they don't leak.</p><p>And so, that certainly could have been a (INAUDIBLE) for this, but where I think that from the NPR report which broke the story, the way that this is being seen right now, is that, you know, the things are wrapping up and finally after this multiyear saga, it might come to an end.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Philip, we'll leave it there.  Good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>WEGMANN:  Thank you, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Philip Wegmann, RealClearPolitics.</p><p>Meanwhile, a reputed mob boss was shot and killed outside of his home in New York City, Cheryl Casone with the details on that, Cheryl, what a story.</p><p>CASONE:  It really is, Maria.

Your reaction, Kat?</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think that it's really quite a sad thing that she's probably going to go to jail for this, to send a kid to school that openly admitted she has no interest in school.  She said, she want -- she's like, I'm not really into school, but I want to like go party; I want to go to the games.  That's like sadder than old (INAUDIBLE) than me.

But what really gets me is that they have the nerve to claim tax deduction.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIRO:  Are you serious?  Yes, I just can't believe it.  And I feel bad for the kids who really worked and tried so hard, that a spot was taken from them for something like this.</p><p>TIMPF:  This isn't victim less.  They could have gotten in and didn't because of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we wanted to get your reaction, all of you, because you're the millennial generation, just to see if there's a different way to view this.  Social media went nuts over this, as you know.  I mean, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp all talking about the scandals.  Dion, your take on it?</p><p>DION RABOUIN, AUTHOR, AXIOS MARKETS NEWSLETTER:  Yes, my take on this is just that, you know, I hope they all go to jail.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.  Well, look, here's the thing, there's not really a plea deal to be had here, you know.  It's like, we you got you on tape; we know that you did it.  We've got you talking about what you're going to do, how you're going to do it, what you plan on doing with the money, all that.  And there's not really a link up; there's no one up the chain that we want to get.  They've already got kind of the mastermind behind the scandal.  So, there's really no reason these guys should get a sweetheart deal or, you know, slap on the wrist; folks need to go to jail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, Morgan, I know that parents will do just about anything for their kids and to get their kids into colleges.  But this was a real structure, I mean, this was a very elaborate scheme.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, Maria.  What I'm hearing from my friends in Southern California is typical, like, any money launderer, or any front company.  This guy, he had like, legitimate tutoring business.  This goes really deep.  I spoke to her friend just two days ago, who tutored his daughters on the SAT, and said there was a number of legitimate things he did.  And what he would do is penetrate the wealthiest high schools.  He would reportedly work with some of the pride wealth managers.</p><p>Again, this is going to go so much deeper than what we realize; this was a real scheme.  And at a time, when we talk about millennials, we're actually facing such extremely high rates of college indebtedness, that people are still trying to pay off student loans.  They can't buy homes.  It's sort of, I think, a big slap on the face.  I know that I paid for my schools through scholarships and loans, and I'm still paying off my MBA.  And so, when you see that, when you're work hard to get these degrees and then you see it so blatantly taken advantage off.  It's really hard to swallow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and how about all those students who didn't get in because there wasn't a spot for them?  There's that as well.</p><p>TIMPF:  Who were actually qualified and could've gotten in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>TIMPF:  But Olivia Jade wanted a party at the football game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>TIMPF:  And had a rich mommy and daddy.  I'd be furious if I applied to USC and didn't get in, and then saw this was going on.</p><p>RABOUIN:  There are a lot of people who applied to the university of spoiled children, because they want --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  University of spoiled children.</p><p>BIRO:  The veteran in me wants them to go to military school now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, did any of you experience that outage last night on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp -- technical issues all day yesterday.  Facebook had to take to rival, Twitter, to explain what the heck was going on.  Social media users shared their responses to the technical difficulties.  We're going to show some on screen, what was your reaction?</p><p>TIMPF:  It was awful.  I was eating dinner yesterday, and I couldn't post a picture of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, no!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TIMPF:  It's like, why am I even eating at all?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hilarious!</p><p>BIRO:  Frankly, I was glad my screen time on my Apple app would go down.  Because I cringe every time, I'm like, oh, look at my screen time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's funny!  Guys, thank you.  I know you guys are coming back in the 8:00 a.m.  Thank you, Kat Timpf, Robin, Dion, and Morgan; we will see you in the next hour.  Still ahead, Donald Tusk's new friend; the European Council President sharing a heartwarming letter he received from a 6-year-old as Britain prepares for its exit from the E.U.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, March 14th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Boeing 737 Max jets have been grounded in the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Boeing is an incredible company.  And hopefully they'll very quickly come up with the answer but until they do, the planes are grounded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reports say that the Ethiopian Airlines crash shows similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.  There was some evidence at the site which caused the President to say all of the 737s should be grounded.  We've got the very latest this morning.</p><p>Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation now.  At the center of the probe, the social media giant's data deals with other technology companies.  It comes after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp yesterday.</p><p>And a deadly and historic blizzard brings hurricane force winds to the central U.S. -- look at this.  The high winds caused trains and tractor trailers to flip over entirely.  Incredible pictures there.</p><p>Britain's exit from the E.U. may not happen on March 29th now.  One British child' sends a heartwarming letter to the President of the European Council and it is going viral this morning.  We've got it.</p><p>Futures this morning indicating the markets will open lower.  We are at the lows of the morning this morning.  We have been weakening throughout the morning this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials now down 63 points, quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 down 6.  And the Nasdaq down 10 as you can see.</p><p>It was a wild day yesterday of trading, major indices finished higher when all was said and done.  Dow Industrials up 148 points at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up almost 20.  And the Nasdaq was up 52 points yesterday on Wall Street.</p><p>In Europe this morning the indices are mixed, mostly higher.  FT 100 up 28 points.  The CAC 40 in Paris 16.  The DAX index has turned lower.  It's down 19 points right now.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, mixed story there.  China was the worst performer.  Shanghai composite down 1.25 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, and national security analyst Fox News contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You, too.  Good to see you.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It will be interesting today.  Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan goes before Congress today for the first time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from that?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, he'll be with General Joe Dunford.  I think that he's going to get questioned a lot perhaps about the President's Syria policy.  And I think a lot of people are going to use this as an opportunity to grill him because they haven't since his contentious hearing for whenever he became deputy secretary.</p><p>FORBES:  And he has a Boeing background, doesn't he?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  So he'll get grilled on that as well.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Which is not necessarily fair, but yes.</p><p>FORBES:  It isn't fair but this is not a fair time.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>We're also watching markets which have worsened in the last half an hour.  Since we started the show, things have completely reversed course.</p><p>One of the issues seems to be GE.  The stock is down and the company is talking about 2019 issuing its outlook for the year.  The Dow Industrials are now down 69 points, the S&amp;P down 6 and the Nasdaq down 10.5.</p><p>We don't have any major economic data coming out this morning but you're seeing some individual stories really impacting the broader markets.  What do you think?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And I know that we're getting into the Boeing story right here.  But I think when you talk about the top exporter out of the United States, which Boeing is, in terms of overall sales and the most valuable -- or it was most valuable stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of the 30 stocks in the Dow, that you do have confidence that's been rattled.</p><p>I think that you -- when you feel like a brand as important as Boeing has been tarnished and people don't know what the road looks like ahead, if people are already on -- ready to sell, this could cause that.  Clearly, the stock has taken a big drive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Major dive.  Boeing shares have lost $25 billion since the Ethiopian crash.  That's about 10 percent on Boeing shares.</p><p>GE is falling out of bed this morning.  The company is reporting that 2019 earnings are going to be below expectations.  Stock is now down better than 4 percent.  They're talking about 50 to 60 cents a share in 2019 but that's lower than the estimate, which is currently for 70 cents a share.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  They always disappoint.  There's always something new coming along, something in the past keeps cropping up and so we have to remember, it got down as low as 6, got as high as above 10.  But they continue to disappoint.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  And this whole market, we shouldn't forget, has had a huge rally.  What it needs now is another piece of good news, i.e.  China trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we have not seen the meeting set.  Now, the President says that they're going to push this meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping until April of this year.  So we don't have a date yet.</p><p>And as you can see, all of this seems to be weighing on markets -- GE, Boeing, the uncertainty over a China trade deal.</p><p>And our top story this hour is, of course, Boeing.  The Federal Aviation Administration has announced that it will ground all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jets.  It comes amid new data linking Sunday's Ethiopian Airline's crash and last October's Lion Air crash.</p><p>President Trump announced the decision from the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition, to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and planes associated with that line.  I've spoken to Elaine Chao Secretary of Transportation, Dan Elwell acting administrator at the FAA, and to Dennis Muilenburg CEO of Boeing.</p><p>It's a terrible, terrible thing.  Boeing is an incredible company.  They are working very, very hard right now.  And hopefully they'll very quickly come up with the answer but until they do, the planes are grounded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is South Dakota senator, member of the Housing, Transportation and Community Development Subcommittee and pilot himself, Mike Rounds.  Senator -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about the Boeing situation?</p><p>ROUNDS:  Well, we don't know a whole lot more about it than what you've just shared.  To begin with, it's -- Boeing has a fantastic record to begin with.  The 737 by itself has a marvelous record for years and years.  The 737 Max, in particular the -8, this particular one now we've had two incidents.  They have been very unfortunate.  We've had loss of life.</p><p>The FAA does have a good system in place.  They've also received some what we call the NASA (ph) reports.  This is where if a pilot flying something that's not right, they can make an anonymous report that can help in terms of safety.  And that's been a very successful program, year in and year out.</p><p>My understanding is that there have been several reports that Boeing and the FAA may very well be able to go back in and pick up some additional data.  It sounds like they've also received some very accurate information using some satellite tracking data that does correlate some similarities between both of these incidents and I think that's the reason why they've taken this particular step to ground this aircraft at this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, as a pilot yourself, were there issues that the pilots were not aware of with the upgrade that the plane went through?  We haven't heard from Boeing which is an issue.</p><p>The CEO needs to come out and explain what's going on here.  Otherwise, we're seeing people sell now and think later.</p><p>ROUNDS:  You know what, what we find as pilots, we get trained based upon the type of aircraft that we're going to fly.  Pilots that are going to fly a 737, they'll get what they call a type rating which is specific to a particular type.</p><p>But within those type ratings they'll also have different upgrades to software.  And as the software becomes more and more complicated, the training that goes into it is critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROUNDS:  And that's part of the discussion that I think that they're going to have is are the pilots currently aware of what might happen?  Do they understand what's running in the background?  Do they know what happens in certain conditions either on take-off or on landing that they need to be aware of?</p><p>And at the same time, as they become more complicated, they can also add more and more safety features into the software that sometimes unless the pilot is aware of may seem to be a unique occurrence that they have to respond to.</p><p>But in this particular case and in future cases I am quite certain that the FAA will take a look at the software and the packages that go into them and they'll evaluate them.  But that's the reason we've got the FAA on top of it.  And I think they're perfectly capable of finding out what it is and working with Boeing to resolve this as quickly as possible.</p><p>The unfortunate part is we've had loss of life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in the meantime all of these planes are grounded in the U.S. as the FAA does that.  Travelers have been reacting to these groundings.  Here's what we found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK KELLER, AIRLINE PASSENGER:  I was flying back from Daytona Beach, American Airlines today with a couple of flights and I wanted to make sure what plane I was getting on because I probably wouldn't have gotten on the Max.</p><p>JEFF RUHDE, AIRLINE PASSENGER:  We had been talking about this issue and we're glad to know we don't have to fly home on one of those planes tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess there's more relief than anything else that these planes are grounded because people don't know.  It's an unknown.</p><p>Senator -- I've got to get your take on the big vote today, the bill to block the President's national emergency declaration.  How are you going to vote?</p><p>Senator?  Mike Rounds -- are you with us?</p><p>All right.  We want to fix the issues with Senator Mike Rounds and find out how he's going to vote.  We will get back to him as soon as that is fixed.  Do we have Senator Mike Rounds back?</p><p>All right.  Quick break, then.</p><p>Winter's last call -- parts of the country dealing with intense blizzard conditions.</p><p>Wanting to be friends meanwhile -- one British girl's heartfelt offer of friendship to the European Union.  Her message ahead.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I'm back with Senator Mike Rounds.  Senator, thank you so much.  Sorry about the technical issues.</p><p>The Senate is obviously going to vote today to block the President's national emergency declaration.  How are you voting?</p><p>ROUNDS:  I'll be supporting the President's position and on this particular vote, I think he has made the point that there is -- there is a national emergency at the border.  We're seeing it.</p><p>What's happening is we've got thousands, literally in some cases 76,000 individuals trying to get across in a month.  They're overwhelming the manpower that we've got at the southern border.</p><p>And in doing so now the Mexican drug cartels have figured it out and when we're busy just taking in these folks who are coming in and asking for asylum, they're finding ways to get into the rest of the country.  But they're crossing the border.  And it's not just at the ports of entry.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you've got five --</p><p>ROUNDS:  I'll support the President's position.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- five Republicans though are not and as a result it's likely going to pass the Senate, right.  And then the President will veto it.</p><p>ROUNDS:  That's right.  And I think, you know, this is the unfortunate part.  We thought there might be a way to put together a package deal to where those individuals could express the concerns that they've got with the constitutional issue surrounding the emergency declaration.</p><p>Unfortunately we weren't able to resolve it with the White House and we end up in this a situation where the President will probably have to exercise his veto authority which would then be sustained by the House when it comes before them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think that this would actually -- that the re-appeal, fighting back the President's veto will actually come to pass?</p><p>ROUNDS:  I don't think that they'll be able to override the President's veto.  That's correct.</p><p>Look, I really think the biggest challenge is going to come in October as we move forward with the appropriations package in future years.  We'd estimated that we may need $25 billion for the security at the southern border.  The President may have here as much as $8 billion, some of which is going to be challenged in court for years.</p><p>Unfortunately, I think with Democrats in control of the House, I don't think they will offer any sort of an appropriations package that allows the President to use these emergency funds in the future, very similar to what we do with, you know, not allowing the federal government -- we restrict the federal government from using any funds for abortions with the Hyde Amendment.</p><p>My suspicion is there will be an amendment on every appropriation bill from this point forward that the President sees that will restrict his use of funds for anything at the border.  And that's very unfortunate.</p><p>I had hoped that we'd be able to resolve that before that came to play.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator -- it's good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ROUNDS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Mike Rounds joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, this -- a deadly and historic blizzard bringing hurricane force winds to the central country.  Take a look at that.</p><p>This tractor trailer in Texas completely flipped over.  More than 1,000 flights were canceled at Denver's airport.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center now.  Janice -- good morning.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Maria -- one for the record books.  A hundred-mile-per-hour gusts in Texas, 80-mile-per-hour gusts in Denver, Colorado.  This was like a winter hurricane across the central plains.  Different dynamics obviously than a hurricane but the same sort of scope and power.</p><p>And we still have blizzard warnings for parts of the Rockies, the Northern Plains.  Flooding imminent ahead of this system with several inches of rainfall.  We had tornadoes yesterday, all part of the same system.</p><p>The threat for tornadic activity from the Great Lakes down towards the Southern Plains.  Again, the blizzard conditions will be ongoing across portions of the Northern Plains, through the upper Midwest.  We have wind gusts still at 50 and 60 miles per hour; parts of Nebraska, up towards the upper Midwest.</p><p>The low will move into Canada but again, we're still dealing with the threat for not only strong winds but blizzard conditions.  We had over a foot of snow, 45 inches of snow in the Colorado Rockies from this system, Maria.  And the potential again for severe storms and flooding.</p><p>The flooding potential will be imminent because we have a lot of ice jams going on and water just over-topping some of the rivers and streams across portions of the upper Midwest and the Ohio Valley.</p><p>This one is for the record books, Maria -- the great blizzard, March 2019 will go down in some of the meteorology textbooks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>DEAN:  Incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Janice -- thank you.</p><p>DEAN:  You've got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Janice Dean.</p><p>Coming up, Gary Cohn is sounding off.  The former economic adviser to the President commenting on President Trump's desire for a trade deal with China.  We'll bring you his comments next.</p><p>And then investing in Uber -- SoftBank considering putting a billion dollars in the ride-sharing company, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are lower this morning.  Futures indicating a decline of about 50 points on the Dow Industrials, 3 points lower on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq down 2 points.  This is off of the lows of the morning.</p><p>But investors are waiting on a deal between the U.S. and China.  And there's some tensions around that.  A new report says that the U.S. and China are pushing back a meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to at least April of this year.</p><p>Meanwhile Gary Cohn, former economic advisor to President Trump, spoke out on a deal with China in a new interview.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY COHN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  I think the U.S. is desperate right now for an agreement.</p><p>STEPHEN DUBNER, FREAKONOMICS:  An agreement or a headline?</p><p>COHN:  The President needs a win.  The only big open issue right now that he could claim as a big win that you hope would have a big impact on the stock market would be a Chinese resolution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Vested chief economist Milton Ezrati.  Milton -- good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MILTON EZRATI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VESTED:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've seen the Chinese economy see a real impact from this uncertainty over a U.S.-China deal.  What are you expecting here?</p><p>EZRATI:  Well, I think the Chinese are going to sign a deal.  Their economy has suffered tremendously, not just from the tariffs.  There's a natural slowdown.  It's not the developing economy it was.</p><p>A lot of industry is leaving China, not just to avoid the tariffs but also they're leaving because the wages there have gone up more than in neighboring countries -- Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia.</p><p>So China -- this has come at a bad point for China.  They have to make a deal.  They need us more than we need them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The last thing China wants is unrest in the streets, right -- Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  That's right.  The whole deal with the communist regime is they deliver the goods so you put up with the regime's suppression as long as you have the freedom to get rich.  And now we know China's been faking their economic statistics or rather inflating them, maybe they're getting -- have that college scandal bug in them.</p><p>But anyway, nobody believes those numbers anymore and they've got to deliver and they haven't been able to deliver.</p><p>EZRATI:  Yes.  I think it's noteworthy in this respect on China, if you go back to 2008, the recession of '08 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>EZRATI:  -- the whole globe was in recession.  The Chinese don't have much of a social safety net.  They laid people off and literally there were party members --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FORBES:  It's amazing how China does the GDP.  They would have the goal -- this is the goal for the GDP and they tell local governments -- you know, government spends, crazy way we do GDP is that government spends.  That counts as plus on GDP.</p><p>So they would tell these local governments, spend to make sure we reach that 8 percent target, 9 percent target -- whatever it was.  So it's really since 2008 especially, a false boom.  It's not from free market forces at work.  It's directed from the top.  That's why you have this massive borrowing in China, to try to inflate those GDP numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fascinating.</p><p>What about the U.S.?  How do you see the economy here?</p><p>EZRATI:  I think the U.S. Economy is slowing now.  But I don't think it's going to be a lasting thing.  I actually think it will pick up in the second half of the year.  And the consumers spent a little ahead of income growth last year.  He and she are pulling in their horn.  That's the first quarter this year, maybe into the spring.</p><p>Capital spending which had done very well in '17, '18, slowed in the last part of last year.  It's beginning to pick up already.  Housing seems to have stabilized.  It was off.  So I think we'll see stronger growth in the second half of the year.</p><p>FORBES:  But it depends on a China deal.</p><p>EZRATI:  Yes, it depends on a China deal.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Were you surprised that Gary Cohn said that U.S. was desperate for a deal.  I mean to me, that interview seemed somewhat personal.  He was hitting the barrel -- some of his former colleagues at the White House, which is a little surprising to me.  I don't know if he was settling scores or if he actually believes that we're desperate for a deal.</p><p>EZRATI:  I think he believes we're getting a deal.  I don't know what motivates the man.  And I don't think I ever will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about tax concerns.  Minnesota residents are reportedly buying up muni bonds to reduce their tax burden.  The state has the fourth highest state income tax rate in the U.S.  That was at 9.85 percent, according to Turbo Tax.</p><p>So Milton -- it's not just the northeast that's dealing with the fallout of high rates.  You're seeing a massive exodus in some of the high tax states in the U.S.</p><p>EZRATI:  Well, it is.  I mean this deal has effectively turned the public -- if they don't like the taxes now, they have no reprieve except to either leave or go to their state capital and say stop this.  Those are their only options.</p><p>They used to be able to effectively socialize the taxes by spreading it out through the rest of the country.  That's gone now.</p><p>New York is suffering that.  That's another problem for the city, New York state and obviously all the high tax states.</p><p>FORBES:  Do you think Albany and New York City, Gracie Mansion realize how precarious New York's position is especially in the city?</p><p>I mean I'm old enough to remember the mid-1970s.  Are we going to have a repeat of that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can New York go bankrupt?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  Can New York go bankrupt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that the issue?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  That's what I'm asking.</p><p>EZRATI:  That's right.  The state arranged the bill pay for the city effectively and cut the credit cards in half.  And it could happen again.  I don't think it's going to happen if and until we have a recession.</p><p>But the city -- this is the best of times for New York City.  Unemployment is low.  The market remains relatively buoyant.  Everything is right for the city and they're still running a deficit.  They call it a gap.  It's a deficit of almost $4 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor Cuomo understands what's going on in the state, though, because of the revenue shortfall that's really putting a squeeze on the state's budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $2 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then when you see 25,000 jobs that were heading into New York city from Amazon just disappear overnight because of some 20-something congresswoman who doesn't understand how the unemployment rate is even calculated, that sends shivers through the spines of politicians, whether they're right or left.</p><p>EZRATI:  Well, I think Cuomo knows.  And I think he realizes his back's against the wall.  I can' answer for de Blasio.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is he going to do.  What is Governor Cuomo going to do?  If his back is up against the wall and you've got all of this, you know, uncertainty and concern over taxes, will he actually lower taxes?</p><p>EZRATI:  Oh, I don't think he's going to lower taxes.  I think his first move is to try to cut spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And do more deals with technology companies?  Google is huge, huge employer in New York City and growing.  They're just not going to publicize any kind of deals that they make with these corporations.  They're going to say keep it on the  QT, we're not going to make some big marketing splash with it.  Otherwise, you know who will be tweeting about it, tweeting idiocy which I know what we're going to talk about with Karl Rove.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Karl Rove's out with a good op-ed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The New Deal was racist.  That's her -- that was her latest thing down at South by Southwest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll talk about that.</p><p>Milton -- thank you so much.</p><p>EZRATI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Milton Ezrati there.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted, here's what he said.  \"My administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale trade deal with the United Kingdom, the potential is unlimited.\"</p><p>Once the President gets beyond China it's Europe that he's going to focus on and obviously U.K. is priority there.

Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke officially announcing his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), FORMER CONGRESSMAN, TEXAS:  Amy and I are happy to share with you that I'm running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America.  This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is former Arkansas governor and former Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good so you this morning.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER GOVERNOR, ARKANSAS:  Well, good morning, Maria, great to be with you.  You know, Beto is off to an interesting start.  I would say a couple of observations.  Number one, from a production standpoint, his opening video was about seven minutes too long for a single shot.  You know, and I'm just looking at it strictly from a production standpoint.  His wife was holding his left hand.  She should have been holding both of them, because his right was overly animated for a tight shot.  So that's the production value.</p><p>Now, here's the one to the Republicans, don't take this guy lightly.  I believe people will do that at their own peril.  He's very attractive candidate from the standpoint that he's got charisma and we can make fun of him and saying he's the skateboard candidate, he's all of those things.  But he's articulate, he's good looking, he has a catchy name.</p><p>And I don't know if people remember back in 2008, but there was a guy who had been a really non-descript state senator in Illinois, that had never accomplished anything or passed a single bill, was pretty much a non-player in the U.S. Senate but he made a great speech one time at the Democratic convention and he went on to defeat the heir apparent, Hillary Clinton and became president for eight years.  So, to Republicans who say, don't worry about this.  I'd say Democrats have a history of reaching out and picking a guy that nobody thought had a shot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way, where did the name Beto come from?  Karl Rove in his op-ed this morning writes that his real name is Robert Francis.  So, we're going to talk to Karl Rove, coming up.  But, I'm just saying.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I mean, it's a name that he took, it has a Hispanic sound to it.  But he's basically of Irish descent.  But I mean, if you're in South Texas, saying you're Irish probably doesn't win you a lot of votes.  And if you can identify as Hispanic, I'm sure that's a better move in Texas.</p><p>But let's remember how close he came in a very blue state like Texas to becoming a senator, against an incumbent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That was pretty impressive to be honest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You say Texas is a blue state.  Not yet.  Governor, you said Texas was a --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, I'm sorry, red state.  It's early in the morning where I am, Dagen, you've got to remember.  I've just not had enough coffee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's looking purple more and more, right?  It's looking purple more and more by the way but --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's a red state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a red state so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman (INAUDIBLE) is from one of the border communities in Texas.  And then to quote the rider in Texas, Skip Hollandsworth, you've got the People's Republic of Austin.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, Austin, their city motto is to keep Austin weird.  They do a darn good job of it.  It's an anomaly in the state of Texas.  If you've been to Texas, you go all over the state and it's a very conservative state, people wear cowboy boots and they still have manure on the bottom of them.  If you go to Austin, it's a pretty tony type of environment and the politics of Austin very left of center.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  We won't get into jokes about manure in Texas and politicians.  But what is the compelling story about O'Rourke?  I mean, Obama, quite obvious.  What's O'Rourke other than he's a good looking guy?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I don't think he's good looking for the record.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, look, let me just say, before you answer that -- before you answer that, the media is on-board with Beto, OK.  So O'Rourke spoke to Vanity Fair yesterday.  There's a big cover story, it's titled Beto O'Rourke, I'm just born to do this.  He takes on the question of diversity in the 2020 election, saying this, I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our president has been a white man and they want something different for this country and I think that's a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision.</p><p>So governor, let's -- I don't get that quote by the way at all.  But what about Steve's question, what is it about Beto other than the superficial idea that maybe he looks like a candidate and he's got a fun name?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, you know, to go back to the old movie that all of us saw years ago, the candidate, with Robert Redford.  There was a lack of substance but there was an enormous level of charisma.  And in these television days, charisma counts.  And I think he doesn't bring a great resume.  He was a brief time congressman.  He has no major accomplishments in terms of his legislative career.</p><p>But the point is, he does light up the stage.  And there's a connection that he has with younger voters, whoever the Democrat nominee is, remember the main thing they're going to bring to the race is I'm not Donald Trump.</p><p>Now, I don't think that that's enough.  And I think when it comes down to it, the Democrats are going to over-play their hand so far to the left that even some Democrats, the more moderate ones.</p><p>FORBES:  Quick question on that, you may be right governor about going so far left.  What does that mean for Howard Schultz?  Could he become an effect de facto Democrat nominee at least for the moderates of the party?  How do you see that playing out?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, he won't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think he'll go on the Democrat side?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't because -- no, de facto.  I mean, he'll be as an Independent but he will --</p><p>FORBES:  He might do it but --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- of Democrat votes.</p><p>FORBES:  But he's too pragmatic for today's Democratic party.  He just doesn't fit their mold.  They want someone --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He won't get the nomination.</p><p>FORBES:  But could he running as an independent, would he attract a lot of Democrats who consider him the real Democrat, not the far left loony that the Democrats are likely to nominate.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  If he runs as an independent, Steve, I think that's very possible.  And in fact, if I were Donald Trump, I'd pay Howard Schultz's filing fee and make sure he gets in the race because he would be a big, big plus for the re-election of President Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, just really quickly, the most important thing about Beto O'Rourke is his fund raising ability.  He spent a record smashing $78 million and almost beat Ted Cruz in the state of Texas and a lot of that money -- this is according to Open Secrets, 48 percent, almost $21.4 million of the itemized individual contributions coded for gender came in from chicks, from females.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's really an important point that you're making, you're right, he's a master.  But the Democrats are in general.  Look at Nancy Pelosi.  But that's the point, I think that's the point you're making.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Biden history -- Joe Biden has historically not been good at fund raising.  It was one of the reasons that some people even discouraged him from trying to take on Hillary Clinton because he did not have the money, despite having the support of president Obama and people in the White House, he does not have the fund raising chops that even a Beto O'Rourke does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to get to college admissions in a second, governor.  But do you think that the -- do you think that the ticket could be Beto, Biden?  I don't see either of them wanting the V.P. spot but --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No.  I think you've got two alpha males --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  See, initially I thought it was going to be Biden president --</p><p>FORBES:  That's a nice name, B and B.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I thought initially it would be the president -- you know, the president going -- Beto going for president and -- I'm sorry, Biden going for president and Beto going for V.P. but he doesn't want V.P.  So, I don't know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, everybody says that you know, the classic answer is nobody ever wants to be V.P. but nobody's ever turned it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So, there you go.  I mean, you know, it's one of those things that nobody ever says I'm running for president because I really love to be the vice president, nobody says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get -- let me get to the college admissions scandal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But then nobody turns it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to talk about this, particularly on the heels of the Elizabeth Warren news.  Actress Lori Loughlin posted a $1 million bond in Los Angeles overnight.  Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are among dozens of people as you know, facing fraud charges for allegedly paying bribes to get their daughters into college.  One voice weighing in is Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, amazing.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It's just stunning.  I mean, the notion that people thought they could keep cheating like this and build this evidently build this huge cheating network in order for the children of the rich and powerful to make it into fancy schools.  To me it's just one more example of how the rich and powerful know how to take care of their own and everybody else just gets left behind.  I think that's wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  This is like gold.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Pocahontas (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, this is -- could this be anymore rich?  I mean, Elizabeth Warren has been under fire herself for claiming that she was a Native American in her college applications and here she is calling this scandal stunning, governor.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it's different, though, if you call yourself rich and powerful and if you call yourself a Native American.  And so, what Elizabeth Warren is doing basically is she drank a gallon of gasoline and then lit a cigarette.</p><p>I've never seen anybody self-immolate like her in my life.  How on earth does she sit there with a straight face and pretend that somehow the fraud that she did to get her way through was somehow different than the fraud of these Hollywood celebrities?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's absolutely stunning but it's just indicative.  I don't think she's going very far in this race.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we only have a couple seconds left you guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's because she sounds like -- her biggest problem is, she sounds like Hillary Clinton.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  The real news would have been if she came out in favor of cheating in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  Governor, it's good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much.  Stay with us.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new crackdown on e-cigarettes.  Cheryl Casone on headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The FDA announcing a plan to ban convenience stores and gas stations from selling flavored e-cigarettes which are popular among teens.  The agency wants to slow a surge in teenage use of these nicotine devices.  And they also are working to mandate third party identity verification and prevent bulk sales for online distribution.  The restriction is now open for public comment for the next 30 days.</p><p>Well, SoftBank and some other investors reportedly kicking the tires of Uber's self-driving car unit.  Wall Street Journal says the group may invest $1 billion or more in the operation.  Sources say a deal could come maybe next month.  The cash infusion would also help Uber attract investors ahead of its highly anticipated IPO.</p><p>Well, despite the turmoil in Britain over leaving the European Union, a 6-year-old girl there has written a very touching letter to the head of the European Council, Donald Tusk.  Sophie wrote this, dear Mr. Tusk, I live in Britain.  I know we are leaving the E.U. but I think we should be friends.  Tusk posted the letter on his Instagram page.  And then he says, quote, we'll always be friends Sophie, little heart there.  That letter was then reposted on Twitter by Parliament's Brexit coordinator who said, quote, sometimes it takes a child to put everything into perspective.  What a terrible waste Brexit is.  So they didn't exactly politicize it but they kind of did at the end but good for Sophie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, choosing your own plane model.  Travel website Kayak is adding a new feature, giving customers more control.  The story up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With the official grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane, some travel websites are giving airline passengers more options when they book their flight so they will feel safe in the sky.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.  Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  It's all about the perception of safety, how do we let the flying public know that they have some control over the type of aircraft that they're on?  So, Kayak as well as TripAdvisor are updating later this week their search engines and the criteria.</p><p>So, right now, you can search for the price, the itinerary that the flight quality, you know, if you're going to take you're right eye.  And even the aircraft in terms of is it a wide body, a regional or a narrow body.  But later this week, the specific plane will be one of these options.</p><p>You know, we have to look at as we talk about this grounding of the 737 Max 8 and 9, how many are even out there and the answer is not a lot.  72 of these jets are flown right here in the United States.  Two, three percent, that's it, of all daily flights.  Of course, many more are on order, about 5,011 on order but that's it.  That's what's flying in the U.S. right now.  If we look at the three American carriers that do fly this plane, look, you can see there, southwest is the biggest.  They have 150 flights a day.</p><p>So, this is all going to be taken out of circulation.  And you have to ask yourself, what is the cost of this to Boeing, to the airlines and to you, the traveler?  Ensure my trip in insurance company.  They've seen a big uptick in people calling.  And some agents are warning.  Look, if you take flights out of circulation, you might see air fare go up, but the numbers are still very small.  I think the bigger concern and this is something we heard for the first time from the Norwegian Air CEO, asking Boeing to pay the price.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BJORN KJOS, CEO, NORWEGIAN:  They will not (AUDIO GAP) the cost related to the new aircraft that we have park temporarily.  We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Bam.  Can Boeing afford all this?  We've got $7 billion in cash at hand, $101 billion in annual revenue but this is -- Norwegian has 18 parked, 737 Maxes right now and many other carriers as well.  So what is the reputational cost of all of this to Boeing?</p><p>FORBES:  Opening for China which wants to break into that business.  No coincidence there, the first out of the box saying no Maxes in our country, grounding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>FORBES:  And what about the lawyers?  We haven't even gotten to the lawyer costs on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be a lot of lawsuits.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, court costs.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Dreamliner when that was grounded, Boeing escaped that pretty successfully a few years ago.  They did bear, I think it was a $30 billion cost.  They did get out of that.  But yes, this one --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I felt that when it came to the downing the Dreamliners because of the batteries.  Just from a P.R. perspective, I thought they handled it much better.  And this, they are sort of like nothing to see here and then 150 people are dead.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right, and then also, what does it say about the reputation of our FAA or at -- I'm sorry or FAA?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Absolutely.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And we used to be the authority that the other countries or at least the flying public looked to make these decisions.  And we were the last ones to say we're not -- we're not grounding this plane.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, we've got a Department of Transportation quite frankly with the Secretary Elaine Chao that's a mess.  We have -- and we don't have a permanent head of the FAA.  They have not ruled on the -- like the flight delays, there are fines that the airlines have not been paying.  Again, rather than -- (INAUDIBLE) but they need to get on the ball in terms of protecting travelers in this country, not just about Boeing but in other ways.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why --</p><p>FORBES:  Let's keep in mind, still the safest form of travel.  Let's not lose sight of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>Still ahead, Facebook is under investigation.

President Trump has announced that he's keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked as new reports say the Ethiopian Airlines crash show similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.</p><p>Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation.  At the center of that probe, the social media giant's data deals with technology companies.

That's well off of the lows of the morning.  The S&amp;P is down two and the NASDAQ is now slipped into positive territory, it is up four points.  This after a wild day yesterday on Wall Street when all was set and done the major indices finished strong up 148 points on the Dow industrials yesterday, two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P was up 19, the NASDAQ was up 52.

And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman, former Republican Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes, and national security analyst, Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.</p><p>FORBES:  Lot of news, especially on the college front.  This big overhang is still China.  Where we get that trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  We haven't heard when this meeting is between President Trump and Xi Jinping.  Now the President says they're pushing it off until April.</p><p>FORBES:  And you have to wonder, does this mean they're close to a deal but they're trying to get last-minute concessions and they're planning to seek --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or not close at all.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think you hit the nail on the head earlier, Steve.  It's all about enforcement, right?  What is he going to -- we talked about this on the show just a few weeks ago.  What is Xi going to say to Trump that he didn't already promise in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama?  How do we hold their feet to the fire?  How do we enforce these things?  That's what's crucial for me for this deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the U.S. wants to be able to put tariffs back in place, should the Chinese not follow through on their promises.  The Chinese say well, then we want that as well.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  The Chinese are never going to agree to that.  But the key thing is not just the enforcement mechanism.  It's the ability or the willingness of the United States to enforce agreements.  We haven't done it consistently in the past.  That's why this Huawei thing is so important.  We are now going to do it in the future.  I think that weighs more than any mechanism.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And I will quickly point to a great, what they call in journalism, a tick-tock in the Wall Street Journal about this college cheating scandal.  And it all started with one guy, a financial executive who was being pursued on securities fraud charges and he told investigators, oh, I got something much bigger for you.  And he pointed to the Yale Soccer coach wore a wire, meeting with him in Boston, who asked the individual, this coach asked for a $450,000 payout to get a kid into Yale and there, the ball started rolling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was surveillance, phones being tapped of the mastermind, Rick Singer.  He was recording conversations.  He tried to tip off about half a dozen of the families that he was wearing a wire and that they ought to be careful but again, 33 parents charged so far.  Lori Loughlin out on -- a million dollars bail is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So he was trying to get his securities issues lessened.  He was under securities investigation and that's how he did it.  By saying look over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People with money can be very, very stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Meanwhile, the U.S. is grounding the entire Boeing 737 Max fleet after the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  Jeff flock is covering the story.  He's live at O'Hare International Airport this morning in Chicago.  Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  One-two punch to air travelers today.  Both the storm canceling flights as well as the grounding of those aircraft, the 737 Maxes.  Take a look at the board at O'Hare.  If you see yellow or red, that means your flight is either canceled or delayed.  The grounding of the 737s announced by the President yesterday.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.  All of those planes are grounded effective immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  Latest on the investigation, one, the black box now to France to be analyzed but as you reported earlier, Maria, similarities in the two crashes.  That leading the FAA to say we better shut it all down.  People being rebooked now but as we said, some of the flights canceled.  Now, as you reported also, a fairly small number of planes in the air that are 737 Maxes or at least were in the air.  Southwest, the biggest among them.</p><p>But if you look at the overall fleet, take a look at those numbers, the overall U.S. Air fleet is about 7,000 or more aircraft.  The number grounded, less than 70.  You can do the math on that.  It's less than one percent.  We have the latest number of delays and cancellations and I would say the Lion's share of these are as a result of the so-called bomb cyclone.  Don't like that term, but there you go.</p><p>490 delays and over 1,000 cancellations, the majority of those coming in Denver.  Number two on the list here in Chicago.  We're at least number two on the list.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, Jeff, thanks very much.  We'll keep following that.  Jeff Flock in Chicago this morning.  I want to turn to the race for 2020 now.  Beto O'Rourke has thrown his hat in the ring officially for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D) TEXAS:  This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.  The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate have never been greater.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Fox News Contributor, Karl Rove.  Karl, great to see you.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  How are you, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm great.  Want to get to your op-ed on AOC in a second.  But first, your reaction to Beto announcing his bid.</p><p>ROVE:  Am I the only one who thinks it's ironic that he sort of makes his announcement in a long interview in a magazine with vanity in its title?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROVE:  Look, it was revealing -- it was a revealing interview, though.  He said you know what, I never prepare my speeches which is why he said he's a reckless guy as a result.  So that's what led him to say I don't think there's nothing more American than taking a knee, law enforcement is the Jim -- new Jim Crow-ism.  We heard him recently in El Paso say, yes, I'm in favor of tearing down all the fences and borders between us and Mexico.</p><p>It's why when he went out to campaign in Texas in 2017 and '18 and went to all 254 counties, he would go to these small towns and give a speech to the local group of Democrats and routinely drop the F-bomb.  And that was OK, I guess, for the hip parts of Dallas and Austin and Houston, but when you're out in Friona or Jacksonville or Cuero, those people are church-going people even if they're Democrats and by god, you don't use the F-bomb in front of polite people.  I mean, he's a little bit reckless.</p><p>FORBES:  So what's the attraction, Karl?  Other than he's a pretty boy and nearly beat Ted Cruz, who had his own popularity issues in Texas?  What's the fascination with this guy?  Should we take him seriously?</p><p>ROVE:  Well, -- Steve, glad you asked.  I've got a white board here.  Some -- for the interview as well.  For the interview as well.  You can't -- he said, you know, you can't hide from whom you are.  And he's right.  And he's got charisma and natural authenticity and a comfort level about being around people and being in the public arena and that will be helpful to him.  He talks in the article about how he is more enthused about talking about what he is for than what he is against.</p><p>And I think it's going to be an important element in the 2020 campaign for any Democrat.  He said I got to have a campaign that looks like America.  He realizes that he's a white guy so he's going to have a campaign and pledges an administration that looks like America.  So we're going to see a lot of -- a lot of women and we're going to see a lot of people of color in his campaign.  He says, I will work with republicans.  I did it when I was in Congress.</p><p>I will do it as President which is going to be unique.  Is Elizabeth Warren going to say, Bernie Sanders going to say, Kamala Harris going to say, oh, I'm going to work with Republicans?  And then remember, he raised $80 million for a Senate race.  The question is how many of those donors are going to stick with him.  But that's a big starting point that makes it -- makes it possible for him to be competitive.  The real question's going to be what's the message?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ROVE:  And we've got a little bit of a sense of it.  It's like hope and optimism, we're a great country, we faced big challenges but we can overcome them.  We'll see how this goes.  The big challenge for him is going to be his Senate race where he got close to Ted Cruz is not going to be like the Presidential race because Ted Cruz ignored him.  He gave him 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 and virtually all of 2018 to go out there and be by himself projecting a message to the voters and only in late September and October did Cruz engage with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, really?  OK.</p><p>ROVE:  He's going to be engaged with right away by a bunch of Democrats.  We'll see how he handles it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Karl, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>ROVE:  Dagen?  Of course it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Here's Beto O'Rourke,\" the challenges we face are the greatest in living memory.  OK.  Not the Great Depression, not Pearl Harbor, not World War II, not the Cold War, not the Cuban Missile Crisis, not the 70s with the Sky High guest, not 9/11, not the 2008 financial crisis.  Down south we say don't spit in my face and tell me it's raining.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes, yes.  This is going to be a problem for all the Democrats of hyperventilating about how bad the country is but remember that helps them inside their party.  There are -- there are -- the core of the Democratic base does believe the biggest threat we have faced in our lifetimes is the presence of Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office.  This is I think Robert Francis O'Rourke's attempt to negotiate around this.</p><p>And look, please, let's not refer to him by the fake name -- nickname that he did not use at Woodbury Forest, that he did not use at Colombia, that he did not use as an adult when he was -- when he was in a grunge band but only started to reemphasize when he ran for the city council in a heavily Latino town, El Paso, Texas.  Let's please refer to him by the name that he appears on the ballot as Robert Francis O'Rourke.  Please.  Let's do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, wait, wait.  He went to Woodbury?  Well, that's an elitist private school in Orange, Virginia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's that about?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>ROVE:  Well, he was there -- he was there when it was not co-ed.  So -- and he went to Colombia.  As I remember, that's sort of a private elite institution on the upper west side of New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he just started using it when he ran for office.  That's interesting because I was just asking the panel about Beto and Robert Francis and why now we're calling him Beto.  I mean, he's Irish, right?</p><p>ROVE:  Well, he's Robert Francis O'Rourke.  Yes.  And look, if you want a want a nickname, let's give him what his name represents RFOR.  Robert Francis O'Rourke.  RFOR.  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Karl, before you go, you got to talk to us about your op-ed this morning in the Journal.  American history as told by AOC.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  I listened to her speech here in Austin at south by southwest and it is jaw-dropping.  Look, of course, we were going to have her and the moderator immediately say Donald J. Trump is a racist but Ronald Reagan is a racist and why, because he talked about a woman who bilked welfare in the 70s out of $150,000 and he called her -- he didn't call her welfare queen.  Others did.</p><p>But AOC says well, that was racist.  Well, the woman was white.  Please tell me what's racist about that.  And then FDR --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about the new deal?  The new deal too.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  The new deal was racist because it expanded, it legit -- it literally gave mortgage relief to white people but not to black people and as a result, the housing gap, the wealth gap grew because of the racist policies of Franklin Roosevelt.  Well, first of all, it is not borne out by the facts.  The Home Owners' Loan Corporation did not expand the difference between home ownership between blacks and whites.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROVE:  And it's just jaw-dropping.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she said it does not -- it does not feel good to live in America today.  I mean, what in the world are these people living in?</p><p>ROVE:  Exactly.  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The America is the highlight of the world.  I mean, particularly now, where you've got this economy that is -- that is firing on all cylinders.</p><p>FORBES:  You know, we're raising money here to give her a ticket to Venezuela.</p><p>ROVE:  Well, you know what, that private charity is wrong.  The government should pay for the ticket to Venezuela.  Please.  Private charity is bad.  It's -- that's merely an expression of the wealthy who have been stealing the money from -- what I loved was she was talking about ordinary people, ordinary working people and her audience had to pay between $1300 and $1600 for their tickets that allowed her to go -- that allowed them to go in. They had all access premium passes in order to go see AOC.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they did and she had a packed house.  Karl, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much.  Karl Rove.</p><p>ROVE:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great op-ed.  Coming up, trouble for Facebook.  The social media giant reportedly facing a criminal investigation now for handing over user data to major tech companies without permission.  The fallout, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Deadly blizzard conditions in Colorado and across the country this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, it's been something else.  Good morning again.  Nearly 3100 flights canceled over two days, most of them at Denver International after a bomb cyclone hit the airport there.  Wind gusts as strong as 80 miles per hour.  Now, the Colorado police officer -- elsewhere in Colorado, a police officer hit and killed while outside his vehicle helping with the car that had skidded off of Interstate 76.</p><p>Now, let's go to Texas.  Small planes overturned in the municipal airport by high winds.  They looked like toys.  Strong winds also a major problem in New Mexico, sweeping a train right off of the tracks.  And then there is some stunning video out of Texas.  Look at this.  Strong winds blowing over a tractor trailer.  And this wasn't the only one.  There's been reports of wind speeds up to 70 miles per hour, causing multiple trucks to blow over.  No word, folks, of the condition of this driver, if he's OK or not.  But wow, something else.</p><p>OK.  Shares of General Electric lower in the premarket.  They're forecasting adjusted earnings between 50 and 60 cents per share this year.  That is below analyst expectations of around 70 cents.  G.E. also says its industrial operations could burn about two billion more cash than they generated in 2018.  There is the stock, actually it's higher in the premarket, 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>And then there is this.  Next year's Major League Home Run Derby winner is going to reportedly get a nice little bonus, $1 million.  That is according to the new agreement between the MLB and the players association.  Other changes coming to the league include a single trade deadline and a three batter minimum for pitchers.  All that starts in 2020.  And those are your headlines, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Coming up, Facebook is under fire this morning.  The technology giant reportedly now under criminal investigation for the company sharing user data with more than 150 of the largest technology companies out there without permission.</p><p>Then game on.  E.A. games reportedly paying the world's most followed gamer $1 million to play and promote the launch of Apex legends.  The big business of gaming, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook is under fire once again.  The company reportedly facing a criminal investigation over controversial data sharing deals with technology giants including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft.  Now, Facebook reportedly gave access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of its users to those tech companies.  This after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram and WhatApp across the globe yesterday.</p><p>Joining us right now is former prosecutor and criminal defense attorney at the Bianchi Law Group, David Bruno.  David, good to have you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, PARTNER, THE BIANCHI LAW GROUP:  Good morning.  And thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the Facebook news.</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes.  This is -- the information comes from the New York Times through unnamed sources so let's start there.  But if there's a grand jury investigation out of the district, it's criminal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  It's criminal.  This is unrelated to any of the administrative action, unrelated to the consent order, unrelated to Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are the implications of a criminal investigation for Facebook?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, the grand jury subpoenas mean nothing, right?  Because when we talk about criminal, you got to talk about presumption of innocence.  Even for somebody that's charged, there's a presumption of innocence.  And there's even more caution when it's just a grand jury subpoena.  So in the event that crimes have been violated, it could be the corporation generally, could be individual officers, could be board members.  You know, it's limitless when you talk about criminal law.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's not just this investigation.  This is in the Eastern district of New York.  There's also a securities fraud investigation going on within the Justice Department in the Northern District of California related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  There's the FTC looking into its behavior, did it basically violate a consent agreement that it signed in 2011 over again, shared data that deceived customers and consumers.</p><p>And then also, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into their behavior.  And what's going on is they keep saying that they're fixing problems, we're not doing this, and it turns up time and time again that they're not being quite frankly honest with the American people and regulators.</p><p>BRUNO:  Great point.  Especially on the consent order.  Because they had problems releasing consumer data before the consent order in 2011.  That's why there's a consent order.  And they agreed not to release without the consent of the consumers.  So the Cambridge Analytica issue is a potential violation and they're still looking at that.  Like you said, that's the California stuff.  But it's interesting because New York is different.  I think the New York investigation is completely different than Cambridge Analytica, which could sign -- be a sign for problems for safety.</p><p>FORBES:  So what exactly in New York is the crime they think?</p><p>BRUNO:  Even Times article itself says we don't know.  We don't know how long it's been open and we don't know what the scope is.  All they know is that these two unnamed cell phone companies received grand jury subpoenas.  That's going to be subpoena duces tecum for records.  So they're probably looking at the agreement between Facebook and the cell phone companies as well as any data that was received in exchange between the two.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  This is totally separate from Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the big tech companies but it certainly adds, you know, more political pressure and more weight to her proposal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll break up?  They will be forced to break up?</p><p>BRUNO:  I was talking about this in the morning show a couple days ago.  I think ultimately, yes.  But right now, no.  It would be under the antitrust laws.  They could -- they could proceed under those laws or through new laws by Congress.  That would potentially be something that could affect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congress will start by putting up roadblocks to additional acquisitions by these companies.  Again, buying up the smaller companies and essentially buying them up and then shutting them down just to own and sit on top of technology that might be valuable and increase their market share.  That would be the first step.  It won't be breaking a lot.</p><p>BRUNO:  When is Congress going to act?  This was in the forefront last year when we were talking about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, they got --</p><p>BREAM:  This is a completely different --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They got many of the CEOs to come down and testify --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes, exactly.  Zuckerberg himself testified last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  David Bruno there.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Tesla is gearing up for a big reveal.  The company will unveil its Model Y SUV later today.  We will tell you what to expect when we come back.</p><p>And then the college cheat scheme.  Actress Lori Loughlin posted a million dollars in bond after appearing in Federal court yesterday while her daughter was reportedly onboard the yacht of the chairman of the USC's board of trustees.  When the scandal actually broke, the outrage coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 14th.  Your top stories right now, 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news, we're getting readings on initial Jobless Claims and Import/Export Prices.  You'll see it on the screen momentarily.  Futures, meanwhile, off of the lows of the morning.  Dow Industrials now showing a decline of just 10 points.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged, exactly where it closed yesterday.  And the NASDAQ is up six points currently.  In Europe this morning, gains across the board, pretty much all morning this morning.  European indices look like this.  Jobless Claims coming out, 229,000 as you can see.  And the Ft-100 is up 41 points.  The CAC Quarante is up 35 points.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 39.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Shanghai was the worst performer, down 1-1/4 percent.  Pushing back on the Green New Deal, top Republicans are calling for a hearing on the controversial Green Deal from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Onto the latest on the college cheating scandal, one of the parents who was arrested, his son coming to his defense while casually smoking marijuana on the streets of New York City.  Wait until you see this.  Then pay to play, a new report says Electronic Arts paid top gamer, Ninja, $1 million to promote Apex Legends, all those stories coming up.  But first, new economic data out this morning.  We've got the Initial Jobless claims number.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at a market that is pretty much back and forth, positive and negative territory all morning.  Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  That's right, Maria.  We've been looking at these numbers.  I was just talking with a trader, that's why my attention was not on you.  Initial Jobless Claims, this is actually higher than anticipated.  So, you know, I got to tell you, we had such great news on the jobs market so far.  I'm not sure traders are going to pay a whole lot of attention to this.  As you know, it's a very volatile number week to week, the four-week moving average, 226,250.  We come in at 229,000.  It's a little higher, but not anything that's likely to move the markets here.  Import/export prices, this is a turnaround and interesting, because what we've had are import and export prices that have been declining.  Now, a turnaround, higher and higher than anticipated.  The question here, is the government actually dealing with the real numbers now after the shutdown?  They're still trying to get it together, I think.  And there could be noise in these numbers.</p><p>We're going to talk quickly about Tesla here.  They're coming out tonight with a Crossover SUV.  It's going to be very big news.  The Y, they will unveil it at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 11:00 p.m. Eastern.  They're going to live stream it on their website.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  You can see the stock up here one percent.  It is the sister car of the Model 3, but 10 percent bigger, 10 percent more expensive, and slightly less range.  This is the car that everybody wants to buy, the Crossover, the small SUV, is what's really selling in this country and frankly, across the world.  It will be made at the Gigafactory in Nevada.  That's the plan right now.  But lots of questions, of course, about Tesla, how it's dealing with its debt.  Those questions continue.  That company frankly in turmoil as it prepares to roll out this new Crossover, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  Gerri Willis there on Wall Street pushing back on the Green New Deal.  Eleven house members are urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold hearings on the agenda championed by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Joining me now is Oregon Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Greg Walden.  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. GREG WALDEN (R-OR), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I've got the letter in my hand from many of you -- from you and many of your colleagues who have signed on on the bottom line here.  You're urging the chairman to put hearings on this.  Why?  What's the point?</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, we know from history that the last time this happened, Speaker Pelosi told the National Association of Counties Congress had to pass Obamacare so we can find out what's in it.  We don't want that to happen here.  Look, the American people have a right to know what's in the Green New Deal, the effect it will have on their energy prices, on climate, on jobs.  The AFL-CIO yesterday came out and said millions of workers in America would be adversely affected by the Green New Deal.  Independent think tanks have said it caused out a $93 trillion would increase your energy bills by 22 percent.</p><p>We have a right to know what the left is doing here, what the Socialist Democrats are doing here, and my fear is they're going to cram through Congress like they've done other legislation, not give due process, not give hearings, and all we're asking for is let's have a hearing on this legislation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we've been poking --</p><p>WALDEN:  Roll out your plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- holes in this plan from the get-go, on this program --</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of the cost.  As you said, $93 trillion.  And also because, well, frankly, it doesn't make any sense to do away with fossil fuels within 10 years.  We've have spoken with scientists and it's -- it can't be done basically.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think that a hearing would educate the people?  I mean the pushback that we've gotten Dagen, right, is that this is just broad strokes.  This is just an idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad strokes like let's get rid of all --</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- fossil fuels in this country.</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And livestock --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which, by the way, if --</p><p>WALDEN:  And airplanes and everything else.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And these are pretty radical broad strokes, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  This is pretty off the canvas stuff.  And there would be policy that would follow, we know that.  Look, we're open --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, let me bring Dagen in.  Let me bring Dagen in because we've both been really been poking holes in this from the get-go, Dagen.</p><p>WALDEN:  Good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It would hurt the poor in America --</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and lower income Americans more than anybody else.  We use fossil fuel, we use gasoline and natural gas because there are plentiful in the United States and inexpensive, number one.  We are not a nation, given its size, that we can get around places on light rail.  We saw the boondoggle out in California --</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which, again, has basically -- most of it has been shelved, the light rail project, the high speed trains there.  Also, we're a leader in reducing emissions on the global stage.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the world in part because of natural gas.  Emissions since 2005 have fallen 30 percent coming out of electric power plants because of the use of natural gas.  So I don't -- again, did she cook this up at the bar late one night before she won her congressional seat after a little too much tequila?  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, I -- that's all spot-on.  By the way, we have a housing crisis in my state and in my district, and this would drive up the cost of housing.  You see what's happening in California with some of their radical ideas.  The Civil Liberties Union and others are suing because the impact it has on the poor to drive up the cost of housing.  Look, we have innovative ideas to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change as Republicans.  We want an opportunity to put our ideas forward.  , and to your point, by leading on energy development and discovery, by leading on innovation like battery storage, by putting forward new nuclear technologies, we can make the math add up but their math doesn't add up when you're going a hundred percent renewables in 10 years.</p><p>They want to get rid of livestock, airplanes.  My district would stretch from the Atlantic to Ohio.  There's no high speed rail going to get me home and around that district.  And livestock's our number two ag commodity in my district and they want to get rid of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to --</p><p>WALDEN:  I mean this -- none of this adds up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to be clear -- I just want to be clear about something.  I'm not making fun of this woman's job.  We've all worked at some -- at one -- at one point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- tending bar --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was the coat check girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- wait -- right.  Waiting tables.  We're not making fun of that.  But we are making -- we are calling out somebody who's has gotten a lot of attention because one, she's an attractive woman and she's young and she knows how to use social media very well and personally, as a woman, I want her to be better.  I want her to be smarter.  I don't want her to spout nonsense, things that are not true about the unemployment rate in this country.</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how, you know, how many hours a week the average American works.</p><p>WALDEN:  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just learn some facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's be clear.  Nancy Pelosi is not going to put this down for a vote.  I mean Congressman, your letter is urging the speaker to do that, but she's already locked arms with AOC.</p><p>WALDEN:  We're asking for hearings.  We're asking for hearings.  Let's take a look at it.  And what you haven't touched on is the fact the Green New Deal also includes a full government takeover of your health care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>WALDEN:  Read the data today coming out of England about wait times for cancer patients to get treatment.  They're not meeting any of their mandates, any of their goals here.  And we don't want long wait times in America and that's $32 trillion, a complete government takeover.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALDEN:  And so there -- this is much more than just climate contained in the socialist manifesto.  And I think Americans have the right to know and as members of Congress, I don't want this thing pulled up quickly and voted on without us having a chance to go through it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And that's what we're asking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a good point.</p><p>WALDEN:  Can't we just have hearings?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think you'll have the hearing?  You think you'll have hearings on all of this?</p><p>WALDEN:  I certainly hope so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  You know, the Energy and Commerce Committee has a record of bipartisan work in these matters and I think there's an opportunity we should have a hearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>WALDEN:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Greg Walden there.  Breaking news on Tesla, the company is announcing Zachary Kirkhorn the new Chief Financial Officer.  Company also naming a new Chief Accounting Officer.  This just coming out right now with these new appointments.  CFO and new accounting officer at Tesla, stock is up, better than one percent right now.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Boeing is battling a major crisis.  The U.S. has grounded all Boeing 737 Max aircrafts.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back.</p><p>Then the big business of gaming, EA Games reportedly paying the world's top gamer a million dollars to play and promote the launch of Apex Legends.  But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  The Superstars came out to play on day eight at the BNP Paribas Open.  Roger Federer continued his excellent run off form as he look for a record sixth title in the desert.  The 20-time major champion eased past Great Britain's Kyle Edmund in straight sets to punch his ticket into the elite eight.</p><p>Federer moves on to face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz for a spot in the final four.  Earlier, Rafael Nadal barely broke a sweat as he dispatched Philipp Krajinovic to reach the quarters.  The Spaniard closing out the impressive win at 6-4 after just under an hour and a half on court.  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from the California Desert on Tennis Channel.  Our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Federal Aviation Administration is grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes in the U.S.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I'm trying to put myself in the position of being an airline which has one of these Max jets on order.  After all, there are 4,000 of these jets that are on order from Boeing, so you got airlines all around the world waiting to take delivery.  Some of them are about to take delivery.  What do they do?  Here they've ordered a plane, which is now not allowed to fly.  Do they take delivery?  Do they have some kind of financial accommodation with Boeing?  And this is not going to be fixed very quickly.  The black box in the Ethiopian crash has been taken to Paris.  It was badly damaged.  They have special equipment there to get inside the thing and find out what happened.</p><p>That's going to take weeks, maybe months.  So, it's a very long time before you find out exactly what happened, what is the problem with these jets and how do you fix it.  In other words, you've got all these orders that are going out there and will the airlines take delivery?  What's going to happen? It's the great unknown and I think it's a huge negative for Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's what I got to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  huge, huge negative, for sure.  I think, Stuart, this company is down 25 billion in market value --</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- just since the Ethiopian crash.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty incredible.  We've seen an impact, we'll probably see a continued one.</p><p>VARNEY:  I have no idea the financial impact on Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  But in the immediate term, there is going to be a negative financial impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  How it works out, don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you'll have more in about 10 minutes.  Stu, we'll see you then.  Thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>First though, college cheat scheme.  Actress Lori Loughlin is posting $1 million bond after appearing in court for alleged bribery to get her daughter into an elite university.  We've got the very latest there.  And then game on, the world's top computer gamer, Ninja, reportedly making $1 million to promote the launch of Apex Legends.  The business of gaming after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More to that college admissions scandal.  Lori Loughlin released on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to face a Boston judge with Felicity Huffman on March 29th.  CEO Gregory Abbott and his wife, Marcia, also reportedly bought their daughter's way into school.  Their son, Malcolm, coming to their defense while smoking pot on the streets of New York and promoting his mixtape, saying this, \"They're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.  I believe everyone has a right to go to college, man.\"</p><p>Joining me right now, reaction, is FOX News Contributor and \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" Correspondent, Kat Timpf, Former Obama Campaign Adviser and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, Axios Markets Newsletter Author, and FOX News Contributor and National Security Analyst, Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you, guys.  Well, I mean just the idea that he's on the streets of New York smoking marijuana in the face of this, what is he thinking?</p><p>DION RABOUIN, AXIOS MARKETS NEWSLETTER AUTHOR:  That's not even a misdemeanor anymore, right?  Now in de Blasio's New York, you know, that's just like getting a traffic ticket.  So, hey, maybe his mixtape is hot, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's still --</p><p>RABOUIN:  Maybe it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- not legal in New York for --</p><p>RABOUIN:  No, no, it's not legal, but it's basically like getting a traffic ticket at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's gross.  I'm so sick of smelling weed.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN ADVISER AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I was just going to say I can't walk down the street without getting caught in a cloud of weed smoke.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean it's probably going to go -- to go legal at some point.  But the real point is it's not and this guy is sort of sticking his nose, you know, sticking his finger in the hurt by doing this.</p><p>BIRO:  Yes.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This is what happens when you have parents who will get you out of anything and everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right,</p><p>TIMPF:  And who will do anything for you.  They make you so entitled --</p><p>BIRO:  Entitlement.</p><p>TIMPF:  -- that this guy is saying, \"Oh, I'm going to be a rap star.  I bet you -- \" I mean I've not heard -- and I've not heard his CD, but I do not plan to listen to it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Mixtape.</p><p>RABOUIN:  His mixtape -- his mixtape might be hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  His mixtape --</p><p>TIMPF:  I just -- this is what happens when you're so entitled and you know your parents will get you out of anything.  This is the way that you behave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I thought --</p><p>BIRO:  I'm not buying that mixtape at the gas station.</p><p>TIMPF:  No.  I hope his parents didn't spend money on him getting into college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  They probably buy him weed.</p><p>RABOUIN:  I think they did.  I think this one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you -- do you think all the students involved are either going to be pulled out or it's too late for that?  I mean they're not going to -- they're obviously not going to let anyone in who attempted to cheat.</p><p>BIRO:  Like I said, pull them out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BIRO:  And send them to military school.  As a vet, I'm all for it.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Well, this scandal's been going on for years.  I think they tracked it back to 2011 to 2018.  So, some of these kids I think are still in college.  Some of these kids probably have their degrees already and have moved on.  Maybe they have jobs in, you know, prestigious firms.  Who knows?  Obviously some are out selling mixtapes on the street and smoking marijuana, but, you know, these kids are -- a lot of them I think have probably already graduated and moved on and really what do you do?  You can't take the degree back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder how the students did in school given the fact they did pay their way in.  Hey, how about this?  Pay for play.  Fortnite, great Tyler Blevins, known as Ninja, reportedly made $1 million for promoting the competition, Apex Legends.  So, he's being paid to promote this.</p><p>TIMPF:  What a life, to get paid for playing videogames.  Everyone else plays videogames to the detriment of their career.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that good for him, wonderful, but I don't think kids should look at this and say, \"See, mom and dad?\"</p><p>BIRO:  That's what I want to do.</p><p>TIMPF:  \"I don't got to do my homework.  I'm going to be a millionaire by playing videogames.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If it works for him.</p><p>BIRO: But hey, if Kendall Jenner can get a quarter of a million dollars for one post on Instagram to promote the Fyre Festival, why not?</p><p>RABOUIN:  And this is from the market's perspective, this was really a great thing for EA.  They were falling behind other video game makers.  Fortnite has really sucked all the air out of the videogame space and this really got EA back on top.  I think they've got about 50 million users playing this game right now, which was the biggest launch in I think a long time, at least since Fortnite's been out.  And their stock has really responded as a result, so.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm a capitalist.  I'm all for people making money, whether it's through promoting videogames, reality T.V., like, you know, whatever.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Whatever, as long as you're making money, I'm not into socialism and free everything.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, speaking of making money, listen to this.  There are now more wealthy households in the United States equivalent to the entire population of Sweden.  Last year, more than 10.2 million households saw a net worth of $1 million to $5 million breaking a new record, according to a spectrum group survey.  Pretty good stuff that you're seeing --</p><p>BIRO:  Awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- so many millionaires in the U.S. and people lift out of poverty.  That's capitalism.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Absolutely.  It's a great thing.  It's so hip to sort of demonize people for being successful, but that's not what this country is supposed to be out -- about.  I don't understand where we reached the point where successful equals bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TIMPF:  And, no, that's a great thing.  It's a wonderful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think about this whole debate about capitalism versus socialism?  Good op-ed in The Journal today by Dan Henninger, socialism, yes, be afraid.</p><p>TIMPF:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts.  Dion.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Look, I don't know that socialism is coming to America.  And, again, there are lots of different types of socialism.  There's -- you've got Bernie on the left saying he wants Democratic Socialism, which it's important to point out is very different from what's happening in Venezuela and the situation there.  You've also got places like Norway that have socialism, you've got Chile who had a socialist president.  So, what that means is there's a lot of different things.  I think a lot of people are quick to point at something and call it socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's be clear --</p><p>RABOUIN:  It's a broad spectrum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is federal -- this is a federal takeover of certain industries.  And that's what Medicare For All is.</p><p>RABOUIN:  But that's not what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what this Green New Deal is.  So, these are socialist policies.</p><p>BIRO:  I'm a little interested to see Nancy Pelosi herself pushing back on some of these.  Basically with the Green Deal she kind of said, \"Yes, that's cute,\" and just moved on.  So, as a Democrat myself I was a little but relieved because I'm scared.  I'm more of the, you know, I'm a Southern Democrat so this socialism stuff kind of scares me a little bit, honestly.</p><p>TIMPF:  There's no doubt that the polling shows that Millennials and Generation Z are more in favor of socialism than any other generation.</p><p>BIRO:  Right.</p><p>TIMPF:  I just don't think they totally understand what it is.  They think it's wearing like a Che Guevara T-shirt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  Great Millennial panel, guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it.  Kat Timpf, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, and Morgan Ortagus.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show.  Dagen, Steve, Morgan, thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Have a great day, everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.

Happy Thursday, everybody, good morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, March 14th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation now.  At the central of the probe, the social media giant's data deals with other technology companies, it comes after a major outage at Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp last night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Grounded now, President Trump is keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked as new reports say that the Ethiopian Airlines crash shows similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.  There was evidence at the scene of that Ethiopian accident which caused the President to ground these planes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A deadly and historic blizzard, bringing hurricane-force winds to the Central United States.  More than 1,000 flights canceled at Denver's airport this morning.  The storm is set to affect more than 70 million Americans.  And out on bond, actress Lori Loughlin is posting $1 million in bond after appearing in court for her alleged role in the college admission scandal -- we have the very latest.  There's a new report says that the scam was uncovered by accident.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Markets this morning are higher.  Take a look, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading this morning.  The Dow Industrials right now up 50 points, as you see, a quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 also higher by 4-1/2, and the NASDAQ up 17-1/4 points this morning.  It looks like we will see a firmer opening this morning once the market is open.</p><p>Our top story this hour, Facebook is under fire again this morning.  The company reportedly facing now a criminal investigation over controversial data-sharing deals.  This, after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp across the globe.  Dagen McDowell, good morning to you.  Dagen, what's your take?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That it's just incredible the way the story is developing and the recklessness that Facebook behaved with in terms of revealing people's data on the service.  So, this is according to the New York times, that federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation into these data-sharing deals that Facebook struck with some of the world's largest technology companies.  Again, shining an even brighter spotlight on the social media companies' business practices.</p><p>There's -- a grand jury in New York had subpoenaed records from at least two prominent makers of smart phones and other devices.  This is according to reporting in the New York Times.  These companies are among 150, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Sony, that at one point, cut data-sharing deals with Facebook.  The agreement which were originally revealed in the New York Times let these companies see users' friends, contact information, other data about individuals, sometimes without consent.</p><p>Facebook says that it's phased out most of these partnerships over the last couple of years.  This -- so this is a -- this is a grand jury of inquiry overseen by prosecutors.  This is the eastern district of New York, but let's also talk about the federal trade commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are looking into Facebook's behavior.  Also, the Justice Department's securities fraud unit has been investigating.  And this is in the northern district of California.  The situation around the Cambridge Analytica data sharing.  Remember Facebook back in -- I think it was 2011, signed a consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission because it was sharing data in ways that deceit consumers, what's the fallout from that?</p><p>Meantime, Facebook was down yesterday, also Instagram, also WhatsApp, it owns all three of those companies.  Down for at least 11 hours as of early Thursday, and the outage could force Facebook potentially to issue refunds to advertisers.  And, of course, we were all just angry as you know what, that we couldn't get on to Instagram yesterday.  Right, Maria?  Back to you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we were.  But this criminal investigation is a big story.  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed.  And again, where does it lead, and is Facebook now face -- remember, it's going to pivot its business to a more private communications.  Well, nothing is -- nothing is private if you're operating on a Facebook platform.  I think that the company has made that pretty clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because that's how they make money.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Advertising and data.  All right, Dagen, we'll keep following that.  Meanwhile, this is the big story as well, this morning, grounding the 737 Max altogether.  The United States making this decision with the Federal Aviation Administration, after finding new data linking Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash and last October's Lion Air crash.  President Trump commented on the move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED:  We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 738 Max 9, and the planes associated with that line.  Planes that are in the air will be grounded if they are the 737 Max, will be grounded upon landing at the destination.  The pilots have been notified.  Airlines have been all notified.  Airlines are agreeing with this, the safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Roman &amp; Associates founder and CEO, Anthony Roman.  Anthony, thanks very much for weighing in here.</p><p>ANTHONY ROMAN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, ROMAN &amp; ASSOCIATES:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is one of the most widely used planes across the country, right, and the world?</p><p>ROMAN:  It is becoming one of the most widely used planes.  And it's a fascinating aircraft with a 10 percent savings in fuel consumption.  That's an enormous amount of money during global operations.  It's also the best-selling aircraft in history, 5100 firm orders for Boeing.  And Boeing is set to lose $25 billion in market value.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, it's already lost 25 billion market value since the Ethiopian crash happened.  The stock is down about 10 percent.  But what about this plane, what do we need to know about this plane?  I mean, the fact that the FAA is now grounding all of the planes, travelers also are reacting to the 737's grounding.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do trust airlines.  I do understand that any aircraft or any kind of anything could have an issue at any time.  It doesn't mean everything is bad, or -- I feel pretty safe flying.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Actually, I was flying back from Daytona Beach, American Airlines today.  Did a couple of flights, and I wanted to make sure what plane I was getting on, because I've probably wouldn't have gotten on the Max.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's a known safety concern, and certainly we're putting in the effort to figure it out before anything else happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anthony, what's your take on all of this?</p><p>ROMAN:  Well, you know, pilots knew there was a problem, the FAA knew there was a problem, prior to Lion Air and immediately following Lion Air.  The FAA reported in a worthiness directive, to of Boeing to redo some of the computer code on the MCAS and auto pilot system.  That's not done unless they know there is some type of flaw in the system.  But they have not reported to the public what that flaw may have been.</p><p>There were five pilot reports to the National Safety Reporting System.  Identical problems to the Lion Air situation and similar to what we see on the satellite data in the oscillations in the takeoff phase, in Ethiopian air as well.  And these captains, seasoned U.S. carrier captains reported to NASA that there were pitch oscillations, pitched down uncommanded actions by the aircraft, auto-throttles during the takeoff phase, not being in the correct position despite the input data placed in the computers by the pilot are verified to be correct.  So, all sorts of problems with this aircraft.</p><p>The issue is, these airplanes are much more complicated than airplanes in the early 2000s, the 90s, and the 80s.  These are highly-computerized machines, so not only are we dealing with more complexity in engines and systems, but now hundreds, if not millions of lines of code in these computer systems that have to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Because after the Lion Air crash, the CEO of Boeing told us that there were -- there was an issue that needed -- the pilots needed to be updated about, that the plane was upgraded, there was a change in some of the operations, the pilot needed to be aware of those.  Is there -- is it beyond that that the pilots just need to be educated about this plane, or is it something bigger than that?</p><p>ROMAN:  Well, usually, accident phases are a combination of issues.  And the pilot, the lack of pilot awareness that this system was operating in the background, and the lack of pilot training to overcome, to recognize and overcome any anomalies in this system is just a failure.  Basically, it had to be a cost-savings failure, because training time costs money, and the aviation industry is constantly trying, like all businesses, to drive its cost down.  Not the best way to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we'll be watching this.  Obviously, a major impact to Boeing, but the safety of Americans is the administrations show its concern so they grounded all of them.  Anthony, thanks very much for weighing in.  Appreciate it very much.  Anthony Roman joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, as you saw on the screen, Beto O'Rourke officially announcing his 2020 Presidential bid.  We're going to talk about that this morning.  And then there's this, deadly blizzard conditions in Colorado and across the country this morning.  Cheryl Casone with all of that in headlines.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria, good morning.  Nearly 1400 flights canceled at Denver International after a bomb cyclone hit the airport there.  Look at these pictures, wind gusts as strong as 80 miles an hour.  Elsewhere in Colorado, a police officer hit and killed while outside his vehicle, helping with the car that had skidded off of Interstate 76.  Now, to Texas, small planes overturned like toys at a municipal airport by high winds.  Strong winds also a major problem in New Mexico that caused a train to derail there.  This is incredible.</p><p>And then, look at this, again, back to Texas, stunning videos, strong winds blew over a tractor trailer.  It was -- it was unbelievable.  We'll show it to you, hopefully, in a moment.  It wasn't the only one, though, there's been reports of wind speeds up to 70 miles per hour, causing multiple trucks to blow over.  This is happening in different parts of the country.  No word on the conditions of the driver.  Again, we'll get that video to you later in the show.</p><p>All right, the college admission scandal is now in federal court, actress Lori Loughlin posting $1 million bond in Los Angeles.  She and her fashion designer husband are among 50 people facing fraud charges for allegedly paying bribes to get their daughters into colleges.  One of the schools in the heart of the scandal, University of Southern California.  The university says applicants who are connected to the admissions cheating scheme are going to be denied admission.  A case-by-case review will be conducted for students who are already enrolled at USC and may be connected to the scheme.</p><p>And ABC News reports the FBI uncovered the $25 million nationwide college admissions cheating scandal by accident, while agents were working on unrelated securities fraud cases.  The agents reportedly received a tip from somebody that was connected to the investigation about the alleged bribe, paid to the then-head women's soccer coach at Yale.  Maria, this story just continues to fascinate the country, and a lot of kids that didn't get into those schools, I'm sure, are pretty angry as their parents are as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  With good reason.  Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  Uh-hmm.  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, as we just heard, Beto O'Rourke makes his Presidential announcement official.  We've got a lot more on that after a short break.  Stay with us, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Big show this morning.  Coming up right here, South Dakota Senator and Armed Services Committee member Mike Rounds is with us.  Oregon Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member Greg Walden with some breaking news this morning from him.  Former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, and Fox News Contributor Karl Rove joining us after an op-ed this morning.  And former Presidential candidate and former Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee, joining us as well.  Big three hours ahead.  Don't miss a moment of it.</p><p>We want to talk right here about Huawei.  It is in court today, lawyers for the Chinese telecom giant expected to appear in federal court later this morning, to answer charges that the company violated Iran trade tensions.  Huawei is accused of dealing with Iran through a front company in Hong Kong.  The company's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada, accused of lying to banks about it.  She's now awaiting extradition to the United States.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, Forbes Media Chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate Steve Forbes joining us here.  Along with national security analyst and Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thanks.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're welcome.  Yes, I mean, this Huawei story keeps getting worse.  I know that they arrested her because of the Iran sanctions, and dealing with Iran.  But there's also obviously, the privacy issues and the espionage that we've been talking about so much, Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.  And the Iran sanctions violations are very serious.  I mean, what we've seen is over the past 10 years, probably, millions and millions of dollars paid by financial institutions, especially those based in New York as it relates to Iran sanctions.  You're seeing most major banks on Wall Street have mediators and have people that are working on a daily basis to improve their systems, so they don't evade sanctions.  So, to think that this is a sort of a one-off for this company is actually wrong.  I mean, anybody in Wall Street can tell you that they're running scared of any sort of violation of Iran sanctions.  It's quite serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, I look at the Iran sanctions as one part of it, but really, the more -- the interesting part from my standpoint is the espionage issues, and the fact that it's gone across the world and to African countries and European countries, will set up your telecom infrastructure.  No worries.  And then, of course, they're tapping into their conversations and data.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  And unfortunately there, they've got a huge head start.  But what I think it's eventually going to save us in the next few years, and we'll get real 5G out there.  It's going to be a whole different architecture, massive new investments are going to be required.  In that way, we can keep the Huawei's of the world out.  Also underscores in terms of our dispute with China.  Going after that CFO, going after specific companies, is a far more effective way of dealing with China than the tariffs, which end up hurting us not as much as China.  But we get hurt too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm curious, Steve, are enough of our allies standing alongside of us in terms of pushing back on Huawei and the use of that technology.  Because, again, you've seen with -- which Maria was way ahead on in her interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to crack down, and the message that we sent to Germany about we're not going to -- we're going to pull back on our intelligence share if you don't get in -- you get on board with us in terms of taking on Huawei.  And then the grave danger of that poses to all other nations in terms of the espionage and the theft, are enough of our allies standing with us?  Because they're (INAUDIBLE) few at this point.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, I think they had to see how serious are we about this.  It's one thing to say, oh, well, why don't you do this and that, but if you don't follow through one, they're not going to follow through.  And I think our -- one of the things Huawei did was to make their stuff so cheap.  It was a lost leader to get in there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was just going to say there's a cost issue here, right?</p><p>FORBES:  And so all of these countries got this great bargain, 50 percent off, and now they're indebted.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Nothing is ever free.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nothing is free.  There's no free lunch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even small telecom providers here in the United States have used Huawei technology, and that is another later, another issue for this administration to tackle, because again, they're complaining about higher costs if they use different telecom equipment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a really serious issue.  And by the way, sidelining this issue is this potential trade deal with China.  I think it's very ominous that we haven't heard yet, any specific date for Xi Jinping to meet with President Trump as they were expecting to do at the end of March in Mar-a-Lago.  Where do these trade discussions stand now?  It sure feels like China is pushing back on making any changes to the I.P. theft and the forced transfer of technology.  All we've heard in terms of the give on China side is they're going to buy more stuff from the U.S. which is not going to cut it for a deal with the U.S.</p><p>FORBES:  Well, the question is about enforcement is one of the things we want to do to be able to put tariffs on Chinese goods and they can't put tariffs on ours if we think they're engage in violations, the Chinese are not going to go along with that.  And so, well, what you have here is a game of chicken, and I think the key thing is, if we continue to do what we did against Huawei and some other companies, that's the message to get across.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the message is to punish bad actors but not punish companies like, say, European automakers that make cars here in the U.S. that create U.S. jobs.  It's important to point out that we've heard earlier this week that the momentum seems to be slipping for auto import tariff, something that President Trump has talked about a lot, a 25 percent levy potentially on car imports to the United States.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  That's so called Section 232.  If that came, then that would devastate the global economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it would hurt U.S. jobs.  These are companies across the south, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, that have been real job creators in the United States.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they have.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they're actually -- they're helping our trade deficit by exporting cars overseas that they make here.</p><p>FORBES:  BMW is ready to export 100,000 vehicles they make in South Carolina.  What's not to like?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  So, that's -- this is a positive sign.  Punish the bad actors but people who actually create jobs here in the United States who are on our side, ease up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's take a short break on that note.  And when we come back, a modern day mob hit.  The alleged boss of the Gambino crime family was gunned down outside of his home.  We've got the details coming up right after this.  And then, Gary Cohn speaking out, President Trump's former economic adviser says the President is \"desperate\" to sign a deal with China, that's next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures are mixed right now, pretty good reversal in the last 20 minutes, Dow Industrials now down four points, the S&amp;P down a quarter, and the NASDAQ is up six.  Market uncertainty this morning.  There's some uncertainty obviously over Britain's exit from the European Union as well as a deal between the U.S. and China.  Now, Gary Cohn, former economic adviser to President Trump spoke out on a deal with China in a new interview, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY COHN, FORMER ECONOMIC ADVISER TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:  I think the U.S. is desperate right now for an agreement.</p><p>STEPHEN DUBNER, HOST, FREAKONOMICS:  An agreement or headline?</p><p>COHN:  The President needs a win.  The only big open issue right now that he could claim as a big win, that he hope would have a big impact on the stock market would be Chinese resolution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A new report now says that the U.S. and China are pushing back a meeting between the President and Xi Jinping to at least April of this year.  Joining us right now is Russell Investments Senior Portfolio Manager Kevin Divney.  Kevin, it's good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>KEVIN DIVNEY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUSSELL INVESTMENTS:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How important is that meeting and this deal between the two countries for the markets?</p><p>DIVNEY:  The market's pricing in that something is going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DIVNEY:  And if you saw last earnings season, the thing that was hurting U.S. earnings was Chinese exposure.  The Chinese economy is hurting much more than the U.S. economy, and it seems as if the market is shrugging off any kind of headline risk, and they're looking to what's going on the -- what's going on the ground in China.  So, the market is pricing it in, and there's probably some more risk to the upside here.  And a lot of risk to the downside if something doesn't happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then you've got Brexit, Parliament shuts down the latest deal for Britain's exit from the European Union.  The M.P.s voted yesterday to reject the no-deal exit under any circumstances.  Prime Minister Theresa May expected to try one more plan this week before a potential vote to delay Britain's exit from the European Union, is that a factor for you, for markets?</p><p>DIVNEY:  Fundamentally, European economies are decoupling from the U.S., who see PMIs almost getting to negative territory.  You see earnings decelerate, you see spending coming down.  U.S. companies are growing and they're still investing.  So, I think investors have hedged that away and looking at the momentum of the U.S. economy and the labor market here.  So, it's being compartmentalize, and from an allocation perspective, I think a lot of people are just looking at the U.S. robustness right now.</p><p>FORBES:  Can the U.S. stay robust if China and Japan and Europe, Germany, especially are still in the water?</p><p>DIVNEY:  I think so.  There's two main drivers we're looking at, one, the labor market is really strong right now.  You see labor force participation from that really high earning, high spending group, 25 to 54, has been gone from 80 percent of its low three years ago to 83 percent.  Also on earnings, if you look at this market expansion, a lot of the expansion has been driven by the profit margin expansion.  So earnings have grown, we have the 10-year anniversary last night at the bull market.  But most Bull Markets have been driving about a third by profit growth.  In this expansion, something about two thirds of profit growth.  So, even last earnings season, we saw profits flatten and they may go down a bit, but we're at peak margins, and the topline sales expectations for the U.S. have not been revised down meaningfully.  Everybody knows earnings have going into 2019, but the topline is still around five or six percent --</p><p>FORBES:  Are you worried about the slowness in the first quarter in the U.S. economy, or is that just a blip?</p><p>DIVNEY:  It's reminding me of what happened in 2015, 2016, which was somewhat fascinating, because you saw an earnings contraction and an earnings expansion after that, for the first time without a recessions since the postwar period.  So, I think companies adapt and also the -- people coming back into the labor force is one of the big stories, I think people aren't really getting, people are coming back in, they were underemployed or unemployed, and that momentum continues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're not going to get the profit growth that we saw last year this year, that's for sure.  So, that's a worry that we're really are seeing a slowdown in the U.S., Europe on top of that, China on top of that.</p><p>DIVNEY:  Domestically-focused companies, tech-focused companies, high-margin companies, and it's a little bit ironic when you think about this, some people would pretend that you want to get into value defensive-type environments when you're in a contracting environment.  That will be a premium on growth shares.  Like premium on companies that have higher margin because if growth is more rare in the economy and we're starting to see consensus estimates for the second half drift up a little bit.  So, we're seeing (INAUDIBLE) Q2.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  And I know that now, many people are looking toward 2020.</p><p>DIVNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick, would you put new money to work in small and mid-cap names, which is where you've been, right?</p><p>DIVNEY:  We're in all-cap and large-cap, but, yes, we're looking for the more pro-cyclical tech consumer cyclicals where we're looking to put more money to work and where we're exposed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin, it's good to have you on the show.</p><p>DIVNEY:  Thanks for being here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Kevin Divney joining us there.  Coming up, the race to 2020, Beto O'Rourke officially threw his hat in the ring.  We are all taking a look at the Presidential line-up.  And it is Pie Day.

It was a wild day of trading yesterday, the major indices finished the day higher, when all was said and done.</p><p>Dow Industrials up 148 points, two-thirds of 1 percent.  S&amp;P 500 yesterday up almost 20 points and the NASDAQ was up 52, at the close.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the indices, higher across the board, FT 100 in London, up 41 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris up 22 and the DAX Index in Germany up just 3 points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, the worst performer was China, Nikkei Average -- the Japanese market flat, but the Shanghai Composite down one and a quarter percent, in China.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is under pressure this morning, a California jury awarding a woman $29 million tied to a cancer diagnosis from baby powder.

This is defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Beto joins a growing list of contenders looking to unseat President Trump in next year's election, joining us right now is RealClearPolitics, White House Reporter, Philip Wegmann, Philip, good to have you on the program this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, REAL CLEAR POLITICS:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to Beto?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, look, if magazine writers were the ones who decided who is going to be president of the United States, Beto O'Rourke would already be in the White House.  There have been so many magazine profiles about this guy, he's going to have to run the old-fashion way.</p><p>And I think what we're going to find out, what Beto O'Rourke is going to realize is that the other candidates who are competing against him are going to ask a lot tougher questions than a lot of the journalists who have been following him when he was challenging Senator Ted Cruz and who kept following him ever since.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They call him baby candidate, Dagen.  How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- well, I think that -- I have said this before, he would not be getting as nearly as much attention particularly from the media and celebrities in Hollywood if he'd looked like somebody else, but he does look like one of the candidates, quite frankly, number one.</p><p>Number two, he has got Annie Leibovitz's photographs in Vanity Fair, on the cover with his dog, to make him likable, that's not an accident.  And he said in the -- in the cover story, I want to be in it, man, I'm just born to be in it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Obnoxious.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has the advantage of the American people not knowing a whole lot about him at this point, he is a young face and he gave Ted Cruz a run for his money where he came within five percentage points, beating Ted Cruz in an increasingly purple state.</p><p>Again, I think people see him as a vice presidential candidate, but him with, say, Joe Biden, Joe Biden, historically, had trouble raising money, particularly in the presidential race, Beto can raise some money, we know that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's not running for vice president, he's running for president.</p><p>FORBES:  No, he's no more running for vice president under Barack Obama after sensational speech in the 2004 convention.  It was going to be settled (INAUDIBLE) in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what are his policies?  What's his messaging?  What is he going to do?</p><p>FORBES:  His messaging --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the last time we went voting --</p><p>FORBES:  All of the candidates --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for someone who's attractive, we didn't like the policies at the end of the day.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, they're all the same.  They're all trying to find new ways, going after cows and things like that to distinguish themselves (INAUDIBLE) field.  And so, his thing is going to be, he's better looking, he's got the glamor, he's got good photographers and that kind of stuff, sort of the Kennedy thing, but substance free --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, you know what?</p><p>FORBES:  In terms of distinguishing himself from other candidates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But maybe you can be substance free because the substance has been regurgitated by the candidates who are already out there, is appalling and unappealing to a lot of Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you mean like the Green Deal?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- of wealth confiscation, Medicare-for-all, which by the way, I want to point out Bernie Sanders' bill that Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, all signed on to that eradicates and abolishes and outlaws --</p><p>FORBES:  Using Medicare is false advertising, but it's not Medicare.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  You know, I have a question for Philip, so Slate Magazine, which is not exactly a conservative publication, actually hit Beto, and said that he has --</p><p>WEGMANN:  Right.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  -- I'm paraphrasing them, but he -- they said he has no idea why he's running, is an entitled rich, white guy, actually the future of the Democratic Party?</p><p>WEGMANN:  Well, I mean, that's going to be the script that I think a lot of the opposition is going to lodge against him.  Because he -- they're going to try and paint him as a sort of holding coffee old type who is aimless, who lost his last bid and who really hasn't done a lot to, you know, deserve the type of nomination.</p><p>And I think that those are going to be incredibly powerful attacks, when like, Steve said a second ago, this is not going to be necessarily the most substantive debate about who the nominee should be because the field is already so far left.</p><p>So, we're going to see a personality-driven race, that's my thought from a lot of (INAUDIBLE) talking to.  And I think that his competition is going to be a lot of the more charismatic, energetic candidates on the left, who kind of do fill that Obama lane.  And my thought here is perhaps Beto O'Rourke might be too late.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In this field, you only-- if you're a Democrat, you only have to, kind of, be normal and not -- and not crazy and extreme.  You have a Democratic Party that is not only getting behind abolishing all private health insurance in this country.</p><p>Basically driving up the price of gasoline and all fossil fuels, our electricity bills, to the moon, which crushes the poor, but also the party of, well, anti-Semitism and infanticide because there has not been enough pushback from the leadership in the party and from some of these candidates on the anti-Semitic comments and on the third trimester abortion bills.</p><p>FORBES:  And another thing in this field, when you look at most of these candidates is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  -- not only they are not having any real differences on issues, but what have they done with their lives.  Bernie didn't get a job until he was 53.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, is that right?  I did not know that.  We got to get to this.  Let me ask you this, Philip, because Andrew Weissmann, one of the most prominent members of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team, will leave the Justice Department.  That's according to two sources speaking to NPR.</p><p>We know that this is an individual who was at the Department of Justice when they first came up with the dossier, from Fusion GPS, he knew that the dossier was paid by Hillary Clinton.  And two weeks ago, Congresswoman Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows sent a letter to William Barr, saying we want accountability.</p><p>What did he say about the fact he's totally conflicted because he knew about the dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for it, and now, he's Special Counsel's assistant or deputy?</p><p>WEGMANN:  So, I think what's interesting about Weissmann's exit is that this is a prosecutor who a lot of people in the Trump campaign were most worried about.  If you remember, it was Steve Bannon who called Weissmann, a killer, who said that he was the LeBron James of these types of investigations.</p><p>It seems that, you know, he was able to bring charges against Manafort, but so far, there hasn't been anything that has stuck against the President.  So, I think that the White House sees this as a precursor to the investigation wrapping up.  And for now, there's nothing that it seems that Weissmann was able to get against the President himself.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think that the letter from the congressmen, Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows is sort of the catalyst that got him packing up?</p><p>WEGMANN:  You know, that's certainly possible, we don't know right now, because the thing about the Special Counsel is that, you know, they don't leak.</p><p>And so, that certainly could have been a (INAUDIBLE) for this, but where I think that from the NPR report which broke the story, the way that this is being seen right now, is that, you know, the things are wrapping up and finally after this multiyear saga, it might come to an end.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Philip, we'll leave it there.  Good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>WEGMANN:  Thank you, Ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Philip Wegmann, RealClearPolitics.</p><p>Meanwhile, a reputed mob boss was shot and killed outside of his home in New York City, Cheryl Casone with the details on that, Cheryl, what a story.</p><p>CASONE:  It really is, Maria.

Headlines across America this morning.  The L.A. Times is reporting Johnson &amp; Johnson is found liable for a California woman's baby powder-linked cancer.  The company has been ordered to pay $29 million to the woman for causing her cancer.  This is Johnson &amp; Johnson's seventh trial loss over claims it hid the health risks of its baby powder for 50 years.</p><p>The Charlotte Observer, says bank of American stadium is overvalued by about $485 million, (INAUDIBLE) to the Carolina Panthers after a county re-evaluation.  The stadium value surged from $135 million to $572 million.  But the team says, the facility is worth about 87 million.

Actress Lori Loughlin posting $1 million after appearing in court for her alleged role in the college admission scandal.

When the news broke of the college admission scandal, Loughlin's daughter, Olivia Jade, was reportedly spending spring break on a University of South California official's yacht.  Joining us right now with reaction is Fox News Contributor and \"Greg Gutfeld Show,\" Kat Timpf; along with former Obama Campaign Advisor and Democratic Strategists, Robin Biro; as well as Axios Markets Newsletter Author Dion Rabouin; and Fox News Contributor and National Security Analyst Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see everybody.  Thank you so much for joining us.  Your reaction, Kat?</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think that it's really quite a sad thing that she's probably going to go to jail for this, to send a kid to school that openly admitted she has no interest in school.  She said, she want -- she's like, I'm not really into school, but I want to like go party; I want to go to the games.  That's like sadder than old (INAUDIBLE) than me.  I really, really think it is.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TIMPF:  And it's just helping her daughter either.  Because, like, those lesson, like hard work pays off -- and you have to work hard for what you want.  She's not creating a future for her daughter, she's creating a monster by just making her so entitled and thinking she could just -- because she has a rich mom and dad, she can do whatever she wants.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Biro, what do you think?  How do you see it?</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN ADVISOR AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS:  Oh, you know, power; money and power have always bought influence, of course.  But what really gets me is that they have the nerve to claim tax deduction.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIRO:  Are you serious?  Yes, I just can't believe it.  And I feel bad for the kids who really worked and tried so hard, that a spot was taken from them for something like this.</p><p>TIMPF:  This isn't victim less.  They could have gotten in and didn't because of this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we wanted to get your reaction, all of you, because you're the millennial generation, just to see if there's a different way to view this.  Social media went nuts over this, as you know.  I mean, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp all talking about the scandals.  Dion, your take on it?</p><p>DION RABOUIN, AUTHOR, AXIOS MARKETS NEWSLETTER:  Yes, my take on this is just that, you know, I hope they all go to jail.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.  Well, look, here's the thing, there's not really a plea deal to be had here, you know.  It's like, we you got you on tape; we know that you did it.  We've got you talking about what you're going to do, how you're going to do it, what you plan on doing with the money, all that.  And there's not really a link up; there's no one up the chain that we want to get.  They've already got kind of the mastermind behind the scandal.  So, there's really no reason these guys should get a sweetheart deal or, you know, slap on the wrist; folks need to go to jail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, Morgan, I know that parents will do just about anything for their kids and to get their kids into colleges.  But this was a real structure, I mean, this was a very elaborate scheme.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, Maria.  What I'm hearing from my friends in Southern California is typical, like, any money launderer, or any front company.  This guy, he had like, legitimate tutoring business.  This goes really deep.  I spoke to her friend just two days ago, who tutored his daughters on the SAT, and said there was a number of legitimate things he did.  And what he would do is penetrate the wealthiest high schools.  He would reportedly work with some of the pride wealth managers.</p><p>Again, this is going to go so much deeper than what we realize; this was a real scheme.  And at a time, when we talk about millennials, we're actually facing such extremely high rates of college indebtedness, that people are still trying to pay off student loans.  They can't buy homes.  It's sort of, I think, a big slap on the face.  I know that I paid for my schools through scholarships and loans, and I'm still paying off my MBA.  And so, when you see that, when you're work hard to get these degrees and then you see it so blatantly taken advantage off.  It's really hard to swallow.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and how about all those students who didn't get in because there wasn't a spot for them?  There's that as well.</p><p>TIMPF:  Who were actually qualified and could've gotten in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>TIMPF:  But Olivia Jade wanted a party at the football game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>TIMPF:  And had a rich mommy and daddy.  I'd be furious if I applied to USC and didn't get in, and then saw this was going on.</p><p>RABOUIN:  There are a lot of people who applied to the university of spoiled children, because they want --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  University of spoiled children.</p><p>BIRO:  The veteran in me wants them to go to military school now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, did any of you experience that outage last night on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp -- technical issues all day yesterday.  Facebook had to take to rival, Twitter, to explain what the heck was going on.  Social media users shared their responses to the technical difficulties.  We're going to show some on screen, what was your reaction?</p><p>TIMPF:  It was awful.  I was eating dinner yesterday, and I couldn't post a picture of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, no!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TIMPF:  It's like, why am I even eating at all?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hilarious!</p><p>BIRO:  Frankly, I was glad my screen time on my Apple app would go down.  Because I cringe every time, I'm like, oh, look at my screen time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's funny!  Guys, thank you.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, March 14th.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Boeing 737 Max jets have been grounded in the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Boeing is an incredible company.  And hopefully they'll very quickly come up with the answer but until they do, the planes are grounded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Reports say that the Ethiopian Airlines crash shows similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.  There was some evidence at the site which caused the President to say all of the 737s should be grounded.  We've got the very latest this morning.</p><p>Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation now.  At the center of the probe, the social media giant's data deals with other technology companies.  It comes after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp yesterday.</p><p>And a deadly and historic blizzard brings hurricane force winds to the central U.S. -- look at this.  The high winds caused trains and tractor trailers to flip over entirely.  Incredible pictures there.</p><p>Britain's exit from the E.U. may not happen on March 29th now.  One British child' sends a heartwarming letter to the President of the European Council and it is going viral this morning.  We've got it.</p><p>Futures this morning indicating the markets will open lower.  We are at the lows of the morning this morning.  We have been weakening throughout the morning this morning.</p><p>Dow Industrials now down 63 points, quarter of a percent.  S&amp;P 500 down 6.  And the Nasdaq down 10 as you can see.</p><p>It was a wild day yesterday of trading, major indices finished higher when all was said and done.  Dow Industrials up 148 points at the close yesterday.  The S&amp;P was up almost 20.  And the Nasdaq was up 52 points yesterday on Wall Street.</p><p>In Europe this morning the indices are mixed, mostly higher.  FT 100 up 28 points.  The CAC 40 in Paris 16.  The DAX index has turned lower.  It's down 19 points right now.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, mixed story there.  China was the worst performer.  Shanghai composite down 1.25 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman and former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes, and national security analyst Fox News contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You, too.  Good to see you.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It will be interesting today.  Acting Defense Secretary Shanahan goes before Congress today for the first time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting from that?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, he'll be with General Joe Dunford.  I think that he's going to get questioned a lot perhaps about the President's Syria policy.  And I think a lot of people are going to use this as an opportunity to grill him because they haven't since his contentious hearing for whenever he became deputy secretary.</p><p>FORBES:  And he has a Boeing background, doesn't he?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  So he'll get grilled on that as well.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Which is not necessarily fair, but yes.</p><p>FORBES:  It isn't fair but this is not a fair time.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's true.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>We're also watching markets which have worsened in the last half an hour.  Since we started the show, things have completely reversed course.</p><p>One of the issues seems to be GE.  The stock is down and the company is talking about 2019 issuing its outlook for the year.  The Dow Industrials are now down 69 points, the S&amp;P down 6 and the Nasdaq down 10.5.</p><p>We don't have any major economic data coming out this morning but you're seeing some individual stories really impacting the broader markets.  What do you think?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And I know that we're getting into the Boeing story right here.  But I think when you talk about the top exporter out of the United States, which Boeing is, in terms of overall sales and the most valuable -- or it was most valuable stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of the 30 stocks in the Dow, that you do have confidence that's been rattled.</p><p>I think that you -- when you feel like a brand as important as Boeing has been tarnished and people don't know what the road looks like ahead, if people are already on -- ready to sell, this could cause that.  Clearly, the stock has taken a big drive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Major dive.  Boeing shares have lost $25 billion since the Ethiopian crash.  That's about 10 percent on Boeing shares.</p><p>GE is falling out of bed this morning.  The company is reporting that 2019 earnings are going to be below expectations.  Stock is now down better than 4 percent.  They're talking about 50 to 60 cents a share in 2019 but that's lower than the estimate, which is currently for 70 cents a share.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  They always disappoint.  There's always something new coming along, something in the past keeps cropping up and so we have to remember, it got down as low as 6, got as high as above 10.  But they continue to disappoint.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FORBES:  And this whole market, we shouldn't forget, has had a huge rally.  What it needs now is another piece of good news, i.e.  China trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we have not seen the meeting set.  Now, the President says that they're going to push this meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping until April of this year.  So we don't have a date yet.</p><p>And as you can see, all of this seems to be weighing on markets -- GE, Boeing, the uncertainty over a China trade deal.</p><p>And our top story this hour is, of course, Boeing.  The Federal Aviation Administration has announced that it will ground all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 jets.  It comes amid new data linking Sunday's Ethiopian Airline's crash and last October's Lion Air crash.</p><p>President Trump announced the decision from the White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition, to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and planes associated with that line.  I've spoken to Elaine Chao Secretary of Transportation, Dan Elwell acting administrator at the FAA, and to Dennis Muilenburg CEO of Boeing.</p><p>It's a terrible, terrible thing.  Boeing is an incredible company.  They are working very, very hard right now.  And hopefully they'll very quickly come up with the answer but until they do, the planes are grounded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is South Dakota senator, member of the Housing, Transportation and Community Development Subcommittee and pilot himself, Mike Rounds.  Senator -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SENATOR MIKE ROUNDS (R), SOUTH DAKOTA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What can you tell us about the Boeing situation?</p><p>ROUNDS:  Well, we don't know a whole lot more about it than what you've just shared.  To begin with, it's -- Boeing has a fantastic record to begin with.  The 737 by itself has a marvelous record for years and years.  The 737 Max, in particular the -8, this particular one now we've had two incidents.  They have been very unfortunate.  We've had loss of life.</p><p>The FAA does have a good system in place.  They've also received some what we call the NASA (ph) reports.  This is where if a pilot flying something that's not right, they can make an anonymous report that can help in terms of safety.  And that's been a very successful program, year in and year out.</p><p>My understanding is that there have been several reports that Boeing and the FAA may very well be able to go back in and pick up some additional data.  It sounds like they've also received some very accurate information using some satellite tracking data that does correlate some similarities between both of these incidents and I think that's the reason why they've taken this particular step to ground this aircraft at this time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, as a pilot yourself, were there issues that the pilots were not aware of with the upgrade that the plane went through?  We haven't heard from Boeing which is an issue.</p><p>The CEO needs to come out and explain what's going on here.  Otherwise, we're seeing people sell now and think later.</p><p>ROUNDS:  You know what, what we find as pilots, we get trained based upon the type of aircraft that we're going to fly.  Pilots that are going to fly a 737, they'll get what they call a type rating which is specific to a particular type.</p><p>But within those type ratings they'll also have different upgrades to software.  And as the software becomes more and more complicated, the training that goes into it is critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROUNDS:  And that's part of the discussion that I think that they're going to have is are the pilots currently aware of what might happen?  Do they understand what's running in the background?  Do they know what happens in certain conditions either on take-off or on landing that they need to be aware of?</p><p>And at the same time, as they become more complicated, they can also add more and more safety features into the software that sometimes unless the pilot is aware of may seem to be a unique occurrence that they have to respond to.</p><p>But in this particular case and in future cases I am quite certain that the FAA will take a look at the software and the packages that go into them and they'll evaluate them.  But that's the reason we've got the FAA on top of it.  And I think they're perfectly capable of finding out what it is and working with Boeing to resolve this as quickly as possible.</p><p>The unfortunate part is we've had loss of life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in the meantime all of these planes are grounded in the U.S. as the FAA does that.  Travelers have been reacting to these groundings.  Here's what we found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK KELLER, AIRLINE PASSENGER:  I was flying back from Daytona Beach, American Airlines today with a couple of flights and I wanted to make sure what plane I was getting on because I probably wouldn't have gotten on the Max.</p><p>JEFF RUHDE, AIRLINE PASSENGER:  We had been talking about this issue and we're glad to know we don't have to fly home on one of those planes tonight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I guess there's more relief than anything else that these planes are grounded because people don't know.  It's an unknown.</p><p>Senator -- I've got to get your take on the big vote today, the bill to block the President's national emergency declaration.  How are you going to vote?</p><p>Senator?  Mike Rounds -- are you with us?</p><p>All right.  We want to fix the issues with Senator Mike Rounds and find out how he's going to vote.  We will get back to him as soon as that is fixed.  Do we have Senator Mike Rounds back?</p><p>All right.  Quick break, then.</p><p>Winter's last call -- parts of the country dealing with intense blizzard conditions.</p><p>Wanting to be friends meanwhile -- one British girl's heartfelt offer of friendship to the European Union.  Her message ahead.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>And I'm back with Senator Mike Rounds.  Senator, thank you so much.  Sorry about the technical issues.</p><p>The Senate is obviously going to vote today to block the President's national emergency declaration.  How are you voting?</p><p>ROUNDS:  I'll be supporting the President's position and on this particular vote, I think he has made the point that there is -- there is a national emergency at the border.  We're seeing it.</p><p>What's happening is we've got thousands, literally in some cases 76,000 individuals trying to get across in a month.  They're overwhelming the manpower that we've got at the southern border.</p><p>And in doing so now the Mexican drug cartels have figured it out and when we're busy just taking in these folks who are coming in and asking for asylum, they're finding ways to get into the rest of the country.  But they're crossing the border.  And it's not just at the ports of entry.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you've got five --</p><p>ROUNDS:  I'll support the President's position.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- five Republicans though are not and as a result it's likely going to pass the Senate, right.  And then the President will veto it.</p><p>ROUNDS:  That's right.  And I think, you know, this is the unfortunate part.  We thought there might be a way to put together a package deal to where those individuals could express the concerns that they've got with the constitutional issue surrounding the emergency declaration.</p><p>Unfortunately we weren't able to resolve it with the White House and we end up in this a situation where the President will probably have to exercise his veto authority which would then be sustained by the House when it comes before them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you don't think that this would actually -- that the re-appeal, fighting back the President's veto will actually come to pass?</p><p>ROUNDS:  I don't think that they'll be able to override the President's veto.  That's correct.</p><p>Look, I really think the biggest challenge is going to come in October as we move forward with the appropriations package in future years.  We'd estimated that we may need $25 billion for the security at the southern border.  The President may have here as much as $8 billion, some of which is going to be challenged in court for years.</p><p>Unfortunately, I think with Democrats in control of the House, I don't think they will offer any sort of an appropriations package that allows the President to use these emergency funds in the future, very similar to what we do with, you know, not allowing the federal government -- we restrict the federal government from using any funds for abortions with the Hyde Amendment.</p><p>My suspicion is there will be an amendment on every appropriation bill from this point forward that the President sees that will restrict his use of funds for anything at the border.  And that's very unfortunate.</p><p>I had hoped that we'd be able to resolve that before that came to play.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator -- it's good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>ROUNDS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Mike Rounds joining us there.</p><p>Meanwhile, this -- a deadly and historic blizzard bringing hurricane force winds to the central country.  Take a look at that.</p><p>This tractor trailer in Texas completely flipped over.  More than 1,000 flights were canceled at Denver's airport.</p><p>Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean in the Weather Center now.  Janice -- good morning.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Maria -- one for the record books.  A hundred-mile-per-hour gusts in Texas, 80-mile-per-hour gusts in Denver, Colorado.  This was like a winter hurricane across the central plains.  Different dynamics obviously than a hurricane but the same sort of scope and power.</p><p>And we still have blizzard warnings for parts of the Rockies, the Northern Plains.  Flooding imminent ahead of this system with several inches of rainfall.  We had tornadoes yesterday, all part of the same system.</p><p>The threat for tornadic activity from the Great Lakes down towards the Southern Plains.  Again, the blizzard conditions will be ongoing across portions of the Northern Plains, through the upper Midwest.  We have wind gusts still at 50 and 60 miles per hour; parts of Nebraska, up towards the upper Midwest.</p><p>The low will move into Canada but again, we're still dealing with the threat for not only strong winds but blizzard conditions.  We had over a foot of snow, 45 inches of snow in the Colorado Rockies from this system, Maria.  And the potential again for severe storms and flooding.</p><p>The flooding potential will be imminent because we have a lot of ice jams going on and water just over-topping some of the rivers and streams across portions of the upper Midwest and the Ohio Valley.</p><p>This one is for the record books, Maria -- the great blizzard, March 2019 will go down in some of the meteorology textbooks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.</p><p>DEAN:  Incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Janice -- thank you.</p><p>DEAN:  You've got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Janice Dean.</p><p>Coming up, Gary Cohn is sounding off.  The former economic adviser to the President commenting on President Trump's desire for a trade deal with China.  We'll bring you his comments next.</p><p>And then investing in Uber -- SoftBank considering putting a billion dollars in the ride-sharing company, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are lower this morning.  Futures indicating a decline of about 50 points on the Dow Industrials, 3 points lower on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq down 2 points.  This is off of the lows of the morning.</p><p>But investors are waiting on a deal between the U.S. and China.  And there's some tensions around that.  A new report says that the U.S. and China are pushing back a meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to at least April of this year.</p><p>Meanwhile Gary Cohn, former economic advisor to President Trump, spoke out on a deal with China in a new interview.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARY COHN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  I think the U.S. is desperate right now for an agreement.</p><p>STEPHEN DUBNER, FREAKONOMICS:  An agreement or a headline?</p><p>COHN:  The President needs a win.  The only big open issue right now that he could claim as a big win that you hope would have a big impact on the stock market would be a Chinese resolution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Vested chief economist Milton Ezrati.  Milton -- good to have you on the program.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MILTON EZRATI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, VESTED:  Pleasure to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've seen the Chinese economy see a real impact from this uncertainty over a U.S.-China deal.  What are you expecting here?</p><p>EZRATI:  Well, I think the Chinese are going to sign a deal.  Their economy has suffered tremendously, not just from the tariffs.  There's a natural slowdown.  It's not the developing economy it was.</p><p>A lot of industry is leaving China, not just to avoid the tariffs but also they're leaving because the wages there have gone up more than in neighboring countries -- Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia.</p><p>So China -- this has come at a bad point for China.  They have to make a deal.  They need us more than we need them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The last thing China wants is unrest in the streets, right -- Steve?</p><p>FORBES:  That's right.  The whole deal with the communist regime is they deliver the goods so you put up with the regime's suppression as long as you have the freedom to get rich.  And now we know China's been faking their economic statistics or rather inflating them, maybe they're getting -- have that college scandal bug in them.</p><p>But anyway, nobody believes those numbers anymore and they've got to deliver and they haven't been able to deliver.</p><p>EZRATI:  Yes.  I think it's noteworthy in this respect on China, if you go back to 2008, the recession of '08 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>EZRATI:  -- the whole globe was in recession.  The Chinese don't have much of a social safety net.  They laid people off and literally there were party members --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FORBES:  It's amazing how China does the GDP.  They would have the goal -- this is the goal for the GDP and they tell local governments -- you know, government spends, crazy way we do GDP is that government spends.  That counts as plus on GDP.</p><p>So they would tell these local governments, spend to make sure we reach that 8 percent target, 9 percent target -- whatever it was.  So it's really since 2008 especially, a false boom.  It's not from free market forces at work.  It's directed from the top.  That's why you have this massive borrowing in China, to try to inflate those GDP numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fascinating.</p><p>What about the U.S.?  How do you see the economy here?</p><p>EZRATI:  I think the U.S. Economy is slowing now.  But I don't think it's going to be a lasting thing.  I actually think it will pick up in the second half of the year.  And the consumers spent a little ahead of income growth last year.  He and she are pulling in their horn.  That's the first quarter this year, maybe into the spring.</p><p>Capital spending which had done very well in '17, '18, slowed in the last part of last year.  It's beginning to pick up already.  Housing seems to have stabilized.  It was off.  So I think we'll see stronger growth in the second half of the year.</p><p>FORBES:  But it depends on a China deal.</p><p>EZRATI:  Yes, it depends on a China deal.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Were you surprised that Gary Cohn said that U.S. was desperate for a deal.  I mean to me, that interview seemed somewhat personal.  He was hitting the barrel -- some of his former colleagues at the White House, which is a little surprising to me.  I don't know if he was settling scores or if he actually believes that we're desperate for a deal.</p><p>EZRATI:  I think he believes we're getting a deal.  I don't know what motivates the man.  And I don't think I ever will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about tax concerns.  Minnesota residents are reportedly buying up muni bonds to reduce their tax burden.  The state has the fourth highest state income tax rate in the U.S.  That was at 9.85 percent, according to Turbo Tax.</p><p>So Milton -- it's not just the northeast that's dealing with the fallout of high rates.  You're seeing a massive exodus in some of the high tax states in the U.S.</p><p>EZRATI:  Well, it is.  I mean this deal has effectively turned the public -- if they don't like the taxes now, they have no reprieve except to either leave or go to their state capital and say stop this.  Those are their only options.</p><p>They used to be able to effectively socialize the taxes by spreading it out through the rest of the country.  That's gone now.</p><p>New York is suffering that.  That's another problem for the city, New York state and obviously all the high tax states.</p><p>FORBES:  Do you think Albany and New York City, Gracie Mansion realize how precarious New York's position is especially in the city?</p><p>I mean I'm old enough to remember the mid-1970s.  Are we going to have a repeat of that?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can New York go bankrupt?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  Can New York go bankrupt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that the issue?</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  That's what I'm asking.</p><p>EZRATI:  That's right.  The state arranged the bill pay for the city effectively and cut the credit cards in half.  And it could happen again.  I don't think it's going to happen if and until we have a recession.</p><p>But the city -- this is the best of times for New York City.  Unemployment is low.  The market remains relatively buoyant.  Everything is right for the city and they're still running a deficit.  They call it a gap.  It's a deficit of almost $4 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Governor Cuomo understands what's going on in the state, though, because of the revenue shortfall that's really putting a squeeze on the state's budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  $2 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then when you see 25,000 jobs that were heading into New York city from Amazon just disappear overnight because of some 20-something congresswoman who doesn't understand how the unemployment rate is even calculated, that sends shivers through the spines of politicians, whether they're right or left.</p><p>EZRATI:  Well, I think Cuomo knows.  And I think he realizes his back's against the wall.  I can' answer for de Blasio.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is he going to do.  What is Governor Cuomo going to do?  If his back is up against the wall and you've got all of this, you know, uncertainty and concern over taxes, will he actually lower taxes?</p><p>EZRATI:  Oh, I don't think he's going to lower taxes.  I think his first move is to try to cut spending.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And do more deals with technology companies?  Google is huge, huge employer in New York City and growing.  They're just not going to publicize any kind of deals that they make with these corporations.  They're going to say keep it on the  QT, we're not going to make some big marketing splash with it.  Otherwise, you know who will be tweeting about it, tweeting idiocy which I know what we're going to talk about with Karl Rove.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Karl Rove's out with a good op-ed --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The New Deal was racist.  That's her -- that was her latest thing down at South by Southwest.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll talk about that.</p><p>Milton -- thank you so much.</p><p>EZRATI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Milton Ezrati there.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted, here's what he said.  \"My administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale trade deal with the United Kingdom, the potential is unlimited.\"</p><p>Once the President gets beyond China it's Europe that he's going to focus on and obviously U.K. is priority there.  We'll talk about that coming up.</p><p>Then 2020 vision, Beto O'Rourke officially announcing his presidential bid.  The political implications for an already crowded Democratic field right after this.</p><p>Then a letter of friendship -- one British girl's message to European Council President Donald Tusk going viral.  The message as the U.K. Prepares to leave the E.U. coming up.  Right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 14th.  Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Grounded, President Trump keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked.  The president making the decision last night, one travel website will now let fliers pick their plane before booking a ticket so they can avoid a 737 Max.</p><p>Markets this morning are lower.

Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke officially announcing his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), FORMER CONGRESSMAN, TEXAS:  Amy and I are happy to share with you that I'm running to serve you as the next president of the United States of America.  This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is former Arkansas governor and former Republican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee.  Governor, good so you this morning.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER GOVERNOR, ARKANSAS:  Well, good morning, Maria, great to be with you.  You know, Beto is off to an interesting start.  I would say a couple of observations.  Number one, from a production standpoint, his opening video was about seven minutes too long for a single shot.  You know, and I'm just looking at it strictly from a production standpoint.  His wife was holding his left hand.  She should have been holding both of them, because his right was overly animated for a tight shot.  So that's the production value.</p><p>Now, here's the one to the Republicans, don't take this guy lightly.  I believe people will do that at their own peril.  He's very attractive candidate from the standpoint that he's got charisma and we can make fun of him and saying he's the skateboard candidate, he's all of those things.  But he's articulate, he's good looking, he has a catchy name.</p><p>And I don't know if people remember back in 2008, but there was a guy who had been a really non-descript state senator in Illinois, that had never accomplished anything or passed a single bill, was pretty much a non-player in the U.S. Senate but he made a great speech one time at the Democratic convention and he went on to defeat the heir apparent, Hillary Clinton and became president for eight years.  So, to Republicans who say, don't worry about this.  I'd say Democrats have a history of reaching out and picking a guy that nobody thought had a shot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  By the way, where did the name Beto come from?  Karl Rove in his op-ed this morning writes that his real name is Robert Francis.  So, we're going to talk to Karl Rove, coming up.  But, I'm just saying.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, I mean, it's a name that he took, it has a Hispanic sound to it.  But he's basically of Irish descent.  But I mean, if you're in South Texas, saying you're Irish probably doesn't win you a lot of votes.  And if you can identify as Hispanic, I'm sure that's a better move in Texas.</p><p>But let's remember how close he came in a very blue state like Texas to becoming a senator, against an incumbent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That was pretty impressive to be honest.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You say Texas is a blue state.  Not yet.  Governor, you said Texas was a --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Oh, I'm sorry, red state.  It's early in the morning where I am, Dagen, you've got to remember.  I've just not had enough coffee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's looking purple more and more, right?  It's looking purple more and more by the way but --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's a red state.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a red state so far.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman (INAUDIBLE) is from one of the border communities in Texas.  And then to quote the rider in Texas, Skip Hollandsworth, you've got the People's Republic of Austin.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, Austin, their city motto is to keep Austin weird.  They do a darn good job of it.  It's an anomaly in the state of Texas.  If you've been to Texas, you go all over the state and it's a very conservative state, people wear cowboy boots and they still have manure on the bottom of them.  If you go to Austin, it's a pretty tony type of environment and the politics of Austin very left of center.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, exactly.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, FORBES MEDIA:  We won't get into jokes about manure in Texas and politicians.  But what is the compelling story about O'Rourke?  I mean, Obama, quite obvious.  What's O'Rourke other than he's a good looking guy?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I don't think he's good looking for the record.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, look, let me just say, before you answer that -- before you answer that, the media is on-board with Beto, OK.  So O'Rourke spoke to Vanity Fair yesterday.  There's a big cover story, it's titled Beto O'Rourke, I'm just born to do this.  He takes on the question of diversity in the 2020 election, saying this, I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our president has been a white man and they want something different for this country and I think that's a very legitimate basis upon which to make a decision.</p><p>So governor, let's -- I don't get that quote by the way at all.  But what about Steve's question, what is it about Beto other than the superficial idea that maybe he looks like a candidate and he's got a fun name?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, you know, to go back to the old movie that all of us saw years ago, the candidate, with Robert Redford.  There was a lack of substance but there was an enormous level of charisma.  And in these television days, charisma counts.  And I think he doesn't bring a great resume.  He was a brief time congressman.  He has no major accomplishments in terms of his legislative career.</p><p>But the point is, he does light up the stage.  And there's a connection that he has with younger voters, whoever the Democrat nominee is, remember the main thing they're going to bring to the race is I'm not Donald Trump.</p><p>Now, I don't think that that's enough.  And I think when it comes down to it, the Democrats are going to over-play their hand so far to the left that even some Democrats, the more moderate ones.</p><p>FORBES:  Quick question on that, you may be right governor about going so far left.  What does that mean for Howard Schultz?  Could he become an effect de facto Democrat nominee at least for the moderates of the party?  How do you see that playing out?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No, he won't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't think he'll go on the Democrat side?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I don't because -- no, de facto.  I mean, he'll be as an Independent but he will --</p><p>FORBES:  He might do it but --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- of Democrat votes.</p><p>FORBES:  But he's too pragmatic for today's Democratic party.  He just doesn't fit their mold.  They want someone --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He won't get the nomination.</p><p>FORBES:  But could he running as an independent, would he attract a lot of Democrats who consider him the real Democrat, not the far left loony that the Democrats are likely to nominate.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  If he runs as an independent, Steve, I think that's very possible.  And in fact, if I were Donald Trump, I'd pay Howard Schultz's filing fee and make sure he gets in the race because he would be a big, big plus for the re-election of President Trump.</p><p>FORBES:  Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, just really quickly, the most important thing about Beto O'Rourke is his fund raising ability.  He spent a record smashing $78 million and almost beat Ted Cruz in the state of Texas and a lot of that money -- this is according to Open Secrets, 48 percent, almost $21.4 million of the itemized individual contributions coded for gender came in from chicks, from females.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's really an important point that you're making, you're right, he's a master.  But the Democrats are in general.  Look at Nancy Pelosi.  But that's the point, I think that's the point you're making.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Biden history -- Joe Biden has historically not been good at fund raising.  It was one of the reasons that some people even discouraged him from trying to take on Hillary Clinton because he did not have the money, despite having the support of president Obama and people in the White House, he does not have the fund raising chops that even a Beto O'Rourke does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to get to college admissions in a second, governor.  But do you think that the -- do you think that the ticket could be Beto, Biden?  I don't see either of them wanting the V.P. spot but --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  No.  I think you've got two alpha males --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  See, initially I thought it was going to be Biden president --</p><p>FORBES:  That's a nice name, B and B.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I thought initially it would be the president -- you know, the president going -- Beto going for president and -- I'm sorry, Biden going for president and Beto going for V.P. but he doesn't want V.P.  So, I don't know.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, everybody says that you know, the classic answer is nobody ever wants to be V.P. but nobody's ever turned it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  So, there you go.  I mean, you know, it's one of those things that nobody ever says I'm running for president because I really love to be the vice president, nobody says that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me get -- let me get to the college admissions scandal.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But then nobody turns it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to talk about this, particularly on the heels of the Elizabeth Warren news.  Actress Lori Loughlin posted a $1 million bond in Los Angeles overnight.  Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are among dozens of people as you know, facing fraud charges for allegedly paying bribes to get their daughters into college.  One voice weighing in is Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, amazing.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  It's just stunning.  I mean, the notion that people thought they could keep cheating like this and build this evidently build this huge cheating network in order for the children of the rich and powerful to make it into fancy schools.  To me it's just one more example of how the rich and powerful know how to take care of their own and everybody else just gets left behind.  I think that's wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  This is like gold.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Pocahontas (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, this is -- could this be anymore rich?  I mean, Elizabeth Warren has been under fire herself for claiming that she was a Native American in her college applications and here she is calling this scandal stunning, governor.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, it's different, though, if you call yourself rich and powerful and if you call yourself a Native American.  And so, what Elizabeth Warren is doing basically is she drank a gallon of gasoline and then lit a cigarette.</p><p>I've never seen anybody self-immolate like her in my life.  How on earth does she sit there with a straight face and pretend that somehow the fraud that she did to get her way through was somehow different than the fraud of these Hollywood celebrities?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's absolutely stunning but it's just indicative.  I don't think she's going very far in this race.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we only have a couple seconds left you guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's because she sounds like -- her biggest problem is, she sounds like Hillary Clinton.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  The real news would have been if she came out in favor of cheating in college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  Governor, it's good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much.  Stay with us.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A new crackdown on e-cigarettes.  Cheryl Casone on headlines right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The FDA announcing a plan to ban convenience stores and gas stations from selling flavored e-cigarettes which are popular among teens.  The agency wants to slow a surge in teenage use of these nicotine devices.  And they also are working to mandate third party identity verification and prevent bulk sales for online distribution.  The restriction is now open for public comment for the next 30 days.</p><p>Well, SoftBank and some other investors reportedly kicking the tires of Uber's self-driving car unit.  Wall Street Journal says the group may invest $1 billion or more in the operation.  Sources say a deal could come maybe next month.  The cash infusion would also help Uber attract investors ahead of its highly anticipated IPO.</p><p>Well, despite the turmoil in Britain over leaving the European Union, a 6-year-old girl there has written a very touching letter to the head of the European Council, Donald Tusk.  Sophie wrote this, dear Mr. Tusk, I live in Britain.  I know we are leaving the E.U. but I think we should be friends.  Tusk posted the letter on his Instagram page.  And then he says, quote, we'll always be friends Sophie, little heart there.  That letter was then reposted on Twitter by Parliament's Brexit coordinator who said, quote, sometimes it takes a child to put everything into perspective.  What a terrible waste Brexit is.  So they didn't exactly politicize it but they kind of did at the end but good for Sophie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very sweet.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, choosing your own plane model.  Travel website Kayak is adding a new feature, giving customers more control.  The story up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  With the official grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane, some travel websites are giving airline passengers more options when they book their flight so they will feel safe in the sky.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now.  Lauren, good morning.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  It's all about the perception of safety, how do we let the flying public know that they have some control over the type of aircraft that they're on?  So, Kayak as well as TripAdvisor are updating later this week their search engines and the criteria.</p><p>So, right now, you can search for the price, the itinerary that the flight quality, you know, if you're going to take you're right eye.  And even the aircraft in terms of is it a wide body, a regional or a narrow body.  But later this week, the specific plane will be one of these options.</p><p>You know, we have to look at as we talk about this grounding of the 737 Max 8 and 9, how many are even out there and the answer is not a lot.  72 of these jets are flown right here in the United States.  Two, three percent, that's it, of all daily flights.  Of course, many more are on order, about 5,011 on order but that's it.  That's what's flying in the U.S. right now.  If we look at the three American carriers that do fly this plane, look, you can see there, southwest is the biggest.  They have 150 flights a day.</p><p>So, this is all going to be taken out of circulation.  And you have to ask yourself, what is the cost of this to Boeing, to the airlines and to you, the traveler?  Ensure my trip in insurance company.  They've seen a big uptick in people calling.  And some agents are warning.  Look, if you take flights out of circulation, you might see air fare go up, but the numbers are still very small.  I think the bigger concern and this is something we heard for the first time from the Norwegian Air CEO, asking Boeing to pay the price.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BJORN KJOS, CEO, NORWEGIAN:  They will not (AUDIO GAP) the cost related to the new aircraft that we have park temporarily.  We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Bam.  Can Boeing afford all this?  We've got $7 billion in cash at hand, $101 billion in annual revenue but this is -- Norwegian has 18 parked, 737 Maxes right now and many other carriers as well.  So what is the reputational cost of all of this to Boeing?</p><p>FORBES:  Opening for China which wants to break into that business.  No coincidence there, the first out of the box saying no Maxes in our country, grounding.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>FORBES:  And what about the lawyers?  We haven't even gotten to the lawyer costs on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be a lot of lawsuits.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes, court costs.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Dreamliner when that was grounded, Boeing escaped that pretty successfully a few years ago.  They did bear, I think it was a $30 billion cost.  They did get out of that.  But yes, this one --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I felt that when it came to the downing the Dreamliners because of the batteries.  Just from a P.R. perspective, I thought they handled it much better.  And this, they are sort of like nothing to see here and then 150 people are dead.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right, and then also, what does it say about the reputation of our FAA or at -- I'm sorry or FAA?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Absolutely.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And we used to be the authority that the other countries or at least the flying public looked to make these decisions.  And we were the last ones to say we're not -- we're not grounding this plane.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, we've got a Department of Transportation quite frankly with the Secretary Elaine Chao that's a mess.  We have -- and we don't have a permanent head of the FAA.  They have not ruled on the -- like the flight delays, there are fines that the airlines have not been paying.  Again, rather than -- (INAUDIBLE) but they need to get on the ball in terms of protecting travelers in this country, not just about Boeing but in other ways.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why --</p><p>FORBES:  Let's keep in mind, still the safest form of travel.  Let's not lose sight of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll take a break.  Lauren, thank you.</p><p>Still ahead, Facebook is under investigation.

Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Thursday, March 14th.  Your top stories right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Grounded.  President Trump has announced that he's keeping all Boeing 737 Max jets in the U.S. parked as new reports say the Ethiopian Airlines crash show similarity to last year's Lion Air accident.</p><p>Facebook reportedly facing a criminal investigation.  At the center of that probe, the social media giant's data deals with technology companies.  It comes after a major outage hits Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp yesterday.</p><p>Markets are lower this morning.  Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, down 26 points on the Dow.  That's well off of the lows of the morning.  The S&amp;P is down two and the NASDAQ is now slipped into positive territory, it is up four points.  This after a wild day yesterday on Wall Street when all was set and done the major indices finished strong up 148 points on the Dow industrials yesterday, two-thirds of one percent.</p><p>The S&amp;P was up 19, the NASDAQ was up 52.  Two-thirds of a percent there as well.  In Europe this morning, markets are higher across the board.  FT-100 up 48, CAC Quarante up 35, DAX Index up 21.  In Asia overnight, mixed performance.

And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman, former Republican Presidential Candidate Steve Forbes, and national security analyst, Fox News Contributor Morgan Ortagus.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA:  Good to be with you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.</p><p>FORBES:  Lot of news, especially on the college front.  This big overhang is still China.  Where we get that trade deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  We haven't heard when this meeting is between President Trump and Xi Jinping.  Now the President says they're pushing it off until April.</p><p>FORBES:  And you have to wonder, does this mean they're close to a deal but they're trying to get last-minute concessions and they're planning to seek --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or not close at all.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think you hit the nail on the head earlier, Steve.  It's all about enforcement, right?  What is he going to -- we talked about this on the show just a few weeks ago.  What is Xi going to say to Trump that he didn't already promise in 2015 in the Rose Garden with President Obama?  How do we hold their feet to the fire?  How do we enforce these things?  That's what's crucial for me for this deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the U.S. wants to be able to put tariffs back in place, should the Chinese not follow through on their promises.  The Chinese say well, then we want that as well.</p><p>FORBES:  Yes.  The Chinese are never going to agree to that.  But the key thing is not just the enforcement mechanism.  It's the ability or the willingness of the United States to enforce agreements.  We haven't done it consistently in the past.  That's why this Huawei thing is so important.  We are now going to do it in the future.  I think that weighs more than any mechanism.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And I will quickly point to a great, what they call in journalism, a tick-tock in the Wall Street Journal about this college cheating scandal.  And it all started with one guy, a financial executive who was being pursued on securities fraud charges and he told investigators, oh, I got something much bigger for you.  And he pointed to the Yale Soccer coach wore a wire, meeting with him in Boston, who asked the individual, this coach asked for a $450,000 payout to get a kid into Yale and there, the ball started rolling.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was surveillance, phones being tapped of the mastermind, Rick Singer.  He was recording conversations.  He tried to tip off about half a dozen of the families that he was wearing a wire and that they ought to be careful but again, 33 parents charged so far.  Lori Loughlin out on -- a million dollars bail is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So he was trying to get his securities issues lessened.  He was under securities investigation and that's how he did it.  By saying look over here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People with money can be very, very stupid.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Meanwhile, the U.S. is grounding the entire Boeing 737 Max fleet after the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  Jeff flock is covering the story.  He's live at O'Hare International Airport this morning in Chicago.  Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning.  One-two punch to air travelers today.  Both the storm canceling flights as well as the grounding of those aircraft, the 737 Maxes.  Take a look at the board at O'Hare.  If you see yellow or red, that means your flight is either canceled or delayed.  The grounding of the 737s announced by the President yesterday.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.  All of those planes are grounded effective immediately.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  Latest on the investigation, one, the black box now to France to be analyzed but as you reported earlier, Maria, similarities in the two crashes.  That leading the FAA to say we better shut it all down.  People being rebooked now but as we said, some of the flights canceled.  Now, as you reported also, a fairly small number of planes in the air that are 737 Maxes or at least were in the air.  Southwest, the biggest among them.</p><p>But if you look at the overall fleet, take a look at those numbers, the overall U.S. Air fleet is about 7,000 or more aircraft.  The number grounded, less than 70.  You can do the math on that.  It's less than one percent.  We have the latest number of delays and cancellations and I would say the Lion's share of these are as a result of the so-called bomb cyclone.  Don't like that term, but there you go.</p><p>490 delays and over 1,000 cancellations, the majority of those coming in Denver.  Number two on the list here in Chicago.  We're at least number two on the list.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right, Jeff, thanks very much.  We'll keep following that.  Jeff Flock in Chicago this morning.  I want to turn to the race for 2020 now.  Beto O'Rourke has thrown his hat in the ring officially for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BETO O'ROURKE (D) TEXAS:  This is a defining moment of truth for this country and for every single one of us.  The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate have never been greater.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the former senior adviser to President George W. Bush and Fox News Contributor, Karl Rove.  Karl, great to see you.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  How are you, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm great.  Want to get to your op-ed on AOC in a second.  But first, your reaction to Beto announcing his bid.</p><p>ROVE:  Am I the only one who thinks it's ironic that he sort of makes his announcement in a long interview in a magazine with vanity in its title?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROVE:  Look, it was revealing -- it was a revealing interview, though.  He said you know what, I never prepare my speeches which is why he said he's a reckless guy as a result.  So that's what led him to say I don't think there's nothing more American than taking a knee, law enforcement is the Jim -- new Jim Crow-ism.  We heard him recently in El Paso say, yes, I'm in favor of tearing down all the fences and borders between us and Mexico.</p><p>It's why when he went out to campaign in Texas in 2017 and '18 and went to all 254 counties, he would go to these small towns and give a speech to the local group of Democrats and routinely drop the F-bomb.  And that was OK, I guess, for the hip parts of Dallas and Austin and Houston, but when you're out in Friona or Jacksonville or Cuero, those people are church-going people even if they're Democrats and by god, you don't use the F-bomb in front of polite people.  I mean, he's a little bit reckless.</p><p>FORBES:  So what's the attraction, Karl?  Other than he's a pretty boy and nearly beat Ted Cruz, who had his own popularity issues in Texas?  What's the fascination with this guy?  Should we take him seriously?</p><p>ROVE:  Well, -- Steve, glad you asked.  I've got a white board here.  Some -- for the interview as well.  For the interview as well.  You can't -- he said, you know, you can't hide from whom you are.  And he's right.  And he's got charisma and natural authenticity and a comfort level about being around people and being in the public arena and that will be helpful to him.  He talks in the article about how he is more enthused about talking about what he is for than what he is against.</p><p>And I think it's going to be an important element in the 2020 campaign for any Democrat.  He said I got to have a campaign that looks like America.  He realizes that he's a white guy so he's going to have a campaign and pledges an administration that looks like America.  So we're going to see a lot of -- a lot of women and we're going to see a lot of people of color in his campaign.  He says, I will work with republicans.  I did it when I was in Congress.</p><p>I will do it as President which is going to be unique.  Is Elizabeth Warren going to say, Bernie Sanders going to say, Kamala Harris going to say, oh, I'm going to work with Republicans?  And then remember, he raised $80 million for a Senate race.  The question is how many of those donors are going to stick with him.  But that's a big starting point that makes it -- makes it possible for him to be competitive.  The real question's going to be what's the message?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ROVE:  And we've got a little bit of a sense of it.  It's like hope and optimism, we're a great country, we faced big challenges but we can overcome them.  We'll see how this goes.  The big challenge for him is going to be his Senate race where he got close to Ted Cruz is not going to be like the Presidential race because Ted Cruz ignored him.  He gave him 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 and virtually all of 2018 to go out there and be by himself projecting a message to the voters and only in late September and October did Cruz engage with him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, really?  OK.</p><p>ROVE:  He's going to be engaged with right away by a bunch of Democrats.  We'll see how he handles it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Karl, it's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>ROVE:  Dagen?  Of course it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  \"Here's Beto O'Rourke,\" the challenges we face are the greatest in living memory.  OK.  Not the Great Depression, not Pearl Harbor, not World War II, not the Cold War, not the Cuban Missile Crisis, not the 70s with the Sky High guest, not 9/11, not the 2008 financial crisis.  Down south we say don't spit in my face and tell me it's raining.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes, yes.  This is going to be a problem for all the Democrats of hyperventilating about how bad the country is but remember that helps them inside their party.  There are -- there are -- the core of the Democratic base does believe the biggest threat we have faced in our lifetimes is the presence of Donald J. Trump in the Oval Office.  This is I think Robert Francis O'Rourke's attempt to negotiate around this.</p><p>And look, please, let's not refer to him by the fake name -- nickname that he did not use at Woodbury Forest, that he did not use at Colombia, that he did not use as an adult when he was -- when he was in a grunge band but only started to reemphasize when he ran for the city council in a heavily Latino town, El Paso, Texas.  Let's please refer to him by the name that he appears on the ballot as Robert Francis O'Rourke.  Please.  Let's do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, wait, wait.  He went to Woodbury?  Well, that's an elitist private school in Orange, Virginia.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's that about?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>ROVE:  Well, he was there -- he was there when it was not co-ed.  So -- and he went to Colombia.  As I remember, that's sort of a private elite institution on the upper west side of New York.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he just started using it when he ran for office.  That's interesting because I was just asking the panel about Beto and Robert Francis and why now we're calling him Beto.  I mean, he's Irish, right?</p><p>ROVE:  Well, he's Robert Francis O'Rourke.  Yes.  And look, if you want a want a nickname, let's give him what his name represents RFOR.  Robert Francis O'Rourke.  RFOR.  Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Karl, before you go, you got to talk to us about your op-ed this morning in the Journal.  American history as told by AOC.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  I listened to her speech here in Austin at south by southwest and it is jaw-dropping.  Look, of course, we were going to have her and the moderator immediately say Donald J. Trump is a racist but Ronald Reagan is a racist and why, because he talked about a woman who bilked welfare in the 70s out of $150,000 and he called her -- he didn't call her welfare queen.  Others did.</p><p>But AOC says well, that was racist.  Well, the woman was white.  Please tell me what's racist about that.  And then FDR --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about the new deal?  The new deal too.</p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  The new deal was racist because it expanded, it legit -- it literally gave mortgage relief to white people but not to black people and as a result, the housing gap, the wealth gap grew because of the racist policies of Franklin Roosevelt.  Well, first of all, it is not borne out by the facts.  The Home Owners' Loan Corporation did not expand the difference between home ownership between blacks and whites.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROVE:  And it's just jaw-dropping.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she said it does not -- it does not feel good to live in America today.  I mean, what in the world are these people living in?</p><p>ROVE:  Exactly.  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The America is the highlight of the world.  I mean, particularly now, where you've got this economy that is -- that is firing on all cylinders.</p><p>FORBES:  You know, we're raising money here to give her a ticket to Venezuela.</p><p>ROVE:  Well, you know what, that private charity is wrong.  The government should pay for the ticket to Venezuela.  Please.  Private charity is bad.  It's -- that's merely an expression of the wealthy who have been stealing the money from -- what I loved was she was talking about ordinary people, ordinary working people and her audience had to pay between $1300 and $1600 for their tickets that allowed her to go -- that allowed them to go in. They had all access premium passes in order to go see AOC.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they did and she had a packed house.  Karl, it's good to see you.  Thanks so much.  Karl Rove.</p><p>ROVE:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great op-ed.  Coming up, trouble for Facebook.  The social media giant reportedly facing a criminal investigation now for handing over user data to major tech companies without permission.  The fallout, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Deadly blizzard conditions in Colorado and across the country this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, it's been something else.  Good morning again.  Nearly 3100 flights canceled over two days, most of them at Denver International after a bomb cyclone hit the airport there.  Wind gusts as strong as 80 miles per hour.  Now, the Colorado police officer -- elsewhere in Colorado, a police officer hit and killed while outside his vehicle helping with the car that had skidded off of Interstate 76.</p><p>Now, let's go to Texas.  Small planes overturned in the municipal airport by high winds.  They looked like toys.  Strong winds also a major problem in New Mexico, sweeping a train right off of the tracks.  And then there is some stunning video out of Texas.  Look at this.  Strong winds blowing over a tractor trailer.  And this wasn't the only one.  There's been reports of wind speeds up to 70 miles per hour, causing multiple trucks to blow over.  No word, folks, of the condition of this driver, if he's OK or not.  But wow, something else.</p><p>OK.  Shares of General Electric lower in the premarket.  They're forecasting adjusted earnings between 50 and 60 cents per share this year.  That is below analyst expectations of around 70 cents.  G.E. also says its industrial operations could burn about two billion more cash than they generated in 2018.  There is the stock, actually it's higher in the premarket, 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>And then there is this.  Next year's Major League Home Run Derby winner is going to reportedly get a nice little bonus, $1 million.  That is according to the new agreement between the MLB and the players association.  Other changes coming to the league include a single trade deadline and a three batter minimum for pitchers.  All that starts in 2020.  And those are your headlines, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you.  Coming up, Facebook is under fire this morning.  The technology giant reportedly now under criminal investigation for the company sharing user data with more than 150 of the largest technology companies out there without permission.</p><p>Then game on.  E.A. games reportedly paying the world's most followed gamer $1 million to play and promote the launch of Apex legends.  The big business of gaming, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Facebook is under fire once again.  The company reportedly facing a criminal investigation over controversial data sharing deals with technology giants including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft.  Now, Facebook reportedly gave access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of its users to those tech companies.  This after a major outage hit Facebook, Instagram and WhatApp across the globe yesterday.</p><p>Joining us right now is former prosecutor and criminal defense attorney at the Bianchi Law Group, David Bruno.  David, good to have you.</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, PARTNER, THE BIANCHI LAW GROUP:  Good morning.  And thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the Facebook news.</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes.  This is -- the information comes from the New York Times through unnamed sources so let's start there.  But if there's a grand jury investigation out of the district, it's criminal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  It's criminal.  This is unrelated to any of the administrative action, unrelated to the consent order, unrelated to Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are the implications of a criminal investigation for Facebook?</p><p>BRUNO:  Well, the grand jury subpoenas mean nothing, right?  Because when we talk about criminal, you got to talk about presumption of innocence.  Even for somebody that's charged, there's a presumption of innocence.  And there's even more caution when it's just a grand jury subpoena.  So in the event that crimes have been violated, it could be the corporation generally, could be individual officers, could be board members.  You know, it's limitless when you talk about criminal law.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's not just this investigation.  This is in the Eastern district of New York.  There's also a securities fraud investigation going on within the Justice Department in the Northern District of California related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.  There's the FTC looking into its behavior, did it basically violate a consent agreement that it signed in 2011 over again, shared data that deceived customers and consumers.</p><p>And then also, the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into their behavior.  And what's going on is they keep saying that they're fixing problems, we're not doing this, and it turns up time and time again that they're not being quite frankly honest with the American people and regulators.</p><p>BRUNO:  Great point.  Especially on the consent order.  Because they had problems releasing consumer data before the consent order in 2011.  That's why there's a consent order.  And they agreed not to release without the consent of the consumers.  So the Cambridge Analytica issue is a potential violation and they're still looking at that.  Like you said, that's the California stuff.  But it's interesting because New York is different.  I think the New York investigation is completely different than Cambridge Analytica, which could sign -- be a sign for problems for safety.</p><p>FORBES:  So what exactly in New York is the crime they think?</p><p>BRUNO:  Even Times article itself says we don't know.  We don't know how long it's been open and we don't know what the scope is.  All they know is that these two unnamed cell phone companies received grand jury subpoenas.  That's going to be subpoena duces tecum for records.  So they're probably looking at the agreement between Facebook and the cell phone companies as well as any data that was received in exchange between the two.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  This is totally separate from Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the big tech companies but it certainly adds, you know, more political pressure and more weight to her proposal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they'll break up?  They will be forced to break up?</p><p>BRUNO:  I was talking about this in the morning show a couple days ago.  I think ultimately, yes.  But right now, no.  It would be under the antitrust laws.  They could -- they could proceed under those laws or through new laws by Congress.  That would potentially be something that could affect --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congress will start by putting up roadblocks to additional acquisitions by these companies.  Again, buying up the smaller companies and essentially buying them up and then shutting them down just to own and sit on top of technology that might be valuable and increase their market share.  That would be the first step.  It won't be breaking a lot.</p><p>BRUNO:  When is Congress going to act?  This was in the forefront last year when we were talking about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, they got --</p><p>BREAM:  This is a completely different --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They got many of the CEOs to come down and testify --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUNO:  Yes, exactly.  Zuckerberg himself testified last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  David Bruno there.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Tesla is gearing up for a big reveal.  The company will unveil its Model Y SUV later today.  We will tell you what to expect when we come back.</p><p>And then the college cheat scheme.  Actress Lori Loughlin posted a million dollars in bond after appearing in Federal court yesterday while her daughter was reportedly onboard the yacht of the chairman of the USC's board of trustees.  When the scandal actually broke, the outrage coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 14th.  Your top stories right now, 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Breaking news, we're getting readings on initial Jobless Claims and Import/Export Prices.  You'll see it on the screen momentarily.  Futures, meanwhile, off of the lows of the morning.  Dow Industrials now showing a decline of just 10 points.  S&amp;P 500 is unchanged, exactly where it closed yesterday.  And the NASDAQ is up six points currently.  In Europe this morning, gains across the board, pretty much all morning this morning.  European indices look like this.  Jobless Claims coming out, 229,000 as you can see.  And the Ft-100 is up 41 points.  The CAC Quarante is up 35 points.  And the DAX Index in Germany up 39.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Shanghai was the worst performer, down 1-1/4 percent.  Pushing back on the Green New Deal, top Republicans are calling for a hearing on the controversial Green Deal from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Onto the latest on the college cheating scandal, one of the parents who was arrested, his son coming to his defense while casually smoking marijuana on the streets of New York City.  Wait until you see this.  Then pay to play, a new report says Electronic Arts paid top gamer, Ninja, $1 million to promote Apex Legends, all those stories coming up.  But first, new economic data out this morning.  We've got the Initial Jobless claims number.  Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, looking at a market that is pretty much back and forth, positive and negative territory all morning.  Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  That's right, Maria.  We've been looking at these numbers.  I was just talking with a trader, that's why my attention was not on you.  Initial Jobless Claims, this is actually higher than anticipated.  So, you know, I got to tell you, we had such great news on the jobs market so far.  I'm not sure traders are going to pay a whole lot of attention to this.  As you know, it's a very volatile number week to week, the four-week moving average, 226,250.  We come in at 229,000.  It's a little higher, but not anything that's likely to move the markets here.  Import/export prices, this is a turnaround and interesting, because what we've had are import and export prices that have been declining.  Now, a turnaround, higher and higher than anticipated.  The question here, is the government actually dealing with the real numbers now after the shutdown?  They're still trying to get it together, I think.  And there could be noise in these numbers.</p><p>We're going to talk quickly about Tesla here.  They're coming out tonight with a Crossover SUV.  It's going to be very big news.  The Y, they will unveil it at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 11:00 p.m. Eastern.  They're going to live stream it on their website.  This is going to be a lot of fun.  You can see the stock up here one percent.  It is the sister car of the Model 3, but 10 percent bigger, 10 percent more expensive, and slightly less range.  This is the car that everybody wants to buy, the Crossover, the small SUV, is what's really selling in this country and frankly, across the world.  It will be made at the Gigafactory in Nevada.  That's the plan right now.  But lots of questions, of course, about Tesla, how it's dealing with its debt.  Those questions continue.  That company frankly in turmoil as it prepares to roll out this new Crossover, Maria.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Gerri.  Thank you.  Gerri Willis there on Wall Street pushing back on the Green New Deal.  Eleven house members are urging Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold hearings on the agenda championed by freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Joining me now is Oregon Congressman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member, Greg Walden.  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. GREG WALDEN (R-OR), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I've got the letter in my hand from many of you -- from you and many of your colleagues who have signed on on the bottom line here.  You're urging the chairman to put hearings on this.  Why?  What's the point?</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, we know from history that the last time this happened, Speaker Pelosi told the National Association of CountiesCongress had to pass Obamacare so we can find out what's in it.  We don't want that to happen here.  Look, the American people have a right to know what's in the Green New Deal, the effect it will have on their energy prices, on climate, on jobs.  The AFL-CIO yesterday came out and said millions of workers in America would be adversely affected by the Green New Deal.  Independent think tanks have said it caused out a $93 trillion would increase your energy bills by 22 percent.</p><p>We have a right to know what the left is doing here, what the Socialist Democrats are doing here, and my fear is they're going to cram through Congress like they've done other legislation, not give due process, not give hearings, and all we're asking for is let's have a hearing on this legislation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, we've been poking --</p><p>WALDEN:  Roll out your plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- holes in this plan from the get-go, on this program --</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of the cost.  As you said, $93 trillion.  And also because, well, frankly, it doesn't make any sense to do away with fossil fuels within 10 years.  We've have spoken with scientists and it's -- it can't be done basically.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think that a hearing would educate the people?  I mean the pushback that we've gotten Dagen, right, is that this is just broad strokes.  This is just an idea.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, broad strokes like let's get rid of all --</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, yes, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- fossil fuels in this country.</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And livestock --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which, by the way, if --</p><p>WALDEN:  And airplanes and everything else.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And these are pretty radical broad strokes, by the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  This is pretty off the canvas stuff.  And there would be policy that would follow, we know that.  Look, we're open --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, let me bring Dagen in.  Let me bring Dagen in because we've both been really been poking holes in this from the get-go, Dagen.</p><p>WALDEN:  Good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It would hurt the poor in America --</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and lower income Americans more than anybody else.  We use fossil fuel, we use gasoline and natural gas because there are plentiful in the United States and inexpensive, number one.  We are not a nation, given its size, that we can get around places on light rail.  We saw the boondoggle out in California --</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- which, again, has basically -- most of it has been shelved, the light rail project, the high speed trains there.  Also, we're a leader in reducing emissions on the global stage.</p><p>WALDEN:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In the world in part because of natural gas.  Emissions since 2005 have fallen 30 percent coming out of electric power plants because of the use of natural gas.  So I don't -- again, did she cook this up at the bar late one night before she won her congressional seat after a little too much tequila?  I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Congressman?</p><p>WALDEN:  Well, I -- that's all spot-on.  By the way, we have a housing crisis in my state and in my district, and this would drive up the cost of housing.  You see what's happening in California with some of their radical ideas.  The Civil Liberties Union and others are suing because the impact it has on the poor to drive up the cost of housing.  Look, we have innovative ideas to reduce carbon emissions and deal with climate change as Republicans.  We want an opportunity to put our ideas forward.  , and to your point, by leading on energy development and discovery, by leading on innovation like battery storage, by putting forward new nuclear technologies, we can make the math add up but their math doesn't add up when you're going a hundred percent renewables in 10 years.</p><p>They want to get rid of livestock, airplanes.  My district would stretch from the Atlantic to Ohio.  There's no high speed rail going to get me home and around that district.  And livestock's our number two ag commodity in my district and they want to get rid of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to --</p><p>WALDEN:  I mean this -- none of this adds up.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to be clear -- I just want to be clear about something.  I'm not making fun of this woman's job.  We've all worked at some -- at one -- at one point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- tending bar --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was the coat check girl.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- wait -- right.  Waiting tables.  We're not making fun of that.  But we are making -- we are calling out somebody who's has gotten a lot of attention because one, she's an attractive woman and she's young and she knows how to use social media very well and personally, as a woman, I want her to be better.  I want her to be smarter.  I don't want her to spout nonsense, things that are not true about the unemployment rate in this country.</p><p>WALDEN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how, you know, how many hours a week the average American works.</p><p>WALDEN:  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just learn some facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's be clear.  Nancy Pelosi is not going to put this down for a vote.  I mean Congressman, your letter is urging the speaker to do that, but she's already locked arms with AOC.</p><p>WALDEN:  We're asking for hearings.  We're asking for hearings.  Let's take a look at it.  And what you haven't touched on is the fact the Green New Deal also includes a full government takeover of your health care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>WALDEN:  Read the data today coming out of England about wait times for cancer patients to get treatment.  They're not meeting any of their mandates, any of their goals here.  And we don't want long wait times in America and that's $32 trillion, a complete government takeover.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible.</p><p>WALDEN:  And so there -- this is much more than just climate contained in the socialist manifesto.  And I think Americans have the right to know and as members of Congress, I don't want this thing pulled up quickly and voted on without us having a chance to go through it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  And that's what we're asking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you make a good point.</p><p>WALDEN:  Can't we just have hearings?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think you'll have the hearing?  You think you'll have hearings on all of this?</p><p>WALDEN:  I certainly hope so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WALDEN:  You know, the Energy and Commerce Committee has a record of bipartisan work in these matters and I think there's an opportunity we should have a hearing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>WALDEN:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Greg Walden there.  Breaking news on Tesla, the company is announcing Zachary Kirkhorn the new Chief Financial Officer.  Company also naming a new Chief Accounting Officer.  This just coming out right now with these new appointments.  CFO and new accounting officer at Tesla, stock is up, better than one percent right now.  We'll take a short break.  When we come back, Boeing is battling a major crisis.  The U.S. has grounded all Boeing 737 Max aircrafts.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that when we come back.</p><p>Then the big business of gaming, EA Games reportedly paying the world's top gamer a million dollars to play and promote the launch of Apex Legends.  But first, a special update from the Tennis Channel right now.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report.  For FOX Business, I'm Dani Klupenger.  The Superstars came out to play on day eight at the BNP Paribas Open.  Roger Federer continued his excellent run off form as he look for a record sixth title in the desert.  The 20-time major champion eased past Great Britain's Kyle Edmund in straight sets to punch his ticket into the elite eight.</p><p>Federer moves on to face Poland's Hubert Hurkacz for a spot in the final four.  Earlier, Rafael Nadal barely broke a sweat as he dispatched Philipp Krajinovic to reach the quarters.  The Spaniard closing out the impressive win at 6-4 after just under an hour and a half on court.  And don't forget, you can watch all the action from the California Desert on Tennis Channel.  Our live daily coverage hits the air at 1:00 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the Federal Aviation Administration is grounding all Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes in the U.S.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" to weigh in.  Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I'm trying to put myself in the position of being an airline which has one of these Max jets on order.  After all, there are 4,000 of these jets that are on order from Boeing, so you got airlines all around the world waiting to take delivery.  Some of them are about to take delivery.  What do they do?  Here they've ordered a plane, which is now not allowed to fly.  Do they take delivery?  Do they have some kind of financial accommodation with Boeing?  And this is not going to be fixed very quickly.  The black box in the Ethiopian crash has been taken to Paris.  It was badly damaged.  They have special equipment there to get inside the thing and find out what happened.</p><p>That's going to take weeks, maybe months.  So, it's a very long time before you find out exactly what happened, what is the problem with these jets and how do you fix it.  In other words, you've got all these orders that are going out there and will the airlines take delivery?  What's going to happen? It's the great unknown and I think it's a huge negative for Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's what I got to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  huge, huge negative, for sure.  I think, Stuart, this company is down 25 billion in market value --</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- just since the Ethiopian crash.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pretty incredible.  We've seen an impact, we'll probably see a continued one.</p><p>VARNEY:  I have no idea the financial impact on Boeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  But in the immediate term, there is going to be a negative financial impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  How it works out, don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you'll have more in about 10 minutes.  Stu, we'll see you then.  Thanks so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart at 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>First though, college cheat scheme.  Actress Lori Loughlin is posting $1 million bond after appearing in court for alleged bribery to get her daughter into an elite university.  We've got the very latest there.  And then game on, the world's top computer gamer, Ninja, reportedly making $1 million to promote the launch of Apex Legends.  The business of gaming after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More to that college admissions scandal.  Lori Loughlin released on a $1 million bond and is scheduled to face a Boston judge with Felicity Huffman on March 29th.  CEO Gregory Abbott and his wife, Marcia, also reportedly bought their daughter's way into school.  Their son, Malcolm, coming to their defense while smoking pot on the streets of New York and promoting his mixtape, saying this, \"They're blowing this whole thing out of proportion.  I believe everyone has a right to go to college, man.\"</p><p>Joining me right now, reaction, is FOX News Contributor and \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" Correspondent, Kat Timpf, Former Obama Campaign Adviser and Democratic Strategist, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, Axios Markets Newsletter Author, and FOX News Contributor and National Security Analyst, Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see you, guys.  Well, I mean just the idea that he's on the streets of New York smoking marijuana in the face of this, what is he thinking?</p><p>DION RABOUIN, AXIOS MARKETS NEWSLETTER AUTHOR:  That's not even a misdemeanor anymore, right?  Now in de Blasio's New York, you know, that's just like getting a traffic ticket.  So, hey, maybe his mixtape is hot, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's still --</p><p>RABOUIN:  Maybe it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- not legal in New York for --</p><p>RABOUIN:  No, no, it's not legal, but it's basically like getting a traffic ticket at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  It's gross.  I'm so sick of smelling weed.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN ADVISER AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I was just going to say I can't walk down the street without getting caught in a cloud of weed smoke.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean it's probably going to go -- to go legal at some point.  But the real point is it's not and this guy is sort of sticking his nose, you know, sticking his finger in the hurt by doing this.</p><p>BIRO:  Yes.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  This is what happens when you have parents who will get you out of anything and everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right,</p><p>TIMPF:  And who will do anything for you.  They make you so entitled --</p><p>BIRO:  Entitlement.</p><p>TIMPF:  -- that this guy is saying, \"Oh, I'm going to be a rap star.  I bet you -- \" I mean I've not heard -- and I've not heard his CD, but I do not plan to listen to it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Mixtape.</p><p>RABOUIN:  His mixtape -- his mixtape might be hot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  His mixtape --</p><p>TIMPF:  I just -- this is what happens when you're so entitled and you know your parents will get you out of anything.  This is the way that you behave.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I thought --</p><p>BIRO:  I'm not buying that mixtape at the gas station.</p><p>TIMPF:  No.  I hope his parents didn't spend money on him getting into college.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  They probably buy him weed.</p><p>RABOUIN:  I think they did.  I think this one --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you -- do you think all the students involved are either going to be pulled out or it's too late for that?  I mean they're not going to -- they're obviously not going to let anyone in who attempted to cheat.</p><p>BIRO:  Like I said, pull them out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BIRO:  And send them to military school.  As a vet, I'm all for it.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Well, this scandal's been going on for years.  I think they tracked it back to 2011 to 2018.  So, some of these kids I think are still in college.  Some of these kids probably have their degrees already and have moved on.  Maybe they have jobs in, you know, prestigious firms.  Who knows?  Obviously some are out selling mixtapes on the street and smoking marijuana, but, you know, these kids are -- a lot of them I think have probably already graduated and moved on and really what do you do?  You can't take the degree back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder how the students did in school given the fact they did pay their way in.  Hey, how about this?  Pay for play.  Fortnite, great Tyler Blevins, known as Ninja, reportedly made $1 million for promoting the competition, Apex Legends.  So, he's being paid to promote this.</p><p>TIMPF:  What a life, to get paid for playing videogames.  Everyone else plays videogames to the detriment of their career.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that good for him, wonderful, but I don't think kids should look at this and say, \"See, mom and dad?\"</p><p>BIRO:  That's what I want to do.</p><p>TIMPF:  \"I don't got to do my homework.  I'm going to be a millionaire by playing videogames.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If it works for him.</p><p>BIRO: But hey, if Kendall Jenner can get a quarter of a million dollars for one post on Instagram to promote the Fyre Festival, why not?</p><p>RABOUIN:  And this is from the market's perspective, this was really a great thing for EA.  They were falling behind other video game makers.  Fortnite has really sucked all the air out of the videogame space and this really got EA back on top.  I think they've got about 50 million users playing this game right now, which was the biggest launch in I think a long time, at least since Fortnite's been out.  And their stock has really responded as a result, so.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I'm a capitalist.  I'm all for people making money, whether it's through promoting videogames, reality T.V., like, you know, whatever.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Whatever, as long as you're making money, I'm not into socialism and free everything.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, speaking of making money, listen to this.  There are now more wealthy households in the United States equivalent to the entire population of Sweden.  Last year, more than 10.2 million households saw a net worth of $1 million to $5 million breaking a new record, according to a spectrum group survey.  Pretty good stuff that you're seeing --</p><p>BIRO:  Awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- so many millionaires in the U.S. and people lift out of poverty.  That's capitalism.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Absolutely.  It's a great thing.  It's so hip to sort of demonize people for being successful, but that's not what this country is supposed to be out -- about.  I don't understand where we reached the point where successful equals bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>TIMPF:  And, no, that's a great thing.  It's a wonderful thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what do you think about this whole debate about capitalism versus socialism?  Good op-ed in The Journal today by Dan Henninger, socialism, yes, be afraid.</p><p>TIMPF:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts.  Dion.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Look, I don't know that socialism is coming to America.  And, again, there are lots of different types of socialism.  There's -- you've got Bernie on the left saying he wants Democratic Socialism, which it's important to point out is very different from what's happening in Venezuela and the situation there.  You've also got places like Norway that have socialism, you've got Chile who had a socialist president.  So, what that means is there's a lot of different things.  I think a lot of people are quick to point at something and call it socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's be clear --</p><p>RABOUIN:  It's a broad spectrum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- this is federal -- this is a federal takeover of certain industries.  And that's what Medicare For All is.</p><p>RABOUIN:  But that's not what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what this Green New Deal is.  So, these are socialist policies.</p><p>BIRO:  I'm a little interested to see Nancy Pelosi herself pushing back on some of these.  Basically with the Green Deal she kind of said, \"Yes, that's cute,\" and just moved on.  So, as a Democrat myself I was a little but relieved because I'm scared.  I'm more of the, you know, I'm a Southern Democrat so this socialism stuff kind of scares me a little bit, honestly.</p><p>TIMPF:  There's no doubt that the polling shows that Millennials and Generation Z are more in favor of socialism than any other generation.</p><p>BIRO:  Right.</p><p>TIMPF:  I just don't think they totally understand what it is.  They think it's wearing like a Che Guevara T-shirt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you're right.  Great Millennial panel, guys.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.</p><p>RABOUIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Appreciate it.  Kat Timpf, Robin Biro, Dion Rabouin, and Morgan Ortagus.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show.  Dagen, Steve, Morgan, thank you.</p><p>FORBES:  Thank you.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Have a great day, everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2191398610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-09R1-JBHT-D0R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23257\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

The New York Times seems to think he's made a deal with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as part of the grand plan. Times media columnist Ben Smith speculated [1]about a deal that might have been made between Trump and Zuckerberg at a dinner that took place in November 2019. Smith claimed that he had received details from unnamed Facebook and White House officials about the details of that dinner. </p><p>Of course, Smith qualified his queries, stating, '[I]t's hard to imagine that anyone \u2014 certainly not Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 would be dumb enough to make a secret deal with a president known for keeping neither secrets nor deals.' The piece painted a dark picture for Facebook: 'Democrats hate and distrust [Facebook] because they spread right-wing misinformation and helped elect Donald Trump.' Meanwhile, the conservative problems with Facebook were whitewashed: 'Republicans hate and distrust [Facebook] because they're run by California liberals and delete some right-wing speech.' Smith wondered what agreement the two reached during that dinner, saying, 'Mr. Zuckerberg needs, and appears to be getting, a pass both on angry tweets from the president and the serious threats of lawsuits and regulation that face other big tech companies.'Times tech reporter Cecilia Kang threw in her two cents, asking in a tweet[2]: '[I]t's clear it's also playing the short game on Trump. Where does that leave FB w/ a potential Biden 2020 win?' An early Facebook investor, Roger McNamee, stated in the piece, 'Trump needs Facebook's thumb on the scale to win this election.' And a former Democratic policy communications Facebook employee, Nu Wexler, was quoted as saying, '[C]ompanies should be worried about Democrats as well. The days of just keeping the president happy are over.' NBC Senior Media Reporter Dylan Byers noted in his daily 'Byers Market' newsletter[3], 'Fair to wonder, but Smith doesn't actually have any evidence of a secret deal.'

As the Joe and Betty Anderlik Fellow, her coverage on tech censorship, media bias, and pro-life issues have been cited by many in the conservative movement.

We're pleased to announce that this fast-moving beat will soon be in the expert hands of Cecilia Kang, who for the past seven years has covered regulatory, legislative and tech policy issues at The Washington Post.&lt;nl/&gt; Cecilia, the Post's senior technology correspondent, has written about net neutrality, online privacy, the on-demand economy, the digital divide, education technology, and much more. She wrote a series of stories about big tech companies allowing in-app purchases by children, which spurred an FTC investigation, charges last year against Apple, Google and Amazon for deceptive practices, and a tightening of rules governing those purchases.&lt;nl/&gt; Upshot's Neil Irwin, who worked with Cecilia at The Post, describes her as 'a stone-cold pro' who has owned her beat by 'combining subject area knowledge, sourcing and hard work.'&lt;nl/&gt; Cecilia will be based in Washington and report to the tech cluster, while also working closely with Bill Brink from media and Elisabeth Bumiller from the Washington bureau&lt;nl/&gt; Cecilia has been at The Post since 2006, previously working at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the San Jose Mercury News (where our own Vindu Goel was her editor) and AP-Dow Jones in South Korea, where she covered the Asian financial crisis as both an editor and a reporter.&lt;nl/&gt; A child of Korean immigrants, Cecilia says her first job was to fill ketchup bottles and napkin dispensers at the family's burger joint in Seattle. She was promoted when the family took over an ice cream shop and assigned Cecilia to the frozen banana dipping station. But her career in food ended abruptly, she says, when another employee (her sister) said she found a hair in the chopped nut tray.&lt;nl/&gt; 'Journalism has worked out much better,' says Cecilia, who, to this day, disputes the hair allegation.&lt;nl/&gt; She starts next month.&lt;nl/&gt; </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TKBZ10898214438825019591415922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TKBZ-7393</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H2K-DRS1-F03R-N0PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><timeReceived>2:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Talking Biz News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 3, 2015 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000DEB4</classCode><className>NASH HOLDINGS LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

From Why Does Apple Control Its Competitors?</p><p>,[1]the lead editorial in Friday's New York Times. Of the 17 most popular screen-time and parental-control apps in the App Store, 11 have been removed or restricted by Apple. The app makers believe they are being punished for competing with Apple's own screen-time control tools, or worse, for weaning people off Apple devices. Many of the apps had more stringent controls than Apple's in-house alternatives. Apple says that the applications \u2014 specifically, the parental-control apps \u2014 were removed because of their use of Mobile Device Management, a technology that gave third parties access to information such as 'user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions and browsing history.' In other words, Apple says it removed the apps to protect the privacy of the children and parents who installed them. The actions by Apple highlight the inherent tension in the company's fierce control over its mobile operating system: On the one hand, the closed environment is a boon to consumer privacy because the company has the leverage to insist upon it; on the other hand, that environment fosters a kind of monopoly Even if we take Apple at its word that it was only protecting the privacy and security of its users by removing screen-time and parental-control apps, the state of the app marketplace is troubling. Why is a company \u2014 with no mechanism for democratic oversight \u2014 the primary and most zealous guardian of user privacy and security? Why is one company in charge of vetting what users can or cannot do on their phones, especially when that company also makes apps that compete in a marketplace that it controls? The status quo is untenable. It's time for American regulators to take a good hard look at app stores and mobile operating systems. It might be time for another United States v. Microsoft. My take: Or maybe not. The United States might have bigger fish to fry right now.

Adam joins us from Bloomberg, where he was a reporter for 11 years, first in San Francisco covering beats including the environment and the entertainment business, before transitioning to report on Silicon Valley's technology industry. </p><p>In 2016, he moved to London to cover European tech for Bloomberg. Prior to Bloomberg, he worked in Washington for Congressional Quarterly. In his technology coverage, Adam has chronicled the ups-ups-ups of Apple when the company was in its iPhone growth phase, and its transition into the post-Steve Jobs era. He also covered emerging tech trends such as the daily fantasy sports industry[1], how A.I. is being adopted in finance such as at hedge funds[2], and the flameouts of high profile start-ups[3]. More recently, he wrote about how Silicon Valley executives are themselves grappling with the issue of tech addiction[4]. Adam wrote for both Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek, as well as appearing on T.V. and working on videos and podcasts. (He turned his own unfortunate moment of internet infamy into a podcast episode[5] about the deterioration of online privacy.) He joins at an important moment for Europe and tech. The region is setting the regulatory pace in crimping the power of big tech companies, with rules around data privacy and rulings on antitrust. Other countries are now increasingly looking to Europe as a model for tech policies. And the region is also a hotbed for A.I. innovation, 5G and cybersecurity developments. Adam, a native of the San Francisco Bay Area and a graduate of UC Santa Cruz, lives with his wife, Nickie, and their two sons in south London. Despite being 5,000 miles away, he remains a committed fan of the San Francisco Giants and the 49ers. Please extend a warm welcome to Adam, who starts soon.

And The New York Times is worried that alliance is crumbling.Democrats scrambled to condemn the company after fallout from a Times [1]hit piece that accused Facebook of working with conservatives and ignoring Russian activity on its platform.. In the latest Times[2] piece, published November 17, the paper wrote that 'The alliance between Democrats and Silicon Valley has buckled and bent this year.'The alleged reason for the general discontent?</p><p>Facebook has allowed 'hateful speech, Russian propaganda and conservative-leaning 'fake news' to flourish.' However, some of the content that was labelled 'hateful speech' and 'fake news' was from legitimate conservative sources, and, in one case, the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee[3].Now Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are criticizing the tech firms that 'cemented millions of dollars in campaign donations' to the DNC.Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) criticized Facebook for its 'aggressive' behavior, and called for the firing of FAcebook employees who wanted 'opposition research' on Democrats. Open Markets Institute policy director Matt Stoller was quoted saying that tech companies were obviously no longer friends to Democrats, but instead 'they are the problem.'The Times added that Democrats felt that tech companies should not have 'bowed to misplaced Republican criticism about bias.' Even though Facebook has systematically deleted Republican political ads, censored pro-life pages, and suppressed conservative news in the trending topics section, the liberal media still claims that any conservative criticism of bias in the tech world is 'misplaced.' Even the Times admits Facebook and other tech firms are aligned with Democrats, but questions the idea of bias.Now without that alliance, Democrats are calling for the platforms to be regulated. Sen.

And The New York Times is worried that alliance is crumbling.Democrats scrambled to condemn the company after fallout from a Times [1]hit piece that accused Facebook of working with conservatives and ignoring Russian activity on its platform.. In the latest Times[2] piece, published November 17, the paper wrote that 'The alliance between Democrats and Silicon Valley has buckled and bent this year.'The alleged reason for the general discontent?</p><p>Facebook has allowed 'hateful speech, Russian propaganda and conservative-leaning 'fake news' to flourish.' However, some of the content that was labelled 'hateful speech' and 'fake news' was from legitimate conservative sources, and, in one case, the conservative satire site The Babylon Bee[3].Now Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) are criticizing the tech firms that 'cemented millions of dollars in campaign donations' to the DNC.Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) criticized Facebook for its 'aggressive' behavior, and called for the firing of FAcebook employees who wanted 'opposition research' on Democrats. Open Markets Institute policy director Matt Stoller was quoted saying that tech companies were obviously no longer friends to Democrats, but instead 'they are the problem.'The Times added that Democrats felt that tech companies should not have 'bowed to misplaced Republican criticism about bias.' Even though Facebook has systematically deleted Republican political ads, censored pro-life pages, and suppressed conservative news in the trending topics section, the liberal media still claims that any conservative criticism of bias in the tech world is 'misplaced.' Even the Times admits Facebook and other tech firms are aligned with Democrats, but questions the idea of bias.Now without that alliance, Democrats are calling for the platforms to be regulated. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who has received more donations from Facebook employees than any other candidate, said that he was 'worried that Facebook would bow to pressure from Republicans.' Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) spoke out against Facebook, saying that it was 'now like every other industry' and that it 'does a lot of harm.'

Then there was the blockbuster report by Motherboard[2] showing how this data routinely ends up in the hands of everyone from bail bondsman to stalkers, again, with only a fleeting effort made to ensure the data itself is used ethically and responsibly. Throughout it all, government has refused to lift a finger to address the problem, presumably because lobbyists don't want government upsetting the profitable apple cart, or because too many folks still labor under the illusion that this sort of widespread dysfunction will be fixed by a clearly broken and unaccountable US telecom market. </p><p>Enter the New York Times, which this week grabbed a hold of a massive data set[3] from a broker, highlighting the scope of this problem. The dataset includes 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they traveled around Washington DC, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. In this case the data came from a location data company that hoovers the data up from apps, though cellular carriers and appmakers alike have been equally complicit. The report is part of a 7-part series highlighting just how big the problem has become, and just how little we're doing about it:Each piece of information in this file represents the precise location of a single smartphone over a period of several months in 2016 and 2017. The data was provided to Times Opinion by sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so. The sources of the information said they had grown alarmed about how it might be abused and urgently wanted to inform the public and lawmakers.While cellular carriers have promised that they no longer sell that data after a parade of scandals, nobody has independently confirmed that claim. Nor has anybody asked what they're doing with the data already collected over the last decade. And despite claims of an investigation at the FCC, there are indications the agency is dragging its feet on the inquiry to help run out the clock[4] on the statute of limitations for carrier culpablity. This is the ultimate cost of regulatory capture: profits trump all else, including basic, fundamental human rights. While carriers and data brokers continue to say this is all just fine because people consent to be tracked and the data is anonymized, it's nice to see the Times point out that studies routinely highlight[5] that anonymized data is far from anonymous. The Times found it wasn't particularly difficult to identify individuals and build detailed profiles based on their movement data:Reporters hoping to evade other forms of surveillance by meeting in person with a source might want to rethink that practice. Every major newsroom covered by the data contained dozens of pings; we easily traced one Washington Post journalist through Arlington, Va. In other cases, there were detours to hotels and late-night visits to the homes of prominent people. One person, plucked from the data in Los Angeles nearly at random, was found traveling to and from roadside motels multiple times, for visits of only a few hours each time. While these pointillist pings don't in themselves reveal a complete picture, a lot can be gleaned by examining the date, time and length of time at each point.The perils of what we're building here should be obvious. And it's fairly obvious that even bigger scandals on this front are waiting in the wings until we collectively demand some basic privacy guidelines for the internet era. This again highlights the myopia in DC policy circles, which have been focused in recent years almost exclusively on the perils of \"big tech,\" while \"big telecom\" gets a free pass[6] despite engaging in the exact same (or worse) behavior.Permalink[7] | Comments[8] | Email This Story[9] [ 1]: <url

Do we really want to give them control of the economy and our money right now? Buyer beware.\"</p><p>He criticized Libra, a digital currency Facebook announced last month that will be managed by the independent nonprofit Libra Association in Switzerland, to grow Facebook's power and influence. That's something regulators and others were worried about even before the Libra announcement, as Facebook has come under fire for issues like its failure to protect user data and foreign actors' use of the platform to interfere in the 2016 US presidential election. </p><p>Facebook's 2.4 billion users around the world positions Libra to be adopted by a much wider audience than other cryptocurrencies. This could mean Libra has a shot at becoming a new default currency like the dollar or the euro, Galloway said, which could have serious implications for the global economy because it would not be managed by a central bank like traditional currencies.</p><p>\"We could have the mother of all negative unintended consequences if we let Facebook establish the new default currency,\" said Galloway, who is also the author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google,\" about how Big Tech companies became so powerful and deeply ingrained in daily life.</p><p>Facebook, however, has said Libra will be backed 1:1 by a reserve of stable currencies overseen by the Libra Association. The company has also said it is working with regulators on the cryptocurrency's rollout, and that it has plans in place to protect Libra users' data. </p><p>Galloway called on regulators in the United States and globally to respond to Libra. He added that if anything goes wrong with the project, it will not be Facebook's fault ---- but the fault of regulators not reacting appropriately and customers who buy in anyway. </p><p>Leaders around the world have already begun to speak out with concerns about the project and American lawmakers have planned two hearings on Libra next week, where Facebook executive David Marcus has said he plans to testify. House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters of California and other Committee Democrats sent a letter last week asking Facebook to immediately halt development of Libra while it examines the project further and considers regulatory action. </p><p>The company has not said whether it will comply with the lawmakers' request, but Facebook did release a statement: \"We look forward to working with lawmakers as this process moves forward, including answering their questions at the upcoming House Financial Services and Senate Banking Committee hearings.\"</p><p>Galloway said lawmakers have thus far done a poor job of regulating Facebook, and that Libra is a chance to course-correct. He also blamed users who have remained on the platform despite its missteps.</p><p>\"I think you're naturally seeing what I would call a well deserved and well earned gag reflex around this idea,\" Galloway said. \"They're trying to do everything right: Set up an independent body in Switzerland, make it a nonprofit. But there's one problem ... it comes from Facebook. And people just are like, 'Burn me a million times, shame on you, burn me a million and one times, shame on me.'\" </p><p>Beyond regulating Libra, Galloway also spoke about rising calls from politicians, competitors and others to break up Facebook and fellow Big Tech giants Amazon, Google and Apple. Federal regulators in June divided up oversight of those companies between the FTC and the Justice Department, paving the way for potential investigations into antitrust violations. </p><p>Galloway said he thinks breaking up those companies is not only the \"right thing\" to do, but it would also be good for the economy. </p><p>\"WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube would all be amazing, independent companies,\" Galloway said. \"If you look at all the big breakups in the past in our economy, three to five years post-breakup, the companies are worth more disaggregated. So these stocks are going to skyrocket once breakup actually becomes a reality.\"</p><p>That would mean happy investors and, in companies like Facebook and Amazon where executives control much of the stock, CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos ending up even richer. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Apple is one of four tech giants due to be grilled by the House Judiciary Committee - alongside Amazon, Facebook and Google - and Galloway is well-qualified to discuss the antitrust issues around all of them   Back in 2018, he wrote theNYT and USA Today bestselling book The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (Apple Books[2], Amazon[3]).In it, he opens with some hard-hitting questions. We know these companies aren't benevolent beings, yet we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives. We willingly divulge personal updates, knowing they'll be used for profit. </p><p>Our media elevate the executives running these companies to hero status-geniuses to be trusted and emulated. Our governments grant them special treatment regarding anti-trust regulation, taxes, even labor laws. And investors bid their stocks up, providing near-infinite capital and firepower to attract the most talented people on the planet or crush adversaries. So, are these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption? Or are they the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse? The answer is yes to both questions. I'll just call them the Four Horsemen. How did these companies aggregate so much power? How can an inanimate, for-profit enterprise become so deeply ingrained in our psyche that it reshapes the rules of what a company can do and be? What does unprecedented scale and influence mean for the future of business and the global economy? Are they destined, like other business titans before them, to be eclipsed by younger, sexier rivals? Or have they become so entrenched that nobody-individual, enterprise, government, or otherwise-stands a chance? Galloway has now written a blog post[4] listing four key antitrust questions he thinks need to be put to all of the tech giants, with a further three for Apple specifically. The first four share a common theme: are the companies now so large that they make it almost impossible for smaller players to compete? Q: Messrs. Bezos, Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, your firms have added greater market capitalization in the last five years than the largest retailers and CPG firms have in total. This is a large portion of the entire consumer economy. If you were public servants, would you be concerned that too many of the spoils are being registered by increasingly fewer firms and people? Q: Your market capitalization per employee is thousands of times higher than that of other companies in your sectors. Do you think your companies contribute to income inequality? Q: Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly every sector, other than big tech and companies deemed too big to fail, has shed substantial value. Instead, since the beginning of the year, your firms and Microsoft have increased in value by an average of 35%, while the remaining 495 firms in the S&amp;#38;P 500 are down 5%. Every firm, sector, and economy appears to have incurred a transfer in value and power to your firms. Should we be concerned that your considerable advantage pre-Covid is now unassailable? Q: Small business formation is at a multi-decade low. The fastest-growing sectors receive scant funding from investors. Why should someone invest in a search engine right now, or a music streaming business, or a social media platform, or an e-commerce firm, given the sizes of your companies? And the three antitrust questions for Apple specifically: Q: Mr. Cook, monopoly rent is when a monopoly producer lacks competition and thus can sell its goods and services at a price far above what the otherwise competitive market price would be, at the expense of consumers. Our information age is often called 'the app economy,' denoting how important apps have become to commerce and consumption. Your firm and Google dominate the app ecosystem, with 62% and 38% shares, respectively. Every media company that wants to reach a consumer online must pay you a toll or rent. Do you think any of these firms believe that paying you this rent is a choice? Q: Apple TV+ is offering consumers $1 billion in original content for every .80c a month the consumer spends on your Apple TV+ streaming video service. Isn't it your opportunity to differentiate your $1,300 phones and fund Apple TV+ from the revenues of an unrelated product that allows you to offer a media product at well below cost? In sum, isn't Apple guilty of 'dumping,' that is, buying market share with unfeasibly low prices? Q: Spotify is consistently rated as a superior music service to your Apple Music, yet Apple Music is growing faster than Spotify in the US. Isn't this a function of you owning the rails, and being able to levy a 30% tax on a competitor while illegally reducing their discoverability in the app store? Galloway supports each question with illustrative graphics. You can see these - and the specific antitrust questions he wants to see put to the three other tech giants - in the blog post[5]. The hearing was postponed last week[6] when it turned out to clash with a memorial service for the acclaimed civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, and is now set to go ahead on July 29[7], starting at 12 noon ET. The coronavirus[8] crisis means that Cook and the other CEOs will be allowed to give evidence via video link.

Apple is one of four tech giants due to be grilled by the House Judiciary Committee \u2013 alongside Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2013 and Galloway is well-qualified to discuss the antitrust issues around all of them \u2026        Back in 2018, he wrote the  NYT and USA Today bestselling book The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google ( Apple Books , Amazon ). In it, he opens with some hard-hitting questions.    We know these companies aren\u2019t benevolent beings, yet we invite them into the most intimate areas of our lives. We willingly divulge personal updates, knowing they\u2019ll be used for profit. Our media elevate the executives running these companies to hero status-geniuses to be trusted and emulated. Our governments grant them special treatment regarding anti-trust regulation, taxes, even labor laws. And investors bid their stocks up, providing near-infinite capital and firepower to attract the most talented people on the planet or crush adversaries.    So, are these entities the Four Horsemen of god, love, sex, and consumption? Or are they the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse? The answer is yes to both questions. I\u2019ll just call them the Four Horsemen.    How did these companies aggregate so much power? How can an inanimate, for-profit enterprise become so deeply ingrained in our psyche that it reshapes the rules of what a company can do and be? What does unprecedented scale and influence mean for the future of business and the global economy? Are they destined, like other business titans before them, to be eclipsed by younger, sexier rivals? Or have they become so entrenched that nobody-individual, enterprise, government, or otherwise-stands a chance?    Galloway has now written a blog post listing four key antitrust questions he thinks need to be put to all of the tech giants, with a further three for Apple specifically. The first four share a common theme: are the companies now so large that they make it almost impossible for smaller players to compete?    Q: Messrs. Bezos, Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, your firms have added greater market capitalization in the last five years than the largest retailers and CPG firms have in total. This is a large portion of the entire consumer economy. If you were public servants, would you be concerned that too many of the spoils are being registered by increasingly fewer firms and people?    Q: Your market capitalization per employee is thousands of times higher than that of other companies in your sectors. Do you think your companies contribute to income inequality?    Q: Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly every sector, other than big tech and companies deemed too big to fail, has shed substantial value. Instead, since the beginning of the year, your firms and Microsoft have increased in value by an average of 35%, while the remaining 495 firms in the S&amp;P 500 are down 5%. Every firm, sector, and economy appears to have incurred a transfer in value and power to your firms. Should we be concerned that your considerable advantage pre-Covid is now unassailable?    Q: Small business formation is at a multi-decade low. The fastest-growing sectors receive scant funding from investors. Why should someone invest in a search engine right now, or a music streaming business, or a social media platform, or an e-commerce firm, given the sizes of your companies?    And the three antitrust questions for Apple specifically:    Q: Mr. Cook, monopoly rent is when a monopoly producer lacks competition and thus can sell its goods and services at a price far above what the otherwise competitive market price would be, at the expense of consumers. Our information age is often called \u201cthe app economy,\u201d denoting how important apps have become to commerce and consumption. Your firm and Google dominate the app ecosystem, with 62% and 38% shares, respectively. Every media company that wants to reach a consumer online must pay you a toll or rent. Do you think any of these firms believe that paying you this rent is a choice?    Q: Apple TV+ is offering consumers $1 billion in original content for every .80c a month the consumer spends on your Apple TV+ streaming video service. Isn\u2019t it your opportunity to differentiate your $1,300 phones and fund Apple TV+ from the revenues of an unrelated product that allows you to offer a media product at well below cost? In sum, isn\u2019t Apple guilty of \u201cdumping,\u201d that is, buying market share with unfeasibly low prices?    Q: Spotify is consistently rated as a superior music service to your Apple Music, yet Apple Music is growing faster than Spotify in the US. Isn\u2019t this a function of you owning the rails, and being able to levy a 30% tax on a competitor while illegally reducing their discoverability in the app store?    Galloway supports each question with illustrative graphics. You can see these \u2013 and the specific antitrust questions he wants to see put to the three other tech giants \u2013 in the blog post .    The hearing was postponed last week when it turned out to clash with a memorial service for the acclaimed civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, and is now set to go ahead on July 29 , starting at 12 noon ET. The coronavirus crisis means that Cook and the other CEOs will be allowed to give evidence via video link.

At a stroke, it drives Oakland's vacancy down (and rents up) to the point where the long-dormant office development market could quickly revive. It's a big feather in the cap of Mayor Libby Schaaf early in her tenure - one that partially cushions the likely losses of two of the city's three pro sports teams.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And, less tangibly but just as importantly, \"it puts downtown Oakland on the map,\" said John Dolby, an executive vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield and longtime Oakland real estate broker who added that such a deal was \"unthinkable a few years ago.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The purchase highlights Oakland's urban assets, including abundant access to transit - the city has three downtown BART stations - and its cultural renaissance. Adding more workers downtown will also likely fuel more restaurants and retail in the area.</p><p>\"Oakland just changed. Wow,\" said Chris Foley, a land broker in San Francisco and Oakland for Polaris Pacific.</p><p>A few small tech companies have arrived in Oakland in the past year, including 99designs, Fluid and VSCO. But government agencies and the healthcare giant Kaiser Permanente still make up the bulk of the city's office tenants, despite its proximity to technology startups with thousands of workers just a few miles away in San Francisco. The first big, tech-oriented deal was always going to be the hardest. But spillover demand and the availability of a big chunk of new office space created something unprecedented.</p><p>\"Everyone expected something to happen,\" said Dolby. \"It happened a lot quicker than people anticipated.\"</p><p>Terms of the purchase deal weren't disclosed. Uber's commitment to Oakland continues the trend of the latest wave of tech giants such as Twitter and Salesforce.com picking urban settings over the traditional suburban parks in Silicon Valley favored by earlier titans like Apple and Google.</p><p>But a tech company of Uber's magnitude, with a $50 billion valuation, has never picked Oakland, until now. The company is more than 12 times more valuable on paper than Oakland's biggest tech tenant - Pandora Media - and it's exponentially larger than Ask.com, a unit of IAC/InterActiveCorp.</p><p>Does development now pencil?</p><p>Oakland's central business district had a vacancy rate of 6.7 percent, or 1.1 million square feet in the third quarter, according to Avison Young. With the Uber deal at Uptown Station, that figure falls below 6 percent, a low that rivals that of San Francisco. The city's rent of around $36 per square foot remains about half of San Francisco's $70 per square foot, but that number is rising as availability shrinks.</p><p>With office rents increasing and low vacancy, the environment seems ripe in Oakland for new office construction, something that hasn't happened since 2100 Franklin St. opened in 2008 and sat vacant for a year.</p><p>Shorenstein Properties currently controls the entitlements for 601 City Center, an office development that has been approved for a decade but hasn't broken ground. At 24 stories and around 600,000 square feet, it would be almost twice as large as Uptown Station and could satiate the space needs of another big company.</p><p>Not everyone will welcome Uber's move. The company has been criticized for its treatment of employees and defiance of local regulations. And tech workers have been blamed for driving up housing prices and gentrifying neighborhoods across the Bay area.</p><p>Uber's arrival with 2,000 to 3,000 employees when the building's renovation is completed in 2017 will heighten Oakland's challenge of attracting investment while protecting the city's cultural fabric and poorer residents. That debate has echoed across the city around a proposed Lake Merritt tower and potential coal shipments at the city's former army base.</p><p>For Uber, the deal is a signal that its massive growth shows no sign of braking. The ride-app company already has about a half-million square feet of space rented across three buildings on Market Street and another 423,000 square feet that will open in its new Mission Bay headquarters by 2017.</p><p>Now it's added the centerpiece of Oakland's Uptown neighborhood. In recent years, the neighborhood has seen the revitalization of landmarks like the Fox Theatre and new housing built by real estate giants like Forest City.</p><p>Uptown Station sits on top of the 19th Street BART Station, adding to its lure for Uber, which stresses the needs for access to public transit to avoid clogged bridges and highways. It'll also be packed with amenities, like a rooftop strewn with picnic tables and fire pits for workers. About 50,000 square feet on the ground floor will have a large food hall and retail space. Gensler, which recently opened an office across the street from the project, is the architect for the renovation.</p><p>Big gamble pays off</p><p>It's hard to overestimate how huge a win this is for Menlo Park-based developer Lane Partners. It bought the failing Sears building at 19th and Broadway last year for $25 million and has been working in conjunction with Walton Street Capital on a $40 million gutting that will transform it into prime tech space. A rough San Francisco comparison for that bet would be Shorenstein Properties' investment in an old furniture market that became Twitter's global headquarters, now worth $900 million. It's unclear whether Lane will stay on the project as a fee developer until the renovation is completed.</p><p>Uber had been kicking the tires at major Oakland spaces since the summer. Rumors had been escalating about an impending lease lately as Lane reportedly stopped marketing the building to new tenants.</p><p>Prior to Uber's decision to buy rather than rent, industry sources said Lane was shopping the space to tenants for about $45 a square foot annually including operating expenses - 28 percent higher than the average price of downtown space in Oakland, according to the brokerage Avison Young.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oakland has had some of the fastest-rising residential rents in the country, with paltry construction of market-rate housing so far.</p><p>Major residential and hotel projects still sit in the city's pipeline, and real estate insiders have reported that investors are still lukewarm on Oakland. The presence of a globally known technology company would change that, said Todd Vitzthum, a broker for Cushman &amp; Wakefield, before the Uber news broke.</p><p>\"We're five years into the (economic) cycle with continued rent and value growth - why haven't we built yet? We're just at the point to get capital support for projects,\" he said. \"There's a tremendous amount of anticipation on who will move into the old Sears building. If it's a high-profile, marquee tenant, it'll have a very positive effect across Oakland.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Both the event and its name were a nod to South by Southwest, the annual technology-and-music festival held in Austin, Tex., where <person><nameText>Barack and Michelle </nameText></person>Obama showed up as surprise keynote speakers earlier this year. The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version -- the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as ''creator'' or ''innovator'' -- were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy's anthem ''Fight the Power'' and Parliament's ''Flash Light'' across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.</p><p>The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it -- ''it'' being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel ''some ownership, that tech doesn't have to be far away or out of our lives.'' He wants to leave behind a ''nation of makers,'' she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her ''optimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.'' </p><p>  In many ways, Obama is America's first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator's campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama's strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with <person><nameText>Bill Clinton. </nameText></person>He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg.</nameText></person></p><p>  Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration's pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn't seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.</p><p>  South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, ''How Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?'' As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. ''Fixing'' problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.</p><p>  For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We've seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products -- news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)</p><p>  As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can't afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company's user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me ''will have big effects for a long time, and we'll say they started under Obama.''</p><p>  None of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to ''get in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.'' Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. ''In his final months in office,'' he wrote, ''President Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.''</p><p>  I left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential -- and limits -- of the tech world. The White House can't be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because ''by definition, democracy is messy. And part of government's job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.''

The story goes that they were so impressed by their experiences, they decided to host their own microrendition before leaving office. Attendees at the White House version \u2014 the types of people who describe themselves in Twitter bios as \u201ccreator\u201d or \u201cinnovator\u201d \u2014 were told to dress casually, in clothes suitable for a picnic. The D.J. Beverly Bond, of Black Girls Rock, blasted Public Enemy\u2019s anthem \u201cFight the Power\u201d and Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d across the lawn, which was studded with coffee carts, Lego sculptures and virtual-reality stations. Enormous stages erected for the occasion housed a rotating cast of musical guests and speakers throughout the afternoon. As the sun began to set, volunteers handed out plaid blankets so people could stretch out on the ground.</p><p>The event felt like the swan song of the first president who seemed to get it \u2014 \u201cit\u201d being the value of start-up culture. A friend in attendance that day told me that she thought Obama wanted us to feel \u201csome ownership, that tech doesn\u2019t have to be far away or out of our lives.\u201d He wants to leave behind a \u201cnation of makers,\u201d she said. Megan Rose Dickey, who covered the event for TechCrunch, wrote that it left her \u201coptimistic that maybe our country can change and learn to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>In many ways, Obama is America\u2019s first truly digital president. His 2008 campaign relied heavily on social media to lift him out of obscurity. Those efforts were in part led by a founder of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who believed in the Illinois senator\u2019s campaign so much that he left the start-up to join Obama\u2019s strategy team. After he was elected, he created a trifecta of executive positions in his administration modeled on corporate best practices: chief technology officer, chief data scientist, chief performance officer. He sat for question-and-answer sessions on Reddit, released playlists of his favorite songs on Spotify and used Twitter frequently, even once making dad jokes with Bill Clinton. He stoked deep and meaningful connections with scores of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley: Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>Obama routinely pushed policy that pleased the tech-savvy, including his successful effort to keep broadband suppliers from giving preferential treatment to bigger web companies over individuals. Even his tech-specific fumbles seem unlikely to mar his permanent record: The rocky debut of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance marketplace that cost more than $600 million to build and crashed almost immediately after it went live, was later brushed off as a technical difficulty. And his administration\u2019s pressure on Silicon Valley companies to aid its cybersecurity efforts hasn\u2019t seemed to dampen their enthusiasm for him. Obama used his ties to the tech sector to foster diplomacy: Last year, he took Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, with him to Cuba as an economic endorsement of the revolutionary powers of start-ups to change the world.</p><p>South by South Lawn presented an image of America as a start-up and technology as a small-batch industry, full of dreamers and inventors. I was invited to moderate a panel, \u201cHow Do We Fix Real Problems With Technology?\u201d As much as I enjoyed our conversation, the premise felt flawed. \u201cFixing\u201d problems with technology often just creates more problems, largely because technology is never developed in a neutral way: It embodies the values and biases of the people who create it. Crime-predicting software, celebrated when it was introduced in police departments around the country, turned out to reinforce discriminatory policing. Facebook was recently accused of suppressing conservative news from its trending topics. (The company denied a bias, but announced plans to train employees to neutralize political, racial, gender and age biases that could influence what it shows its user base.) Several studies have found that Airbnb has worsened the housing crises in some cities where it operates. In January, a report from the World Bank declared that tech companies were widening income inequality and wealth disparities, not improving them.</p><p>For better or for worse, the last eight years have been defined less by the rise of small tech companies than by the expansion of Big Tech. We\u2019ve seen the second Silicon Valley boom, with companies valued in the billions, including Facebook, Uber, Snapchat, Palantir and Dropbox. Established technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Google have expanded their reach and influence throughout the world. And while many countries have pushed back against that spread, our government has essentially left them alone. (In August, for instance, WhatsApp announced that it would begin sharing user data with Facebook, its parent company, and its suite of products \u2014 news that gave some Americans pause but caused German regulators to intervene on behalf on their citizens.)</p><p>As Obama's presidency winds down, Silicon Valley and Washington seem to be getting closer. Just a few days after South by South Lawn, The Washington Post reported that Facebook was quietly talking to White House officials about rolling out a controversial app called Free Basics. On the surface, Free Basics sounds fantastic: It promises free mobile internet for those who can\u2019t afford expensive data plans. But only Facebook and Facebook-approved services would be available through the app, and the app can collect data on those who sign up, both to increase the company\u2019s user numbers and maintain the growth needed to impress shareholders. The same service sparked outrage when Facebook tried to introduce it in India last year; officials believed it would create an unfair marketplace and the potential for discriminatory practices. Fusion recently reported that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram gave a company called Geofeedia access to information that helped law-enforcement agencies monitor and target minority activists. The close ties between our government and tech companies have led to changes that Farhad Manjoo, the New York Times technology columnist, told me \u201cwill have big effects for a long time, and we\u2019ll say they started under Obama.\u201d</p><p>None of this was mentioned at South by South Lawn. Instead, speakers heralded the power of the tech community. John Lewis, the congressman and civil rights leader, gave a rousing talk that implored listeners to \u201cget in trouble. Good trouble. Get in the way and make some noise.\u201d Clay Dumas, chief of staff for the Office of Digital Strategy at the White House, told me in an email that the event could be considered part of a legacy to inspire social change and activism through technology. \u201cIn his final months in office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cPresident Obama wants to empower the generation of people that helped launch his candidacy and whose efforts carried him into office.\u201d</p><p>I left the event as the gorgeous afternoon unfurled into a balmy evening, still unsure what to make of it. But a few days later, during a speech at Carnegie Mellon, Obama seemed to reckon with his feelings about the potential \u2014 and limits \u2014 of the tech world. The White House can\u2019t be as freewheeling as a start-up, he said, because \u201cby definition, democracy is messy. And part of government\u2019s job is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\u201d But he added that he didn\u2019t want people to become \u201cdiscouraged and say, \u2018I\u2019m just not going to deal with government.\u2019\u2009\u201d Obama was the first American president to see technology as an engine to improve lives and accelerate society more quickly than any government body could. That lesson was apparent on the lawn. While I still don\u2019t believe that technology is a panacea for society\u2019s problems, I will always appreciate the first president who tried to bring what's best about Silicon Valley to Washington, even if some of the bad came with it.</p><p>Sign up for <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine\">our newsletter</url> to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.</p><p>Jenna Wortham is a staff writer for the magazine.</p><p>PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHIP SOMODEVILLA/GETTY IMAGES)<br/> DRAWINGS: DRAWING (MM22); Obama has routinely pushed policy that pleases the tech-savvy.

MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  -- for the country and our only regret  tonight - our only regret is that we didn't achieve what we had hoped to  accomplish.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Now republican leaders are  looking ahead to tax reform and it is official the border-adjustment tax is  now off the table.  Paul Ryan told us last night, I sat down with the house  speaker and he explained why he ended up compromising on the issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We  looked at health care and said, let's make sure that we do tax reform  better and differently.  That is why the house who offered the border- adjustment tax realized that that was preventing us from getting consensus  to get to tax reform and once we realized there is a perfectly viable way  to tax reform without having to do that, we agreed to go that direction in  the sake of consensus so we can get this done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on why he says tax reform is critical to get to three  percent growth to the economy.  Meanwhile, drama in the west wing and I am  not talking about the television show.  Communications director Anthony  Scaramucci making waves after scathing comments he made to a New Yorker  magazine reporter, the fallouts coming up this morning.  We're watching  earnings from the oil joints today, ExxonMobil and Chevron reporting ahead  of the opening bell this morning.  The company is under pressure amid the  recent decline in oil prices, ExxonMobil down 11 percent, chevron down nine  percent.  This is year-to-date.</p><p>Markets this morning under pressure today as well after a record-setting  week.  The Dow industrials set to open down about 20 points.  NASDAQ down  30 points, down two-thirds of a percent.  ExxonMobil just reporting right  now, revenue is above estimates, set $62.8 billion versus 61 billion,  estimate in terms of the earnings -- that was a miss, in terms of earnings  per share, so ExxonMobil had been under some selling pressure, we'll see if  that continues now with this breaking news.</p><p>We are waiting on GDP, we are getting our first look at the second quarter  GDP, it's due out in 30 minutes, expectations call for growth of 2.6  percent for the second quarter and this of course is the first look at GDP.   There will be revisions.  In Europe, take a look at the indices this  morning, the FT-100 is down two-thirds of a percent, the CAC Quarante is  down better than one percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany down almost  half of a percent.  In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower as you see  there.</p><p>Chaos in Venezuela reaching a fever pitch, the U.S.  is ordering families  of diplomats to leave immediately.  Delta Airlines is also suspending  flights to the country.  The search for Uber's next CEO is narrowing.  Meg  Whitman took herself out of the running but it is a new edition that's  taking many by surprise.  We will tell you who that is, who Uber is looking  for to fill that role.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, market strategist, Kevin Kelly,  and political analyst, Kirsten Haglund.  So happy you're here today.  Good  morning.</p><p>KIRTSEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ANALYST:  Oh, thank you.  Crazy morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Friday.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I know.  Trying to can't keep  up.</p><p>HAGLUND:  TGIF, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everything that's going on in just the last week.  I can't keep  up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Drama in the White House, a failure last night in the  senate.  I don't know, so now Obamacare is the law of the land.  What  happens now, Dagen?  It's just -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I suspect that if as Mitch McConnell seemed to indicate last  night that if they even begin, the republicans working with democrats to  shore up Obamacare, it's simply going to mean a lot more money, tens of  billions of dollars, if not running into hundreds of billions of dollars to  shore up these exchanges.  Maybe you get rid of the medical devices tax but  expect the M.D.'s investment taxes to stay in there which a lot of these  republicans got behind.  I don't - I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what's been holding the economy back.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're not going to a single player option which is what some  democrats like the senator from Hawaii, Mazie Hironi - Hirono wants but you  will - it would just be no entitlement reform, no reform of Medicaid and a  lot more money.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MARKET STRATEGIST:  It will just be big -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is what's been holding back the economy.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It will be a big government central plan that will have no  freedom of choice, there's no liberty in it, it's not going to contain  cost.  What it's going to do is it's going to hamper the system even more.   It's going to continue to impact labor, that's why the labor participation  rate, it's going to continue to impact small business, it's going to stifle  this economy.  It is a new around (INAUDIBLE) that's why it's just  terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of this, because of this top story.  The senate republicans  health care bill failed last night.  Three GOP lawmakers voted against the  so-called skinny repeal bill including Arizona Senator John McCain, as well  Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins.  Leaders from both  parties spoke out after the vote.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), KENTUCKY:  Imagine many of our colleagues on the  other side are celebrating.  Probably pretty happy about all this.  But the  American people are hurting.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  I would say to my dear friend the  majority leader, we are not celebrating, we are relieved that millions and  millions of people who would have been so drastically hurt by the three  proposals put forward will at least retain their health care.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump tweeted his disappointment as well, here's what  he said.  Three republicans and 48 democrats let the American people down.   As I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode than deal.  Watch.  We  are watching.  Why couldn't republicans get their repeal passed, everybody  has their own ideas and what this should look like.  What really make me  scratch my head and wonder if most of them all voted for a repeal and  they've been talking about a repeal for seven years.  And when they  actually had the chance to do something, and fix things, they say no.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  You know what's really interesting was, it -- there was so much  that happened yesterday, right?  As we're watching this vote-a-rama happen,  and then, you know, around, you know, in the 5:00 hour, those four or five  senators came, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator John McCain being a  couple of them coming out and saying, this is why we can't do this.  We're  afraid that the bill is going to the house and they're just going to pass  it as is, there will be no conference.  Then House Speaker Paul Ryan came  out and said, no, we will have conference, we won't pass this bill.  I  mean, I thought after that that gives them the green light to go ahead and  say, OK, we're going to continue to move this ball down the court.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And still didn't do it.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  And they still didn't do it, it's incredibly sad.  You know, when  you look at how far we've come over the last eight years to see that  they're there still is not a plan here, that there's still was not  something that the GOP could coalesce around and they are going to pay for  that because they are so divided right now, they're going to have to try to  rebuild somehow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To paraphrase The Wall Street Journal, one of the many  editorials that they've written in recent weeks, the bumper sticker for  republicans running for re-election, it's going to be -</p><p>HAGLUND:  It was just too hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was just -</p><p>KELLY:  They're keeping taxes-</p><p>HAGLUND:  I can't do it.</p><p>KELLY:  They're keeping taxes on investment.</p><p>HAGLUND:  We can't govern.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They can get elected but they can't govern.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the thing is - I mean, they said repeatedly they needed  to do health care reform first in order to get to tax reform.  In  retrospect, mistake.</p><p>KELLY:  No, they didn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mistake.</p><p>KELLY:  No they didn't.  Of course, not.  They could had a bipartisan issue  which is -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should have done tax reform first.</p><p>KELLY:  Tax cuts.  Work with the democrats.  The democrats want tax cuts  and kick-start the economy and then that could have led into a health care  and that would have been easy win for them. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here we are with the Obamacare taxes very much in place and now  they are turning their attention to tax reform.  I spoke with the speaker  of the house last night, Paul Ryan, who says lawmakers can learn from the  health care fight moving forward. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>RYAN:  We think most of all that is important is that we come to common  ground on how to do tax reform so that we can get tax reform done in 2017.   What I and other house leaders who have been pushing the boarder adjustment  -- I still think it's the way to go, I think that's the right kind of tax  reform plan but if it's going to stop us getting to consensus to get tax  reform done, then we don't want that to happen.  Meaning, the border- adjustment, we want the consensus to get tax reform done, it is more  important for us than anything that we get tax reform done because we think  it's absolutely critical for a strong economic growth.</p><p>And so what we want to do is go through and look at the details to see if  there is a viable alternative to a border-adjustment tax.  If there is a  way of doing tax reform that still gets what we're trying to get which are  low tax rates expensing things like a territorial system, the aspects of  tax reform that we agree on, we wanted to make sure that we could still  achieve those things without having a cash flow tax or a border-adjustment  tax.  Once we realize that that is viable, then we agreed we need to go own  a common template and now we're getting our tax writers, the ways and means  committee and the senate finance committee, we have tasked them with taking  on the tax that writing the details of this tax bill within this template  which we now agreed to.</p><p>So getting consensus between the White House, the senate and the house on a  way forward on tax reform, makes it that much more of a viable enterprise.   I feel much more confident that we're going to stick to landing on tax  reform because we have now said we have consensus, here is the framework,  let's go get it done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you need to find revenue somewhere else?  I mean, that  border-adjustment tax - </p><p>RYAN:  Of course, of course.  So the answer is yes to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- is going to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years. </p><p>RYAN:  But the point - that's right.  But the point I'm making is, with all  the tools we have to make sure that we are revenue estimate our tax reform  bills, we take into consideration economic growth effects.  That helps a  great deal.  So from a traditional static basis which is what people  describe it as, this will be a tax cut, but we will be able to do this in  such a way that it conforms to our reconciliation rules, we can get this  passed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you are expecting three percent growth at some point to  take hold.</p><p>RYAN:  I don't think we can get to three percent growth without tax reform.   I really believe the secret to getting three percent growth which clearly  is a goal we can he achieve in this country, regulatory relief, working on  labor supply, you know, welfare to work but tax reform, you can't get the  three percent growth in my opinion without tax reform.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, White House Communications Director Anthony  Scaramucci under fire this morning after a profanity-laced interview in the  New Yorker saying this.  I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to -  expletive, my own expletive.  I'm not trying to build my brand off the  expletive, strength of the president, I'm here to serve the country.  He  then slammed the White House chief of staff Reince Priebus saying this.   They'll be fired by me, I fired one guy the other day, I have three to four  people to fire tomorrow.</p><p>Reince Priebus, if you want to leak something he will be asked to resign  very shortly.  Reince is a expletive, paranoid, schizophrenic, a paranoiac.   Scaramucci then tweeted this, I sometimes use colorful language.  I will  refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for Trump's  agenda, #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.  And I made a mistake in trusting a  reporter, it won't happen again.  Wow.  Certainly he has been passionate  about the agenda.  But this colorful language, I don't know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The White House just looks like a mess.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It -- and it's one thing to - and Anthony Scaramucci, friend of  this program, personal friend of ours, former co-host of Wall Street Week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It just looks like a mess and when it's just the president, who  is tweeting, that's one thing, I think people are accustomed to that.  He  says, he speaks his mind, he, you know, says exactly what he means or  whatever, he feels like at the moment.  But when -- if you bring somebody  in as communications director and this is the way that they are  communicating, I think that you know what?  Everything is going to change  from this day forward in terms of how Anthony conducts himself.  I know him  well enough to believe that.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  And, you know, within the White House though, there are two  things that incentivizing these leaks.  One is the healthy completion  environment that's being fostered because that's how people can wine up  each other, and then the second is the fact that people know within the  administration that Donald Trump pays attention to how he's covered in the  media so people can leak something or, you know, they know they're having  influence on that way.  So that needs to come under control.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAGLUND:  I mean, that needs to come under control than anything. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or outrageous.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  Oh, they are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And his anger --</p><p>HAGLUND:  And so much it would have to do with the management.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's why he's (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And his anger is justified and what he's trying to do to button  up these leaks out of the White House. </p><p>HAGLUND:  You have to be careful not to be the star though, remember how  the president doesn't like it when people in his administration become the  star though.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a break.  When we come back, American diplomats told to  get their families out of Venezuela.  The new concerns ahead of next week's  controversial vote.  Then does Jeff Immelt already have a job?  Why Uber  may be ready to hand the keys to the outgoing CEO of General Electric.  New  name on the short list.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The crisis in Venezuela is growing, U.S. embassy  employee are now being advised to leave the country immediately.  Cheryl  Casone with the story now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  And things have just  deteriorated there so quickly in Venezuela, Maria.  Violent protests broke  out again just days before this controversy election is set to be held.  So  in response, the state department here has ordered family members of  Americans working at the embassy in Caracas to leave the country.  So the  American employees are being given the option to join them if they want,  the employees but family members need to go.  Meanwhile, the Venezuelan  government has banned protests for the next five days.  Despite that  though, opposition leaders have called for a massive march today, fearing  danger, many people have been stocking up on food and have been staying in  their homes in Venezuela.</p><p>Well, another high-profile candidate is topping the list -- the short list  anyway, for Uber's CEO position which is still open.  Uber now reportedly  considering G.E. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt who's going to be stepping  down from his current role at the end of next month.  So The Wall Street  Journal says that Uber search committee has had active discussions with  Immelt. </p><p>Meanwhile, another potential candidate, Meg  Whitman saying she is not   planning to change jobs.  The Hewlett-Packard CEO tweeted quote this, \"We  have a lot of work still to do at HPE and I'm not going anywhere.  Uber CEO  will not be Meg Whitman.  Mic drop for Meg Whitman.  OK.  Well, earnings  coming in just a few  moments ago from ExxonMobil.  These guys, the numbers  actually mixed for us this morning.  Earnings per share missed the estimate  from the street.  Revenue did beat forecasts though.  This is a Dow  component remember, it's under pressure in the premarket down almost two  percent.  We already have the futures point lower, Maria.  So this could be  another piece of the puzzle.  We'll see he what GDP does.  But there you  go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  And earnings really driving the story all week  because this is the busiest week of the second quarter , Cheryl.  Thank  you.  Coming up.  Amazon shares  down as well after second quarter earnings  disappointed last night.  What the report means to the technology sector.   Amazon down three and a quarter percent right now.  Plus, we are moments  away from the first reading of second quarter GDP.  We are breaking down  the strength of the economy estimates, 2.6 percent growth for the second  quarter is what we're looking for.  It's out in 10  minutes.  Back in a  minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Earnings news driving the story on Wall Street,  certainly driving markets, Amazon reported a second quarter earnings last  night.  It was a disappointment, stock is down.  The company posted mixed  results.  Missing on the bottom line but beating on revenue, revenue was up  25 percent year-over-year, but as you see, the earnings were down sharply  from the estimate.  Joining us now, Overtsock.com CEO Patrick Byrne.   Patrick, good to see you with your -- </p><p>PATRICK BYRNE, CEO, OVERSTOCK.COM:  Good to see you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Make America Grateful Again.  Nice hat. </p><p>BYRNE:  Thank you.  I thought you would appreciate it, I thought you might  like Jerry.  Are you grateful (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Yes.  And I'm happy you have the hat on because we  all need to be grateful and you're right. </p><p>BYRNE:  And we don't feel a lot of gratefulness in American discourse these  days, do we? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Patrick, you're a competitor of Amazon.  What do I make of  what's going on in retail right now when you see, you know, online versus  brick and mortar.  We see what's happening to the malls.  It feels like  online is really taking over, Patrick. </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, you know, every putt makes somebody happy.  The malls, 40  years ago, everyone was up in arms, how the malls were driving out the  small stores.  So yes, the internet does have advantage.  I do think the  best model, the one that's going to win overall is a hybrid of brick and  click, the online somehow mixed with local stores which is the direction I  hear Amazon is going to. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure.  I want get to -- you have a big announcement  to make exclusively on this program but first, before we get to the new  shopping option, how would you characterize business right now, Patrick?   We're waiting on the GDP to come out in a few minutes, trying to get a  sense where economy is.  What are you seeing from consumers? </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, I can -- good question, consumers are back, people are  spending.  People are spending again, the online marketing has gotten so  competitive, people are really rushing in to especially or home goods and  furniture, a lot of people come into that and drive really -- I think  distorting the marketing, you know, they're losing hundreds of millions of  dollars.  It's kind of tough to compete with people like that but -- so --  but I think the economy is actually quite brittle, and I would expect once  they turn -- I think that the -- I think that it's brittle and someday --  some quarter soon we're going to start - it's going to start probably  sinking back into a recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, sinking back into a recession.  So, do you think tax  reform moves the needle on growth?  I mean, what is it going to take to get  people spending again, and how soon off is a recession? </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, it's when -- we have a cheap money policy.  They're inflating  the whole economy as they did 10 years ago with cheap money and it comes  to, you know, the high -- any expansion this brought about by cheap credit  ends with a crash.  And that's what's going to happen and some point, there  will be a dollar crisis.  Your guy, Peter Schiff that you have on sometime,  he's the eye who understands it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, for sure.  I mean, the cheap money has been the case  for the last decade.  Now, we know that the fed is about to raise interest  rates.  They already started obviously this year.  You wonder if higher  rates are going to smash any economic recovery that's just gaining  traction. </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, I think it will - it will keep them - when - once they raise  interest rates, we'll stop for this asset, bubble in the stock market and  what's really driving spending as people's stocks go up, they start  thinking maybe they made 80,000 this year but their 401(k) went from 300 to  400 and that they live like they spent like they made 180,000.  And a good  - about seven percent of our economy is just falling from that wealth  effect, it will go away as soon as they stop inflating the stock market  from cheap money. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Al right.  Let's talk about the exclusive, you are making an  announcement on the show.  Tell us about Overstocks' new shopping option. </p><p>BYRNE:  We have just launched the new tab, last night of midnights cars,  it's in Beta, we're looking for feedback, it's an excellent car site and I  have to say I think it's as good as anything on the net.  It got four  million cars, like cars.com and the other trader but in our case you can --  you can -- you can shop using all our technology, find your car, you can  finance it and you can buy warrantees, they - it's the only place you can  finance and get funded immediately online without talking to people.  You  can buy warranty and I think for the first people with online warranty  protection for cars, it's a really killer new site, it's a tab at  Overstock.com. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, that's amazing.  People buy cars online.  How  prevalent is that?</p><p>BYRNE:  Oh, I think it's about a quarter of the market now.  At least they  do their initial finding and one thing that's also unique about ours is you  can -- women are going to love this, you can find the car you want at the  dealer and for thousands of dealers, we're hooked up, we built an anonymous  negotiation tools, you can negotiate with that guy on the car lot without  ever him knowing your name and address and such.  So we built functionality  as well. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  Yes.  Because this is going to overall be  another way to obviously grow at Overstock.  Is this - is this a pivot in  terms of where you get revenue growth in the future?  Is it changing  business?</p><p>BYRNE:  Not a pivot.  In fact, we think it harnesses the technology to  great shopping and finding technology we've already built in a new  direction.  We have 30 to 40 million (INAUDIBLE) a month and we're adding  out the kinds of products we sell.  Our motto today is really been dream  homes for all, we're trying to get people to understand you can really have  a much nicer home than you might otherwise would if you -- if you shopped  through Overstock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BYRNE:  Now we're taking sort of every good home has a garage and every  garage has a car.  So, it's just another thing to your home. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool stuff, Patrick.  Real quick, recession this year or  next year, is that the kind of timeframe you're talking about? </p><p>BYRNE:  Yes, I do.  I think unravels.  It's a big confidence game and once  confidence probably staring in Washington, once that unravels it will hit  the broader economy I'm afraid. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Patrick, we'll leave it there.  Great to see you, sir.  Thank  you so much. </p><p>BYRNE:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Make America grateful again.  Patrick Byrns joining us there  with the hat.  We'll see you soon, sir.  Thank you.  Up next, we're waiting  on the first reading of second quarter GDP.  It's coming right after this  short break.  Stay right here.  We're  taking a look at how strong is the  economy really is.  Then Uber for the elderly, how one company found  success by embracing ride-sharing for senior citizens, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Breaking news, we are waiting the commerce department's first  estimate of second quarter GDP.  It's going to be out in 10 seconds.  The  estimate is for 2.6 percent economic growth for the second quarter.  We  want to bring in to the conversation, Global Economics Editor with The Wall  Street Journal, Jon Hilsenrath is with us.  And Jon, the numbers are going  to hit any second here.  But interesting to note that we are expecting  pretty good growth. </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR AND GLOBAL ECONOMICS  EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.  We're expecting -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are just getting GDP and it is 2.6 percent growth to the  second quarter.  That is very much in line with what people were expecting,  your reaction. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That is spot-on.  Basically what it means is we got through  the first half of the year, with surprise, surprise two percent growth  because we had careful slow growth in the first quarter then it came back  in the second.  You know what we have is an economy that is still going in  a very disappointing but steady rate.  We are now into the 8th year of this  expansion.  There are not a lot of signs that it is going to accelerate but  there also aren't a lot of signs that it's going to end.  We are just  puttering along. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just want to tell you that the first quarter was revised  lower.  The first quarter is now being revised, Jon, to show growth 1.2  percent versus an estimate of or initial reading of 1.4 percent.  This is  not a great number.  This is really in line with, Dagen, I know it's in  line with estimate 2.6 percent.  What they were expecting is not a great  number. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It is not and Jon, again, we  have not grown as an economy at three percent or higher in a decade.  The  entire Obama term, both terms, is anything going on because we see failure  of the health care reform tax reform who knows where that goes, is anything  happening here or even globally that is going to get us at a faster rate  than looking at a second-quarter?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Two things have to happen in the economy.  It's just basic  econ 101 to get is to grow faster you either need labor force to be growing  faster, people produce stuff, or you need the labor force to be more  productive.  Productivity and labor force drives growth.  And if anything  is going to happen in Washington to support that, it has to be with those  objectives in mind.  How do we get people back into the workforce?  How do  we give incentives to work more, to work smarter, more productively?  So  you know, frankly I personally think we spend a lot of time talking about  what is going on in Washington, but a lot of it has to happen in the  private sector.  The vast majority of economic activity in the American  economy comes from the private sector. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND MANAGING PARTNER, RECON CAPITAL:   Jon, real quick.  I am glad you're bringing that up because our tax system  is convoluted and complex and no efficient decision making happening  because of that so if we get a simple tax system more transparent that can  stoke economic growth, can we see numbers that the administration is  talking about?  They are talking about three percent growth; they're  talking about even upwards of four percent growth.  If we get tax cuts that  come through, can we get those numbers that this administration is  advertising? </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think tax can help.  The question is how  much can it help.  And you have to realize that it's going gains major  headwinds.  The baby boomers are retiring.  A lot of people are leaving  labor force.  How much can tax reform change the incentives of people to  stay in the labor force and keep working?  I think it can help.  But can it  get us to three percent?  Those are huge demographic factors at play.  And  then the other question is corporate tax reform, will that give businesses  an incentive to invest more in United States.  And that is that is again, a  possibility but we have -- because productivity is so slow and in part  education of the workforce frankly lagging.  You know, you have to wonder  how far that is going, three percent every other independent analysis that  I look at says three percent is a very ambitious goal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  In fact, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that three percent  can only happen with tax reform.  He joined me yesterday, and we've got an  exclusive this morning.  He said before the Republican Senate Health Care  Bill that he needs to see tax reform.  He outlined how Obamacare spending  directly impacts tax reform.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well you know, I think the Republican Party clearly needs a  victory on taxes the longer they get hung up on this health care debate the  harder it is to achieve that.  So, Ryan and other Republican leaders came  out yesterday with a statement of principles that they have got towards tax  reform.  And the most concrete thing in that statement of principles was  that they're dropping this idea called border-adjustment tax.  That was  another trillion dollars of revenue that they thought they were going to  get.  The fact that they are dropping that suggests to me that a 50 percent  corporate tax, 15 percent corporate tax rate looks less likely now we might  be talking about something in the low to mid-20s. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So again, they're going backward on a lot. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  He wouldn't commit to corporate rate.  I did ask about  that last night.  He certainly is married to the idea that in order to see  the needle move on economic growth.  You need tax reform.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think that he is right in getting to three percent but it is  not the only thing that needs to happen to get to three percent growth.  I  think it helps to move the needle in that direction but he talked about  other things like labor force regulatory reform.  And I'll throw that out  something else out there which is a hot-button issue for a lot of people,  immigration, the fact of the matter is that domestic labor force growth is  slowing.  You know, one of the secret ingredients the United States has  always had to labor force growth is that we bring in people, we welcome  outsiders, we welcome immigrants.  What is our immigration policy and how  does that fit into the need for faster-growing labor force?</p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, PRESIDENT, HAGLUND FOUNDATION:  Jon, Kirsten Haglund here.   You talk about labor force growth and Paul Ryan just mentioned it.   However, we have seen under employment, unemployment rate has gone down  which is great.  You still have under employment people working several  different jobs without benefits as well as wages, really not going up and  remaining stagnant.  And then if corporate tax rate doesn't go down, that  will cause a lot of companies to send out that cash and not take those  risks even more.  So what effect does that play into this labor workforce  that you are talking about?  And how do we improve that situation? </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you put your finger on one big issue is that there are  still huge overhanging part time workers, people have part-time jobs who  want something full time but it looks like, we have unemployment rate of  4.3 percent.  It looks like we are getting to a point in this business  cycle where wages should start picking up again.  The fact that inflation  is very low means that even the wage growth is slow and people are keeping  more of the money they make because inflation, you know, look at gasoline  prices, you know inflation isn't eating away purchasing power of what they  got.  But this certainly is not your grandfather's economy where everybody  who wants a job can go out and get one and a lot of people in jobs that  isn't meeting all needs. </p><p>KELLY:  Jon, real quick.  You mentioned the purchasing power that we're  talking about how the dollar has gone down six percent the first half of  this year.  What that does that doesn't incentivize companies to invest in  property planning equipment because dollars are worth less.  Why stock  buybacks labor participation rates are low, that's why you are seeing wages  stagnate.  What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, a couple points, on the dollar, one is that the dollar  has softened.  But that was after a long period of improvement so we have  to look at it over a longer stretch of time.  The other thing I would say  is President Trump has pointed to the fact that it is kind of a two-way  street on the dollar.  On one hand, it undermines when dollar is weak and  it undermines purchasing power of the current of the currency but it also  helps exports.  We did an interview with the President this week talking  about Janet Yellen.  He said he actually likes a weaker dollar because he  likes the benefits to the export sector from that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon, does 2.3 percent yield on the tenure make sense to you?   You talked about low inflation, the lack of wage growth.  That might be one  reason but that's still based on where it is, the close yesterday still  seems to indicate people are betting on an economy that is slower than 2.6  percent rate we just got. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So Dagen, it makes sense on two fronts and worrisome on one  front.  It makes sense because all these measures of inflation we look at  are extremely low and when inflation is low, bond yields are low.  It also  makes sense because look at Venezuela, look at China, look at Russia.   There are a lot of wealthy people in chaotic places who want to get money  the heck out of where it is into safe assets like Treasury's.  So a lot of  money flowing into U.S. asset markets, particularly the Treasury, because  it is worrisome I think because even though it is raising interest rates,  longer term rates are very low, and that has been making over some periods  of time.  I don't think we are there for another bubble, I think we have to  be looking over the next two, three, four years about the risks of some  bubble showing up somewhere.  Every day, Maria, you are reporting stock  markets at new high, that is -- that feels good, but what point do they get  too high as opposed to new high?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Patrick Burn just told us he is expecting recession this  year or next year, Jon.  With that, we know it's going on in retail as  well.  Jon, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend, Jon.  Jon Hilsenrath, there.  Coming up,  it looks like a rough time for Amazon and Twitter.  But is the technology  dip just the thing you need to get it?  Stuart Varney on why it may be time  to look for opportunities with these declines.  Then, Tesla owners getting  revved up.  The latest with the automakers finally begin deliveries of the  Model 3 Sedan.  Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, shares of Starbucks are hitting over in the  premarket this morning.  The company missed earnings expectations and they  reported the second quarter.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New  York Stock Exchange.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hear, Maria.  (INAUDIBLE)  roasted.  That's actually right but not in a good day.  Not like those  coffee beans that we love.  In fact, the stock has been down five, six  percent throughout the morning.  They had a sales miss, a revenue miss.   So, some concerns but they did have some bright spots (INAUDIBLE) but it  was a miss.  The traffic improved, that's good, right?  That turned from  the last quarter.  And the new CEO, Kevin Johnson, really is looking to  China, long-term investments in China.  That's where he sees a lot of  growth.  In fact, they plan to add around the globe 240,000 new jobs.  I  mean, that is a huge number over the next five years, which includes almost  70,000 right here in the United States.  The analysts are mixed overall on  Starbucks.  It's down 6-1/2 percent.  </p><p>Let's move to Tesla because Tesla which has had an amazing run over the  last five years, will show you a chart.  But take a look here because Tesla  is up just one-third of one percent today.  Today is a big day, we are  finally going to see now the new Model 3, it arrives.  Today is the day  Elon Musk will give it out tonight to first 30 customers which actually are  employees, and one goes to the South Broadcast tonight live on their  stream.  So, I don't know if this is going to be a sell on news, Maria,  because the last two launches, they -- once the rubber met the road, they  sold.  So, that is like the same sort of phrase, I guess.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And looks beautiful.  I can understand why there's all  this hype around it.  Nichole, thanks.  We'll be watching this market.   Amazon also focusing earnings last night, of course, the stock is slumping  this morning, down 3-1/2 percent right now.  The earnings came in well  below analysts' expectations, a big decline.  This is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos  briefly overtook Bill Gates as the world's richest man yesterday based on  obviously the evaluations of their companies.  Joining us now, the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Stu, you see some  opportunity here?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, look, Jeff Bezos has  returned to his former business style, business model.  Takes the money in,  plows it all back into expansion, he's been doing that for 20 years, and  it's been successful in terms of growing the business and growing the stock  price.  This time, we've got a pullback and a serious one, too, $37.00  down.  I'm wondering, I think the question of the day is, will we see  people buy on the dip?  If Bezos is continuing to pursue what was a  successful strategy, of plowing the money back into growth, then you might  see a few people buy on this dip, but so far, premarket, they have not done  that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And people just are not upset that you're not seeing  profit growth at all.  And this has been the case for a long time at  Amazon.  And once again, revenue was strong, but the earnings just not  there.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  Well, they took their earnings -- they took -- they plowed  profits back into expansion which is what everybody likes them to do.   Here's another question, though, will Amazon's debacle if I could call it  that, a huge drop at the opening bell.  Will that translate into further  declines for big tech?  Is it a sign that big tech which has dominated this  market all year, is now about to plateau and maybe come down a bit?   Unanswered questions at this point, but we'll have answers for you in the  next six or seven hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, we will be watching, Stu.  We'll see you at  the top of the hour.  Thanks so much.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right  after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Still to come, taking a ride-sharing to a whole  new level.  How one couple is reinventing the wheel within Uber for the  elderly.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Move over millennials.  One retired couple created a way to  make ride-sharing more friendly for older citizens, senior citizens.  It's  catching Uber's attention as well.  The nonprofit called \"Common Courtesy\"  has a goal of extending Uber's convenience to seniors who don't have a  smartphone or are not well-versed in using one.  Joining us now are the  cofounders of Common Courtesy, Bob and Anne Carr.  Great to see you, guys.   Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BOB CARR, COFOUNDER, COMMON COURTESY:  Absolutely, good morning.</p><p>ANNE CARR, COFOUNDER, COMMON COURTESY:  Good morning.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How it works -- I think it's such a great idea for senior  citizens.  Is it sort of like an Access-A-Ride?  I mean, that's really a  bus that will handle several people, but this is one person in the car,  right?</p><p>B. CARR:  It -- of course, it's one person, with rideshare companies, but  up to three people additionally can ride for the same fare, basically.  So,  we have some that are going to lunch, some that are individual or is more  dignified, we believe.</p><p>A. CARR:  Yes.  And it's -- we call it \"personal transportation\" than --</p><p>B. CARR:  Or as Anne calls it, micro-transportation.  </p><p>A. CARR:  Exactly.</p><p>B. CARR:  So, it's a grading with mass transportation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's such a good idea.  It's a great idea.</p><p>KELLY:  And how does it -- how does it work with Lyft and Uber and how does  that whole process?  So, if I'm an elderly person and trying to get a  rideshare?</p><p>A. CARR:  OK.</p><p>B. CARR:  We basically see ourselves as we've engineered this, as an  intermediary for both Uber and Lyft.  We have systems that are both using a  concierge or a dispatch from our office for those people who don't have a  smartphone or don't want to use a smartphone, they can call a toll-free  number.  There are others who very professionally use their -- proficiently  use their smartphone.  So --</p><p>A. CARR:  We have our riders register with us.  And they get a specific  rider I.D. number that tracks them.  So, some of them can put this system  into their app, on their phone, and use their smartphone, but others just  don't feel comfortable doing that, so they call the toll-free number, and  we schedule the ride for them.  And then you can watch it on the screen to  make sure that they link up.  It's a beautiful system.</p><p>B. CARR:  Yes.  And it has been re-engineered over time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you guys are not for profit?</p><p>A. CARR:  Yes.</p><p>B. CARR:  We are indeed.  Yes.  10 years old.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wow.  10 years old.  How do you -- how do you fund yourselves?</p><p>B. CARR:  Well, there are a number of different revenues.  We hadn't had  not enough, I guess, is the short answer to that.  Anne has been asking  that from the very beginning, but we've created a number of different  revenue streams that would involve, like, a little bit more, a little bit  of an upcharge for the ride, or there are a certain chapters that we have  that also we've taught how to do this, so they might pay a fee.  I guess  our biggest dream and wish is for donations to come into the -- to the  nonprofit to help us from the bootstrap stage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happens --</p><p>A. CARR:  And also community.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What happened when Uber found out about your company?</p><p>B. CARR:  Well, we started working with Uber when they first moved to  Atlanta.  And they were -- they were a little bit standoffish because this  is not their wheelhouse.  And yet, over time, they warmed up to the idea,  and I really believe they love it.  Now, both Uber and Lyft we love.  And,  you know, what -- the thing that we see is that we are trying to expand  Uber and Lyft's markets from -- get this from overserved to the  underserved.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, you're operating -- you're operating where right now  and where do you hope to operate?</p><p>B. CARR:  Well, throughout the U.S., we see no reason why it shouldn't  expand throughout the U.S.  Right now, we're -- we have chapters in --  several in Atlanta, and in Virginia Beach, Wichita, Kansas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.  Great idea, Bob and Anne.  Thank you so much for  joining us this morning.  We'll be watching.</p><p>A. CARR:  Well, thank you.</p><p>B. CARR:  Thanks for having -- OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bye Ann and Bob Carr.</p><p>B. CARR:  Stay tuned.  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The co-founders of Common Courtesy.  We'll take a break and  then we've got final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love my emoji.  Let's get some final thoughts from this all- star panel.  Kirsten Haglund.</p><p>HAGLUND:  I can't wait to see week two with our new Communications  Director.  He better stay on message.  And also happy anniversary to my  hubby of five years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, happy anniversary.  Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY:  The five-year anniversary is the wedding anniversary.  Who would  have (INAUDIBLE) it, Amazon, this is a buying opportunity.  So, I don't  know why you don't do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would be buying it then?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath said these low long-term interest rates maybe  signal another bubble if they stay in place.  My prediction is it's an  entitlement bubble.  The Republicans can't even reform expanded Medicaid.   We are in store for a debt crisis in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not good.  Thanks for being with us.  Have a great weekend,  everybody.  I'll see you on \"WALL STREET WEEK\" and \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\".  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.

The Dow industrials and the Nasdaq  under some selling pressure today after a week that has been filled with  record-setting performance.  Dow Industrials set to open down about 30  points.</p><p>We are waiting on the first look for second-quarter GDP.  The estimate is  pretty good.  It looks like we're looking at growth of 2.6 percent in the  second quarter.  This is the first estimate of the second quarter.</p><p>That is due out in an hour and a half.

That's why they recorded \"Exile  on Main Street\" in the south of France because Keith was living down there.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MARKET STRATEGIST:  Do you know what was really surprising  though that happened is that Amazon is down and it missed.

The Senate Republican  health care bill has failed.</p><p>Adam Shapiro is live on Capitol Hill this morning with the very latest.   Adam -- it was a late night.  </p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  it was a late night -- Maria.</p><p>But as you just mentioned with Mick Jagger, you know, for Republicans you  don't get no satisfaction.  The Democrats are saying sometimes you get what  you need.  And here is what President Trump had to say right after the vote  was taken.  He tweeted and he said quote, \"Three Republicans and 48  Democrats let the American people down.  As I said from the beginning let  Obamacare implode then deal.  Watch.\"</p><p>So who were the three Republicans?  Obviously Susan Collins, she has been  consistent about repeal.  She voted no.  She's from Main; then John McCain  from Arizona and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska also no.  Despite the pressure  the administration was putting on Murkowski to be a yes.</p><p>Now, John McCain issued a statement right after the vote saying \"From the  beginning I have believed that Obamacare should be repealed and replaced  with a solution that increases competition, lowers cost and improves care  for the American people.  The so-called skinny repeal amendment the Senate  voted on today would not accomplish those goals.\"</p><p>But then there's Ted Cruz.  Ted Cruz who says you still got to try to  repeal Obamacare.  Here is what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRUZ:  I believe this Congress will come back and in time we will honor our  promises.  You know, senators are going to go home in the next few weeks.   They're going to go home to their states and they're going to face their  constituents.  They're going to have hard questions of people who look them  in the eyes and say why did you lie to me?</p><p>And by the way, it's not just the senators who voted no.  The senators who  voted yes are going to be asked why did you lie to me -- because the voters  are not going to distinguish.  They're going to say you guys promised to do  this and you failed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  And for people keeping score the House is on recess; the Senate  they come back on Monday and they're going to be dealing with Trump  administration appointments.  </p><p>Back to you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Adam -- thanks you so much.  </p><p>Ahead of the vote, I sat down with the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.  But  I think even though, you know, it was close people didn't think that it  would fail altogether.  And yet last night, with the three senators  including John McCain having come across the country with brain cancer he  votes no.  I don't know.  What do you think?</p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ANALYST:  I don't know.  I think it became  pretty clear that this whole agenda was going to fail when it went to the  House and they basically had no plan.</p><p>That kind of set the agenda for the next three months.  It's just been a  long, slow defeat.  But just obviously it's totally on the Republicans for  not having a plan for eight years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At least the House passed something.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They hand it over to the Senate and the Senate -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They won't even vote on the House bill.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- they couldn't craft something that the Republicans could  agree on.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  And even -- but to be real here, what they were voting on  yesterday, that vote they didn't even have the text of a bill to vote on.   They didn't even have -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was a last -- it was a desperate last-minute -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  I mean how can you govern this way?  This isn't governance.  And  the American people, yes, are going to be upset about that more than  anything else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So now what?  And that was the issue and the question for Paul  Ryan last night.  Key issue amid the headwinds is whether doing health care  first was really necessary.</p><p>Paul Ryan explains why repealing Obamacare makes tax reform easier but they  do have a Plan B, he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Ryan:  There are about a trillion dollars in Obamacare taxes -- the medical  device tax, the (inaudible) tax, the excise tax, the health insurance tax - - things like that.  If we get rid of those taxes by repealing and  replacing Obamacare which was what our bill that the House passed does.</p><p>Then the revenue baseline to replace the tax code is a trillion dollars  lower.  To give you a sense of what a trillion dollars in a baseline means,  about 10 points of rate reduction for corporate rates -- $35 trillion to  $25 trillion right there.</p><p>And so having health care go first makes that much easier.  If the Senate  doesn't repeal all those taxes and we don't get all of that in law what we  will have to do, what we've already decided is our Plan B is those  Obamacare taxes stay on the books, in law with Obamacare.  And if we want  to get rid of those Obamacare taxes we've got to get rid of Obamacare so  that it doesn't infect and harm tax reform.</p><p>So what we are going to do is cordon those taxes off to the side, make sure  that those health care taxes stay with Obamacare and reform the rest of the  tax code so we can keep our tax plans intact to get rates down, to push  expensing as far as we can go, to get to a territorial system and to clean  up the code for families and workers so that they have a simplified system  where we can consolidate brackets and give people a code they can  understand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say that lowering corporate tax is very important to  obviously be competitive with the rest of the world -- </p><p>RYAN:  For all this and passthroughs as well.  I mean that as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- as passthroughs and larger companies as well.  The President  is at 15 percent; you are at what, 25 percent.  Is there discrepancy in  terms of the corporate rate?  </p><p>RYAN:  Look, the House bill is 20 for corporate and 25 for passthroughs.   As you remember corporates pay another layer of taxation in dividends and  capital gains.</p><p>So we are very close.  The question is going to be answered by the tax  writers as to how they can get the tax rates done as low as possible.</p><p>So that's really a question that doesn't have an answer yet because Ways  and Means and Senate Finance haven't written the bill.  But we now know if  there is a common framework on which to do this with that we all agree to  and that consensus right then and there shows how we are making great  progress on getting tax reform done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you sure you have common framework?  Because a lot of  people are saying why should we believe that there is common ground on tax  reform when we just saw the battle, the exhausting battle that went on with  health care?  </p><p>RYAN:  That's a pretty good takeaway.  We looked at health care and said  let's make sure that we do tax reform better and differently.  So we have  had exhausting meetings -- not exhausting.  It means we've exhausted these  points between all three branches, all three decision makers -- Senate,  House, White House.</p><p>We've had meeting after meeting after meeting to make sure we see it the  same way on our common ground.  That is why the House, who offered the  border adjustment tax realized that that was preventing us from getting  consensus to get to tax reform.</p><p>And once we realized there is a perfectly viable way to tax reform without  having to do that we agreed to go that direction for the sake of consensus  so we can get this done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you consider a VAT tax which, of course, is so widely  used cross the globe?  No way.</p><p>RYAN:  We are not VAT tax people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No VAT tax.  Ok.  Because people are wondering where the tax  revenue comes from since there's no border adjustment tax.  </p><p>RYAN:  Yes.  I mean my own view is you throw a VAT tax, you have a VAT tax  on top of an income tax, then we are like Europe.  And that just is a  stealth (ph) way to grow government.  I also think the incidents of  taxation should fall on the individual so that they know and see the cost  of their government so they can keep it accountable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of people are saying six months into this new  administration, the Republicans have the majority in the House, Republicans  have the majority in the Senate and the executive chamber and yet you can't  get anything done.  So what do you tell people who are saying look,  Republicans can't govern -- there was an op-ed in the Journal just this  week.  </p><p>RYAN:  There's so much that we have done here that people don't know  anything about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like what?</p><p>RYAN:  The day Jim Comey was testifying in the Senate, I'm sure you  remember that day, there were watch parties around America.  We passed a  repeal-and-replace of Dodd-Frank out of the House.</p><p>We have passed 270 bills out of the House already.  We passed more bills  out of the House of Representatives in the first fix months of the Trump  presidency than the first six months of the Obama presidency, the Clinton  presidency and both Bush presidencies.</p><p>We have already enacted the biggest increase in border security in law in  10 years.  We've already had a big down payment on our military.  We've  already overhauled the Veterans Administration.</p><p>Fourteen congressional review acts repealing bad oppressive regulations, a  15th one now is on its way to the President's desk.</p><p>We have done more things in the last six months but nobody knows about it.   You know why -- it's wall-to-wall coverage of Russia.  It's wall to wall  coverage on the tweets.  It's wall to wall coverage in countdown clocks and  all this other stuff.</p><p>So even though there may be distractions out there in the media, now  offence, we are here getting our work done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you have done a lot particularly with rolling back  regulations as well.  That's an important one.  And that also does move the  needle on economic growth -- </p><p>RYAN:  Quite a bit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I think it's a fair question to ask, do the Republicans  really want to see this president succeed?  </p><p>RYAN:  Gosh, yes.  Of course we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean look at -- for example, look at what just happened  in the Senate.  Look at Lisa Murkowski.  She voted to repeal Obamacare  years ago and then she won't even vote yes to bring it to a debate -- </p><p>RYAN:  You're asking a House member to criticize the Senate -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>RYAN:  It's so tempting to do so -- I'm not going to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about Rand Paul.  How about your pushback within the House  in terms of getting together, coming together on common goals in terms of  health care?  </p><p>RYAN:  We passed -- we passed a repeal-and-replace in the House in Day.   That bill is done, out of the House, full-scale bill -- the one we said we  would pass we passed it in May.</p><p>We passed our repeal-and-replace of Dodd-Frank.  We have done all those  things that we set out to do.  The two big projects we have in front of us  -- tax reform, welfare reform.  And infrastructure, we are on our way with  that as well.  We're moving our FAA bill which is aviation.  And then we've  got all these other infrastructure bills to follow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Has all of the noise been a distraction for you in any way?  I  mean you're right.  Russia wall to wall -- </p><p>RYAN:  It is distracting to the fact that our constituents don't know all  that we did.  But no, we are sitting here -- we're here doing our job,  getting our work done.</p><p>You know what is on the floor right now -- funding the military, funding  the wall, funding veterans and military construction.  That is what we are  doing right now on the floor.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More with Paul Ryan coming up.  </p><p>But first murder on the high seas -- a husband allegedly killed his wife on  an Emerald Princess cruise ship.  What he is telling police this morning.</p><p>Then Tesla's first mass-market car hitting the road -- a preview of the  Model Three launches today.  That's next.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A Utah man charged with murder this morning  after killing his wife on an Alaska cruise ship.  </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the story -- Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that's right -- Maria.</p><p>So the 39-year-old man told investigators he killed his wife because she  wouldn't stop laughing at him.  The victim was found with a severe head  wound in a cabin.  Witnesses say the man tried to throw her body overboard.   That ship was in the middle of a seven-day Alaskan cruise.  Investigators  were searching for her but he has admitted to the killing.</p><p>Well, it has happened again -- a Chinese group hacking a Tesla Model X for  the second time.  Security researchers remotely turning on the brakes, and  opening and closing the doors and the trunk while blinking the car's light.   They're playing music from the radio.  The reason it told Tesla about the  hack -- the company has corrected the problem.</p><p>And the first, we should say, drivers of Tesla's Model Three are finally  going to get behind the wheel today.  The Model Three aimed at the more  affordable electric market, the price of these -- $35,000.</p><p>A (inaudible) same plan for Tesla's plant near San Francisco today.  And  taking a look at the stock in the premarket -- the stock just slightly down  $333 and change -- watching Tesla today.</p><p>We're also watching this guy -- you know him pretty well -- Richard  Branson.  He is selling his majority stake in Virgin Atlantic -- that is  the airline that he founded back in 1984.  31 percent of the carrier is  going to be sold to Air FranceKLM for $360 million.</p><p>Now Sir Richard He is blaming Great Britain's exit from the European Union  for this move due to the collapse in the value of the pound.  His Virgin  Group is going to retain a 20 percent interest however in that company.</p><p>And Mick Jagger is feeling the angst in Britain.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>CASONE:  Well that is a clip from the tune \"England Lost\".  It's one of two  new songs from Jagger who says he was rhapsodizing about the anxiety and  confusion of the times that we live in.</p><p>Jagger says he wrote the songs in April.  He chose to release them now  rather than wait to put them on an album.  So Mick Jagger, feeling Brexit - - Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Dagen has some issues with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The fled Britain -- the Rolling Stones fled Britain  because of the high tax rates in the late, late 60s -- early 70s.  That is  why they recorded \"Exile on Main Street\" it in the south of France because  that's where Keith Richards was living at the time.</p><p>So I don't -- and by the way, maybe he released these not on an album so  they die a quick death.  That song's hysterical.</p><p>KELLY:  Real quick on Tesla. It's amazing because Elon Musk has even said  Tesla is overvalued.  I don't know why the stock is this high but it is  fascinating because there was a Wall Street analyst that said this Model  Three is actually their iPhone moment when Apple introduced.  He said it's  going to be great for the masses.  So it's going to be interesting to tell  because Tesla has been stable here above 300 for so long.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like that -- the iPhone moment.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  It was a fascinating coverage of the company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're watching markets.  Oil a focus on Wall Street this  morning.  We're breaking down earnings expectations for Chevron and  ExxonMobil right after this break.  That's on tap today for the second  quarter earnings.</p><p>Then, did football player Colin Kaepernick affect the NFL's ratings?  The  main reason viewers were turning off the TV -- straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Earnings the focus this morning.  Chevron and ExxonMobil are to report --  Chevron expected to report earnings of 87 cents a share.  ExxonMobil  expected to report 84 cents a share.  The energy sector in Israel has been  a game changer after the discovery of a massive natural gas field.</p><p>Joining us now, the director general of the Israel ministry of finance Shai  Babad is with us.  Good to see you -- sir.  Thanks so much for joining us - - </p><p>SHAI BABAD, DIRECTOR GENERAL, ISRAEL MINISTRY OF FINANCE:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Minister.</p><p>Israel becoming a big player in the region, inking several natural gas  deals in European countries.  Tell us how important this is for Israel.  </p><p>BABAD:  Well, it's quite important.  I mean since we found the gas  reservoir we have been investing a lot of money and private companies have  invested a lot of money in order to get the gas out.</p><p>It's going to constitute approximately 70 percent to 80 percent of our  electricity in the near future.  And there's a lot of tax regains (ph) and  royalty that we're going to get out of it.  So it is an essential thing for  our economy.  </p><p>KELLY:  One of the most fascinating things I find about your economy is you  have such a trained and skilled labor force and that goes back to how  people have to serve in the military over there.  </p><p>When we look at unit 8200.  You see the alumni that come out of there.   They founded some of the best companies whether it is Palo Alto Networks.   You've got CyberArk, Check Point.  Can you talk about the effect of how  employers are coming over there because of your skilled workforce?   </p><p>BABAD:  So definitely.  I mean you can see what happened with cyber.   Israelis here are 25 percent of your population but more than 15 percent of  cyber investments in the world are done today in Israel.  And then all of  that has to do with the unit you just mentioned -- 8200 of the Israeli  military.</p><p>So there's a lot of innovation, a lot of technologies that come out of the  military and we take advantage of that.  Israel has more -- we are called a  startup nation because we have more startups per capita than any other  nation in the world.  And a lot of that base, a lot of the technology comes  from the military and from security systems.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But in addition to tax benefits which many countries will offer  a manufacturer or even a foreign business to come in and do business there  and manufacture there -- what do you need to offer these companies to get  them to move their operations or grow operations in Israel?  </p><p>BABAD:  So I think it's the innovation (inaudible) and the technology and  the experience and the skills that we have in Israel.  That when people  come and do their R&amp;D and they do the development in Israel they can  actually take advantage of all the knowledge and the experience and the  skill that is there.</p><p>But you talked about the tax benefits and when talking about the tax  benefits, Israel -- we just legislated, we're one of the only countries  that already legislated reform because of the debts (ph) deregulation that  sets corporate tax at 6 percent and dividend tax at 4 percent for IT  related and technology companies which is quite unusual for all companies  that are looking into moving their R&amp;D or looking into moving the IT to  anywhere and Israel is an attractive country to do it so today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've got this new incentive program, right, that you are  using to actually lure big foreign manufacturers to expand.  </p><p>BABAD:  Yes.  Yes.  So it's all part of trying to make Israel more  innovative, to try to get global companies to come in to Israel, to invest  in Israel, to take advantage.  I mean we will deliver the skill, the human  capital, the technologies, the experience and want people bring their  companies and their capital in order to help us to invest to help us to  grow our innovation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I didn't realize it was -- the cyber investments were so many.  </p><p>KELLY:  And this starts in high school, right.  A lot of the -- </p><p>BABAD:  A lot of -- some the training starts already in high school.  Most  of it is already done in the military because of our, you know, our  security needs.  And then -- and from there on they take on into college  and into universities and then to the companies.  So it's a long training  session in which we benefit a lot from.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Shai -- great to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BABAD:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it.

Fox News  Contributor, author of \"Prescription for the Future,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel.   Zeke, good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>EZEKIEL EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what took place last night.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Well, now we can get down to the business of actually doing what  the country wants.  Senator McCain himself said in his statement, you know,  if the American people have said loud and clear for the last few years is  the problem is affordability and quality of care and that's what they would  like the attention.  </p><p>Ironically, I think there's a lot of bipartisan agreement.  And what you  need to do to get more affordable health care in this country.  And that's  where we should be focusing the attention.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But also, choice, right?  Because all these insurance  companies keep pulling out.  People don't have a choice.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Well, on that score, Maria, I do think that there are some simple  things that can be done that can both bring down the premiums in the  exchanges and get people more choice by having more I'm not sure companies  coming in.  </p><p>They need -- what do insurance companies need.  They need predictability  and to get predictability we need first to guarantee them the cost sharing  subsidies that going to be there.  </p><p>We need to give them the reinsurance and the risk corridor so that if they  get a disproportionate number of sick people that they are not penalized.</p><p>Those two things would actually bring more insurance companies back in and  bring their premiums down.  So, I think those are probably from the  exchange standpoint places to start.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, ?CIO &amp; PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RECON CAPITAL PARTNERS:  Wait.  But  that's your menu (ph) -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  From the cost -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You're talk -- you're talking about the predictability.   And the problem is that you don't need to get health insurance until you're  sick.</p><p>There is no -- there is no -- you're not incentivize to do that.  So, just  sick people keep going into these pools and into these programs.  That's  why the insurers are leaving the marketplace.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Let me remind you, first of all, that actually is factually  incorrect.  Let me remind you -- </p><p>KELLY:  How is it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What -- what's wrong with that?</p><p>EMANUEL:  I'm about -- I'm about to tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>EMANUEL:  The individual mandate and the employer mandates remain the law  of the land.  The government, the Republicans, secretary prices needs to  enforce those roles that gets more people in.  </p><p>The reinsurance -- removing the reinsurance which Senator Marco Rubio and  the Republicans did is probably the single biggest thing to drive the  premiums up and to get the insurance companies to be hesitant about going  into marketplaces.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how do you -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  A lot of the places -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- how do you explain then?</p><p>EMANUEL:  Let me -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you explain the prices going up even before the  Republicans did anything?  I mean, we know -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  No, no.  That -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- how the year started.  Arizona was up 116 percent in terms  of premiums.  That was before the Republicans did anything.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Maria, I don't want to get into yelling match with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Absolutely not.  No, I don't want it too either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>EMANUEL:  Right.  The risk core doors that Marco Rubio removed were removed  in 2015 and that's what affected the premiums in 2016 and 2017.  </p><p>Actually, if you look at the profits of the insurance companies before the  -- all this upset about the Republican whether they were going to repeal or  not.  Get rid of the mandate or not.</p><p>They actually have stabilized or actually making money in the exchanges.   So, I think we have a one-time correction over two years.  </p><p>But if we could do the cost sharing subsidies, the risk corridors enforce  the mandate, more target of the advertising.  I think the problem of  competition and the problem of access in the exchanges would be solved.  </p><p>KELLY:  But most people incentivize -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>EMANUEL:  But the long-term problem of -- the long-term problem of  affordability is a problem of getting hospitals and doctors to change how  they treat patients.  </p><p>Not to wait for them to get sick but to proactively go out and keep them  healthy.  That is a different problem, it's the affordability problem and  that's what the American public really want addressed now.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  But, Zeke -- it's Dagen McDowell.   Because you -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and so many doctors come on and talk about this ad infinitum.   And that is an impossible problem to tackle.  Is it not?  </p><p>EMANUEL:  No.  So, I have -- I've actually prepared the president has seen  a memo with about nine or ten things that could be done that could directly  address this problem of cost control.  Let me just give you one of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how come it hasn't -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  We have -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- been done yet then?  </p><p>EMANUEL:  You're asking me?  President -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>EMANUEL:  -- has -- have that memo for three months now.  </p><p>KELLY:  Give us the one thing that you're talking about impacting the cost  control that you -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  Well, there's that one thing -- as I said there are a list of  nine or ten things.</p><p>KELLY:  What example you -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  But one of the things -- one of the most important things is  changing how we pay doctors and hospitals.  Right now we pay them fee-for- service every time they do something.  </p><p>They remove a prostate or prostate -- for suspicion of prostate cancer.   They do a procedure on the knee.  They get paid.  Instead of that, we have  done -- Medicare actually pioneered this, a lot more change in payment,  bundled payment.  </p><p>Putting all of the fees of a surgery together, the operating room, the  surgeon's fee, the anesthesiologist's fee, the recovery time, the  rehabilitation.  Put it in one fee.  Give it to the doctors and hospitals  and say you guys figure out how to make this more efficient.  </p><p>That actually works remarkably well.  Or capitation saying, we're going to  pay this amount for people adjusted for their risk and how sick they might  be.  </p><p>And again, doctors and hospitals could figure out how to deliver care more  efficiently, get rid of unnecessary care, reach out to patients who are  sick.  </p><p>This -- so changing how you pay.  Right now, the federal government has  committed itself to 50 percent of its payment in the so-called alternative  payment model by 2018.  </p><p>If they made private insurance companies do it.  Private insurance  companies who get contracts with the government through the exchanges,  through TRICARE, through the federal employee health benefits, that they  have to do it.</p><p>You will have a big push and the right direction.  That's probably my  number one suggestion and it would make a huge difference.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think the Democrats are going to reach across the aisle  and that these two groups are going to be working together to fix  Obamacare?  What do you think?</p><p>EMANUEL:  Maria, why is the Democrats have to take the initiative?  I think  the Democrats are open.  It really is the Republicans who rule the House,  the Senate and the White House.  </p><p>They need to take the -- but I don't want to get into a second-grade thing  who starts it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.</p><p>EMANUEL:  The fact is we need -- the fact is we need to come together.   There need to be bipartisan approach to this.  </p><p>And again, I suggest that we -- you know, if we put policymakers from both  sides and you put some politicians from both sides in, you could come up  with a 60 to 70 percent agreement on good policy.  </p><p>And again, focus on shoring up the exchanges and cost control and  affordability.  And that is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  We'll see if they can use your ideas.</p><p>EMANUEL:  -- would make the country go forward.  Yes?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see if they use your ideas.  Zeke, good to see you,  sir.  Thank you so much.  Dr. Ezekiel -- </p><p>EMANUEL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Emanuel joining us this morning.  Coming up, a spending  boost for the Pentagon.  We're taking a look at what is covered in the $788  billion health spending bill.  That's next.</p><p>And then Tom Brady takes on a new trial.  Thanks to a glitz online  (INAUDIBLE) had Internet users laughing last night.  Straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Tensions flaring up in the White House.  The  \"New York Post\" is calling the White House a \"Game of Survivor\" on its  cover this morning.  </p><p>Check this out.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is speaking President Trump  slammed him for recusing himself for matters relating to Russia.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.:  It's kind of hurt.   But the president of the United States is a strong leader.  </p><p>He is determined to move this country in the direction he believes that  needs to go to make it going great again.  And he has -- had a lot  criticisms and he's steadfastly determined to get his job done and he wants  all of us to do our job and that's what I intend to do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, White House Communications Director  Anthony Scaramucci under fire this morning after a profanity laze  interviewing the New Yorker.</p><p>Scarmucci railed against leaks coming out of the White House saying this,  \"I'm not Steve Bannon.  I'm not trying to (expletive) my own (expletive).  </p><p>I'm not trying to build my own brand off the (expletive) strength of the  President.  I'm here to serve the country.\"</p><p>He then slammed White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus saying this,  \"They'll be fired by me.  I fired one guy the other day.  I have three to  four people I'll fire tomorrow.</p><p>Reince Preibus, if you want to leak something, he'll be asked to resign  very shortly.  Reince is (expletive) paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.\"  </p><p>Scarmucci then tweeted this posting, \"I sometimes use colorful language.  I  will refrain in this arena but not give the passionate fight for Trump's  agenda.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.\"</p><p>And he said this, \"I made a mistake in trusting a reporter.  It won't  happen again.\"  Real tension going on.  And the airing of the dirty laundry  obviously is happening in a big way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Anthony is a friend of the show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A friend of ours.  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we wish him well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This -- I was surprised by this because it just shows bad  judgment in terms of calling of, you can have that conversation with your  loved ones, your very close friends in private but not with the reporter.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I'm surprised.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or anybody.  If you -- if you like just one or two people in  your life you might curse.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So, there maybe -- I'm -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Smart enough no -- to know not to trust a reporter.  This is a  guide that covers the White House that would put out something (INAUDIBLE)  like this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I was going to say I'm prone to colorful language.  My  mother has worked on me for 48 years.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Trying to get me stop talking like that.  But I would never  speak this way.  I would never speak this way at work.  I would never speak  this way with people who I don't know well.  </p><p>I -- quite frankly would never use this kind of language.  As much as I  like a good additive.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, FBN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Oh, yes, of course.  But --  and the Communications Director, their number one job, communication,  right?  But also -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HAGLUND:  It is clearly communication.  His point, very direct.  But their  job is to get everyone on message, right?  There has been a failure.  </p><p>We've talked about it on the show a lot about how one of the reasons why  the legislative agenda has failed is because they are not -- they haven't  stayed on message.  </p><p>And haven't given a good positive vision to the country for what they want.   That should be the focus of the communications team.</p><p>KELLY:  It starts with the president.  The president, he sets the tone in  center.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's true.  That's true.</p><p>KELLY:  And the reason Anthony he does stuff like this and other people do  things like this is because the president does it.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  And he's going to be -- </p><p>KELLY:  (INAUDIBLE) more presidential -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  And he's -- and right.</p><p>KELLY:  -- and he needs to stay on message and focus on his agenda.  When  he undermines himself especially when it came to the Russia investigation  saying, hey, it was Rod Lowenstein that did it.  And then all of a sudden  he goes on Lester Holt -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  Oh, this is definitely distracting from the Russia story.</p><p>KELLY:  -- and said -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  No, I'm just saying.</p><p>HAGLUND:  Oh.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just really quickly.  This will blow over, though, because the  American people care more about their healthcare, their livelihood, the  economy and the failure of the GOP and the Senate and the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Maybe enough noise to take the attention away from a huge  failure last night, that the Senate could not get the bill.  </p><p>And Obamacare lives.  And here we are.  Meanwhile, the Senate sending a  Russia sanctions bill to President Trump as well.  Cheryl Casone with that  story now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  So, the Senate they get something done  at least on this one, Maria.  They did approve a new package of sanctions  against Russia as well as Iran and North Korea.  </p><p>Now, the legislation bars the president from easing or waving the penalties  on Russia following the move.  Russia foreign ministry ordered the U.S.  embassy in Russia to reduce the number of its diplomat.</p><p>Meanwhile, the House has passed a $788 billion spending bill, that includes  nearly $1.6 billion for President Trump's controversial border wall with  Mexico.  </p><p>Most of the money is for the Pentagon which would fulfill a longtime GOP  promised to modernize the military.  However, the legislation expected to  run into Democratic opposition when it hands over to the Senate. </p><p>OK.  Well, the NFL may have finally figured out why television ratings were  down last season.  The number one reason according to a JD Power survey,  Colin Kaepernick's national anthem protest.</p><p>Twenty-six percent of fans but while fans the images (INAUDIBLE) a knee  during the anthem made them stop watching the game.  That could explain  why, he, right now does not have a job.</p><p>And may not get another one in professional football.  And let's stay on  football.  My favorite talk like another (INAUDIBLE) for the New York Jets.</p><p>According to Google, Tom Brady owns the team.  You know, the quarterback of  the Patriots.  And how this worked out, searches for owner of the Jets or  owner of the New York Jets on Google yesterday somehow listed New England  Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady as the owner.  </p><p>Of course, despite what happened here the actual owner is Woody Johnson.   And a spokesman from Google didn't have any comment about the mix up.   However, it happened.  All right.  Those are your headlines.</p><p>Coming up.  Automakers are revving up production for electric cars.  We are  going to take a look at the hot new chargeable pickup trucks hitting the  road.  You're watching \"Mornings with Maria.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A jolt to the auto industry.  The New York  startup Bollinger Motors is sparking some competition with big names like  Ford and Tesla.  </p><p>Thanks to a new battery-powered pickup.  Joining us now FoxNews.com's  Automotive Editor Gary Gastelu.  Talk to us about it, Gary.  You got a  sneak peek the new truck last night.  </p><p>GARY GASTELU, AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR, FOXNEWS.COM:  Yes.  So, this company  started in secret a couple years ago, Upstate New York on a farm basically.  </p><p>And they had been working on it.  They just announced they are going to be  coming out with this truck a couple months ago.  Showed it last night.  </p><p>It's an electric SUV that you can convert into a pickup.  It's got a very  old-school look as you can see.  All electric, 200-mile range.  Pretty  quick as fast as a lot of sports cars that are out there right now.</p><p>And it was designed to be very extreme off-road pickup like Jeep, but also  be a work truck.  It's got a lot of space for storage and carry woods and  stuff like that around.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It reminds me of a Hummer.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it looks like -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks like a Hummer.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It looks like the old -- it looks like the old Land Rover  even the headlight, Toyota Land Cruiser look to it as well.  The old -- </p><p>GASTELU:  Land Rover Defender.  The old FJ.  Also, it's about exactly the  same size as the original Ford Bronco which looks a lot like as well.  You  know, there's a -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Except the Ford Bronco was like narrow and had (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>GASTELU:  More narrow but the same length.  But kind of the same concept  and as I said you can pull the top off and turn it into a pickup truck.  </p><p>A lot of excitement about this.  It was a very convincing vehicle that they  showed last night.  It was a good build.  </p><p>There had a lot of people involved that are engineers for race trucks and  that sort of thing.  So, they did a pretty good job with this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much -- how much is it?</p><p>KELLY:  What about the battery -- oh, sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How much is it, though?  How much are they going to charge for?</p><p>GASTELU:  You know, they are targeting under a hundred thousand.  Hopefully  a lot less than that.  Low volume to start off, maybe 5,000 to 10,000 a  year.  But hopefully be able to grow that.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) built in United States.  They are going to do it with  themselves with help from contract manufacturers or maybe work with  somebody like AM General (INAUDIBLE) actually built for them.  </p><p>KELLY:  What about their battery in extreme weather condition?  I mean, the  extreme cold or the extreme heat.  How does that work out?</p><p>GASTELU:  It's a liquid climate controlled battery pack.  It can actually  go underwater it's sealed.  So, if you're off-road, it is sealed against  the elements as well.</p><p>They used a lot of off the shelf components proven technology that  reinvented the wheel.  </p><p>KELLY:  Got it.</p><p>GASTELU:  It's really more the design of the truck that they've come up  with themselves.  Look, nobody else is in this particular space.  Tesla is  going to handle like pickup a couple years, but probably more like an F- 150.  </p><p>But at the time, it sort of classic looking off-road truck, more of a  novelty.  Nobody is really in here the white space to go (INAUDIBLE) like  Tesla got into the electric sports cars business 10 years ago.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Without the actual, how far along are they inputting a  manufacturing plan thing into place?  Because this could be years and years  out if you -- if you're still just beginning to like set up manufacturing  facility bringing partners on?</p><p>GASTELU:  They are planning to start taking deposits next year and have it  in production within 18 months.  Again, they're going to work with a lot of  existing contract manufacturers.</p><p>They already do this sort of thing.  They can knock it out pretty quickly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do they need charging stations?  I mean, how does this -- I  mean, how does it stack up to gas in diesel powered trucks?</p><p>GASTELU:  Yes.  I mean, look, the charging (INAUDIBLE) required -- you  know, again, this is kind of (INAUDIBLE) you're going to use it -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you'll need -- that's the thing.  You don't have charging  stations, though?</p><p>GASTELU:  No.  But you can plug it at home, of course, with your home  charging station that you can buy.  And, you know, this is going to be  aimed at people who are going to be using it off-road under big properties  on their farms (INAUDIBLE) perhaps.  </p><p>And so, they are not going to have to drive that far anyway.</p><p>HAGLUND:  What kind of pressure does this put on the big three who are  already being pressured by companies like Tesla and now you got this  potential?  I mean, are they feeling any stiff competition here or  pressure?</p><p>GASTELU:  Look, Ford is coming out with a new Bronco in a couple of years.   It's going to be a very traditional vehicle.  It's not going to be electric  Bronco.</p><p>If this company comes along, it blows up the way Tesla does selling 10,000;  20,000; 30,000 trucks a couple of years from that venture.  I think they  are going to be moving more in that direction.  </p><p>But right now it's more a (INAUDIBLE) vehicle.  It's something they can get   in there without really disrupting things too much.  But again, look what  Tesla did in the past 10 years (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  Gary, thanks.</p><p>GASTELU:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gary Gastelu.  Check out FoxNews.com for more there.  Still  ahead (INAUDIBLE) with House Speaker Paul Ryan, that continues.  We  discussed the outlook for tax reform, healthcare and a lot more.

We're seeing selling but it's not intense, what do you  make of that Riva?</p><p>GOLD:  Yes.  People have never really bought Amazon for its profits and its  revenues.  It's really being a bet on kind of future growth and where  retail is going going forward.  </p><p>So the shares were down around three percent earlier this morning.

We thought they deserve better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Despite the healthcare setback, republican leaders are looking  ahead to tax reform.

I mean that's -- I  mean what happened this week has been unbelievable especially on healthcare  and also what's happening in this administration.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about healthcare, this shows that to be republicans  have failed.  They cannot govern, they have seven years, they might be able  to win elections, they can't reform a ballooning entitlement, and this  country is headed for a debt crisis, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there are a bunch of democrats too.  Let's call them what  they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about this.  We have a lot to talk about this.   Overnight, the senate republican's healthcare bill failed.  Three GOP  lawmakers voted against the skinny repeal including Arizona Senator John  McCain.</p><p>Leaders from both party speaking after the early morning vote, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCCONNELL:  Imagine many of our colleagues on the other side are  celebrating, probably pretty happy about all this but the American people  are hurting.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  I would say to my dear  friend the Majority Leader, we are not celebrating.  We are relieved that  millions and millions of people who would have been so drastically hurt by  the three proposals put forward will at least retain their healthcare.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump tweeted his disappointment as well.  He said  this:</p><p>TEXT:  Three republicans and forty eight democrats let the American people  down.  As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode then deal.   Watch!</p><p>Republicans are now turning their attention to tax reform as developments  unfolded over healthcare last night.  Republican leaders laid out a broad  proposal on taxes.  The key sticking point, the border adjustment tax was  taken off the table.</p><p>I spoke with the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan who was pushing for the  border tax for a while.  And I first asked him about that decision, why it  was a necessary step to get it out of the way to move forward?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>RYAN:  What we're trying to communicate is that we think most of all that  is important is that we come to common ground on how to do tax reform so  that we can get tax reform done in 2017.</p><p>What I and other house leaders who have been pushing the border adjustment,  I still think it's the way to go, I think that's the right kind of tax  reform plan but if it's going to stop us getting to consensus to get tax  reform done then we don't want that to happen, meaning the border  adjustment.</p><p>We want the consensus to get tax reform done, it is more important for us  than anything that we get tax reform done because we think it is absolutely  critical for a strong economic growth.  And so what we wanted to do is go  through and look at the details to see if there's a viable alternative to a  border adjustment tax.</p><p>If there's a way of doing tax reform that still gets what we're trying to  get which are low tax rates, expensing, things like in territorial system.   The aspects of tax reform that we agree on, we wanted to make sure that we  could still achieve those things without having a cash flow tax or a border  adjustment tax.</p><p>Once we realize that that is viable, then we agreed we need to go on a  common template and now we're getting our tax writers.  That the Ways and  Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, we have tasked them with  taking on the task of writing the details of the tax bill within this  template which we now agreed too.</p><p>So getting consensus between the White House, the senate, and the house on  a way forward on tax reform makes it that much more of a viable enterprise.   I feel much more confident that we're going to stick the landing on tax  reform because we have now said, \"We have consensus, here's the framework,  let's go get it done.\"  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good news.  Does tax reform have to be revenue neutral?</p><p>RYAN:  Well it has to be compliant with what we call the (INAUDIBLE), it  has to be compliant with our reconciliation packages, our reconciliation  rules. </p><p>So what people may not know is that in the House we use macroeconomic  scoring, we call that dynamic scoring to some people.  So we take into  account the economic effects, economic growth effects of tax changes and we  use a realistic baseline that reflects current policy, our current policy  proposals.</p><p>What that means is we can have a big tax cut but also make sure that we are  in compliance with our deficit targets, our deficit rules.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you need to find revenue somewhere else?  I mean that  border adjustment tax -- </p><p>RYAN:  Of course.  Of course.  So the answer is yes to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- is going to raise $1 trillion over 10 years.</p><p>RYAN:  But the point -- that's right.  But the point I'm making is, with  all the tools we have to make sure that when we revenue estimate our tax  reform bills, we take into consideration economic growth effects.  That  helps a great deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're expecting three percent growth at some point to take  hold.</p><p>RYAN:  I don't think we can get to three percent growth without tax reform.   I really believe that the secrets to getting the three percent growth which  clearly is a goal we're going to achieve in this country: regulatory  relief, working on labor supply, welfare to work but tax reform.  </p><p>You can't get to three percent growth in my opinion without tax reform.   That is why this is so important, that's why we all agree.  And the thing  about tax reform is we as republicans especially now agree on how to do it,  healthcare is a good example.</p><p>There is not a complete consensus on how to best to do healthcare reform.   On tax reform we have that consensus.  Healthcare, we can't put everything  we want in a reconciliation bill to complete our vision on healthcare  reform.  It's one of the reasons why it's become difficult.  </p><p>Tax reform, we can put the entire tax reform package in this reconciliation  bill.  One bill, full comprehensive tax reform which brings tax relief to  families, tax rate reduction for businesses, makes us globally competitive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are the opportunities then to raise revenue if you are  going to be compliant in terms of reconciliation and revenue neutral?</p><p>RYAN:  It's the classical, you got to broaden the base to lower the tax  rates.  We believe we need to clear out loopholes and deductions, carve  outs, special interest giveaways so that we can lower tax rates for  everybody across the board, for businesses, for families.</p><p>We also believe on the family side, and this is something we've been pretty  explicit about, raise that standard deduction, get away some of the carve  outs but preserve things like charity and mortgages and retirement savings.</p><p>But clean up that tax code so you dramatically simplify, it helps you  consolidate tax brackets, it helps people to have a simplified system.  And  on the business side, as I mentioned, you've got to take away loopholes so  that you can lower tax rates and that is the work that our tax rate  committees will now engage in doing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are those the sacred cows then, the deductions that must be in  there, charity, mortgage?</p><p>RYAN:  That's for individuals.  So we believe -- we long said that we need  to make sure that we need to make sure that we prioritize those things:  retirement, savings, charity, and mortgages. </p><p>But we also think by raising the standard exemption for families, we can  dramatically simplify the code, most people don't even have to itemize  their deductions, they can have a postcard-type tax form.  So we think  dramatic simplification but also maintaining important priorities like own  homeownership, charitable giving.</p><p>But then on the business side, we know we're the last country in the  industrialized world that had this crazy worldwide tax system that  basically says you can't bring your money back home.  You'll get taxed if  you do.  </p><p>We've got to get rid of that system, we have to have a territorial systems  so that companies with cash parked overseas can bring that money back home,  it's $2 trillion to $3 trillion.  We think that's very, very important, we  all agree on that and we think there's a way forward on how to do that  short of a border adjustment tax.</p><p>And on rates themselves, we got to get our tax rates done and businesses so  that we're in the hunts with respect to global competitiveness.  Our  corporate rate is 35 percent, the top pass through tax rates is 44.6  percent, and the average tax rate on businesses and the industrialized  world is 22.5 percent.  That is making us absolutely uncompetitive.  We  know we have to get those rates down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But let me ask you about something that sort of wowed and  really struck a lot of the people who voted for your party and for Donald  Trump and that is, I want to ask you if you support White House Strategist  Steve Bannon's proposal that he is willing to raise the highest rate up to  44 percent?  Is this something you support?</p><p>RYAN:  I think the Trump plan that he put out, the president put out  earlier in the year fits our preferences.  I think his rates were 10, 25,  and 35.  That's the kind of thing that we were looking at, that's the kind  of area where we have consensus.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you --</p><p>RYAN:  So the president's plan that he put out with Secretary MNuchin and  NEC Director Cohn I think are the areas we're looking at going.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are you saying that you would probably not support 44  percent on that --</p><p>RYAN:  I'm not going to going to comment on something I don't even know  about or I haven't seen.  But I have seen the president's framework on tax  reform which is what we're working off of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It just seems like as a republican talking about lowering  taxes, 44 percent for the higher earners is (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>RYAN:  Yes, that's what it is right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well it's 39.6 for the highest --</p><p>RYAN:  Yes, you take 20 pats (INAUDIBLE) and then some other things you do  with the ObamaCare taxes and the top affected tax rate for like a pass  through, 44.6 percent.</p><p>Getting our rates down is what we're -- we're in the business of lowering  tax rates, we're not in the business of higher -- raising tax rates.  The  point is, the president himself with his economic advisers put out a  framework that we think really works.</p><p>And then now on the business side, we spent the last three months looking  at making sure that there's a viable alternative to a cash flow border  adjustment tax that still allows us to become a territorial system, get our  tax rates down.</p><p>Now that we are confident that we can have that system, that that is  achievable, we're moving forward with the same template in agreement so  that our tax writers can go get this done and we can pass this this fall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because some people would say if you're not for cutting taxes  on the highest earners, you're not for cutting taxes because the highest  earners pay most of the tax.</p><p>RYAN:  Well here's the -- I would put it a different way, most of these  people are businesses.  What a lot of -- the world doesn't do it this way  but America does.  We tax our businesses as individuals.</p><p>Eighty percent of American businesses are what we call pass throughs: LLC,  sole proprietor, subchapter S corporations.  Ninety percent of the  businesses in Wisconsin are pass throughs, they pay their taxes as  individuals.  </p><p>And they're paying 44.6 percent as the top rate, we compete against Canada  every day in Wisconsin, their tax rate is 15 percent, Ireland is 12.5  percent, England's going to 17 percent, China is 25 and going down.</p><p>And as I said, the average in the industrial role is 22.5, so we've got to  get these tax rates done and we all have a consensus.  Not only do we have  a consensus on doing that, we now have a consensus on how we do that and  that's what's important here, that's the takeaway with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are you going to make sure that you don't encourage fraud  in doing this?  I mean how do I know that an individual who's paying 44.6  percent is not going to say, \"Oh, you know what, I'm an LLC I'm going to  start my own business so I want to get 155 percent.\"</p><p>RYAN:  Yes, it's a good question.  It's a completely legitimate question  and, again, that is exactly what our tax writers are working on.  This is a  conversation that's been going on between the Ways and Means Committee, the  Finance Committee and the Treasury Department and that's clearly something  that they're going to be coming up with.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of my exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan,  next hour, stay with us on that.  We're going to take a short break, we got  a lot to cover --</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news overnight, at least 50 people  injured after a train crashes in Barcelona.  Cheryl Casone with the  details, good morning Cherly.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  Yes, a  dramatic crash to tell you about.  This commuter train crashed into the  platform in Northeastern Barcelona.</p><p>This incident happened around 7:15a.m. local time, that is commuter time  for them, 48 people reportedly treated at that scene, five in serious  condition, the driver of the train reportedly among those that were  injured.  The cause of the crash is being investigated.</p><p>Well the State Department is ordering the relatives of American diplomats  in Venezuela to leave that country ahead of next week's controversial vote.   The State Department says it's going to allow U.S. workers to leave the  Embassy in Caracas and limit movement of those who decides to stay.</p><p>Americans also urge not to travel to Venezuela due to violence there.  the  United States is urging President Maduro to cancel that vote and the U.S.  is also threatening for their sanctions if that vote occurs.  More than 100  people have reportedly died over the last four months of antigovernment  protests in that region.</p><p>Well meanwhile here at home, let's talk about Delta Airlines, the latest  airline to reduce service down to Venezuela.  They're planning to leave  Caracas of September 17th.  They drastically cut service to Venezuela three  years ago after a currency dispute with the government.  But Delta  certainly making moves as well there.</p><p>All right.  Wells Fargo going to refund nearly $80 million to car loan  customers after reportedly forcing them to buy auto insurance.  The  incident affecting nearly 570,000 customers and this comes after the  company reached the $190 million settlement with regulators over complaints  that banking staff there had opened more than $2 million unauthorized  client accounts last September.</p><p>And it looks like Apple's changing its tune literally.  The company is  killing off both the iPod Nano and the iPod Shuffle, so glad I own one of  those two things.  All right.  Here's the statement from Apple: </p><p>TEXT: We are simplifying our iPod lineup with two models of iPod Touch now  with double the capacity starting at just $199.  We are discontinuing the  iPod Shuffle and the Nano.</p><p>Now the iPod Touch is the only dedicated handheld music device that's now  listed for sale on the website.  So if anybody wants an opened, in the box  Nano, Maria, it is yours, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Great.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  All right.  What  do you make of this, Apple discontinuing these products?</p><p>KELLY:  I mean it makes sense, nobody's using them and nobody's buying them  anymore, right?  So I mean it makes sense because it cost them more to  maintain and basically build them.</p><p>HAGLUND:  Right.  And -- right.  And one of the keys to Apple's products is  that they are able to update the product and make you buy a new one every  single year and with these iPods, that's just not possible.  So as a  business model it makes sense.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, they really rely on batteries dying quicker so you have to buy  new phones, right?  These things last forever.  I've been --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the battery's really good on Dagen's phone.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The new -- the latest iteration.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, they're starting to get -- but it just shows you how it's a  close architecture because when I had a Blackberry, I would take out the  battery, I could get a new one, put in, they will last longer.  But they've  got a great business model and we're -- they don't allow you to do that.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  Still build things to last, right?  Why do that when you can buy  a new one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HAGLUND:  Promo's $1,000 every year, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It would be great.  Lovely.  When we come back, the search for  Uber's new CEO continues this morning.  The new high profile candidate  reportedly on the short list, that's next.</p><p>Then Hillary Clinton's new book cover going viral, the internet's hilarious  response to her title, what happened?  Still ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another high profile candidate topping the short  list for Uber's vacant CEO position, Tracee Carrasco now with the story,  Tracee --</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  Yes, another name  added to that list, that's about six people according to \"The Wall Street  Journal.\"</p><p>General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, he'll be stepping down from  his job there at the end of August after a somewhat rocky 16-year tenure.   Another name that had been circulating earlier this week, Hewlett Packard  Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman.</p><p>Whitman putting those rumors to bed in a series of tweets last night.  She  said:</p><p>TEXT: Normally I do not comment on rumors, but the speculation about my  future and Uber has become a distraction.  So let me make this as clear as  I can, I am fully committed to HPE and plan to remain the company's CEO.   We have a lot of work still to do at HPE and I am not going anywhere.  Uber  CEO will not be Meg Whitman.</p><p>There you have it.  Uber hopes to pick a new CEO by September.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So now they're talking to Jeff Immelt, what kind of a leader  does Uber need after the press that has gone, Tracee?</p><p>CARRASCO:  They need someone that's going to come in there and clean up the  corporate image, redirect the company.  Frankly, they need a grownup after  Travis Kalanick, all the scandals that we've seen.</p><p>KELLY:  Well they need someone that's going to bring in a good team as  well.  So -- and really set the tone because it's the culture that's been  the problem and it has been for years.  So it's pervasive throughout their  system.</p><p>And if they ever want to go public, they're going to need to find a strong  CFO as well.  So they're in deep trouble here.  So that's why they're  trying to find effective leader but these people don't want the job,  they're happy where they're at.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But rather than looking in the rearview mirror in trying to fix  the problems that the company and the cultural problems which anybody in  Silicon Valley could have told you about from day one, they need somebody  who has vision who can bring in as you said a development team, technology  team, and who can see where this company needs to be two years from now and  five years from now.</p><p>HAGLUND:  Yes.  Especially because the competition is so fierce now, you've  got Lyft, you've got Via, you've got all these other ride sharing services,  so it's not like they're the only player in the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For a little while they were.  </p><p>HAGLUND:  Yes.  Right, exactly.</p><p>KELLY:  Well they're looking market share and the biggest problems, their  latest valuation is around let's say $65 billion, they're nowhere near that  now.  They're bleeding cash, they need to raise more capital.</p><p>So the first thing they have to do is put in a really good CEO so they can  go out and raise more money.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And when they do put a CFO in there, that will tell you  that they're actually putting plans together (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY:  That's for IPO.  That's what they're signaling the market, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For an IPO.  Tracee, thank you.  Tracee Carrasco.

He railed  against the leaks coming out of the White House, saying this, \"I'm not  Steve Bannon.  I'm not trying to expletive my own expletive.  I'm not  trying to build my own brand off of the expletive strength of the  President.  I'm here to serve the country.\"</p><p>He then slammed White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus saying this,  \"They'll all be fired by me.  I fired one guy the other day.

It will not happen again.\"  OK.  Tension in the  White House.  What do we think, Dagen?  What do you say?  What do you say?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I think that the President is  great at creating major waves, if not tsunamis for himself and the  administration.  And you have to be very careful about creating even a  bigger storm for the White House.  And right now, for the most part, and  I've said this, the economy is doing well.  We're going to get GDP as you  pointed out, later this morning.  The economy is holding up, confidence is  still up, the stock market at all-time highs.  That's giving the White  House and the administration a pass.  If that starts to give way, you  better watch out.  And Americans are not going to be tolerant of this kind  of behavior.  I mean, with all due respect to Anthony Scaramucci.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Look, Anthony is a friend of this program.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, he is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's been on this program (INAUDIBLE) times.  He's a friend,  personally.  We were all sort of taken aback when we read this article and  those comments.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, RECON CAPITAL:  Yes.  And it's a  shame because this distracts from the agenda trying to get done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>KELLY:  As we're seeing health care implode right now, we need to see  leadership, especially trying to get the Democrats come around, but if  you're a Democrat, why would you work with this administration?  The  administration is in chaos.  But given the Democrats --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  I know.  I know.  I know, but --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I believe in what Anthony talked about.  I believe in front  stabbing.  That Southerners and New Yorkers are the same in terms of we'll  look you in the eye and tell you exactly where -- what we think about you,  where you stand with us, we also carry grudges, we carry a grudge for a  long time, and we will lie in wait and strike at the -- at absolutely the  perfect moment but in terms of using that kind of language when you're  talking to somebody who you don't even know.  It's one thing if you were  overheard having a very salty discussion with a close friend of yours but  this is a phone call that he placed.</p><p>KELLY:  This should have been behind closed doors and not played to the  press and to a reporter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  Meanwhile, big week for earnings, absolutely, we  had the Fed this week, we've got the busiest week in terms of earnings so  far in the second-quarter.  Among the top names reporting this morning,  Chevron and ExxonMobil.  It is technology, though, has been the real story,  obviously.  That's the group that's been leading this market.  The big name  last night was Amazon.  The stock was down last night and it is down this  morning in the premarket after the company's second-quarter earnings came  in below expectations.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about it, Wells Fargo Investment  Institute, Head Global Market Strategist, Paul Christopher.  Paul, good to  see you, thanks so much joining us.</p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize the backdrop for us in terms of earnings and how - - and its impact on stocks.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, yes, you were talking about it, just a minute ago, the  economy is still moving along steadily, it really doesn't have much  acceleration power, but the momentum is still there 2 to 2-1/2 percent a  year.  That's going to generate some earnings.  We think 6.4 percent year- on-year, for this quarter, we think earnings get even a little bit better.   In the coming couple of quarters, despite today's miss by Amazon, we think  tech will lead the way this quarter.  We think up 11 percent year-on-year.</p><p>KELLY:  Paul, do you -- do you take offense to what's happened to the  dollar?  I mean, we've seen it go down six percent in the first quarter of  the year.  It really helped technology stocks, because about half of their  earnings come from overseas, but then we saw Amazon last night, said they  actually had a head wind, it actually negatively impact them.  Do you --  how do you see the dollar playing out into the second half and into next  year on earnings?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, it's an interesting question.  One we get quite a bit  from our clients these days, too.  Most of that moving the dollar, about  $0.06, has come since the end of June, and that's been really fueled by  speculation that monetary policies around the world are going to finally  come together and all move in a normalization direction, taking interest  rates out of negative territory for the Europeans and stopping central  banks from continuing to buy bonds the way they've been doing.  We think  that's a trend but it's probably been overstated.  In other words, the  magnitude and the timing have probably been moved forward way too much.   The dollar is oversold right now.  The Euro definitely overbought.  We  think certainly if you get to 120 on the Euro, you'll start to see  policymakers in Europe start to make that point as well.</p><p>KELLY:  Do you see any impacts of what happened last night in Congress  affecting the market today and what's going to happen with healthcare?   Because we know that Obamacare is unsustainable and the big winners have  been the insurance policies, but are we going to see knock-on effects into  the market?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  They'll probably play out over time.  There's a couple of  pieces of -- or couple questions, really, that still need to be answered  and that is, what will the Republicans do with health care if they move tax  reform to the prime place on the agenda right now, that sort of language,  because the insurance companies are getting ready to make decisions about  their future participation in the Affordable Care Act.  And the second  piece is what will the Democrats do going forward?  Will they start to  demand some momentum around the idea of price controls on prescription  drugs and that would affect pharma, of course?  So, those are two big open  questions that will remain if Mr. Ryan and the Congress and the House  decide to move ahead to tax reform.  We just don't know what the answers to  those questions will be yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, in terms of the lack of action on health care reform, is  it more of a broader economic story than it is an individual stock story,  in the sense of you still have small employers with there being basically  strangled by this mandate to provide health insurance to their employees,  you still have a lot of these taxes in place for the time being, like the  medical devices tax.  So, is that an albatross around the neck of the  economy as it really has been in the last eight years?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Oh, I would say that, yes, there's a certain amount of  strangulation, a certain amount of weight that falls on the economy as a  result of regulation, and especially the uncertainty about what regulation  might be in the future, what requirements from the federal government might  be in the future.  This is one that you mentioned.  There are quite a few  others.  And along with tax reform, really, investors are looking for the  next year to bring more clarity around the President's effort to deregulate  the economy and free up businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, Apple reports next week, Paul.  Tech is obviously not  done.  Would you buy Apple ahead of the numbers next week?  What are you  expecting?  And would you put new money to work right here in the broad  market given this big run-up we've seen since Election Day?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, we're not -- we're not really convinced that the tech is  overbought here but we'd like the market weight position right now on Apple  and the other -- and the other companies in the tech sector.  Where we  would really be emphasizing right now are our activity for investors is to  take some -- take some profits here.  If you've got profits in some of  these sectors that we think will underperform in the future, those sectors  being consumer staples and utilities, and energy, we think that that's a  great place to take some gains and then recycle that money back into  sectors we like going forward, which would include the consumer  discretionary, the industrials of the cyclicals, plus financials.  And we  do like healthcare going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much of the anticipation of tax reform do you think is  priced into this market already?  In other words, it's going to be a big  disappointment.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Oh, not very much at all.  In fact --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  I'm sorry.  Yes, we track what we would consider a Trump  portfolio overweighting the sectors that we think hypothetically that would  do well in a -- in a tax reform environment and in infrastructure and  deregulation environment.  Sectors like industrials and financials,  materials, for example.  And that portfolio has underperformed the S&amp;P  distinctly since the President released his one-page tax outline at the end  of April.  We think investors have been gradually taking a much more  pessimistic view on tax reform.  And so, if you got some real momentum here  building behind tax reform, it would be a boost to the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Paul, great to see you,  thanks so much.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Christopher joining us at Wells Fargo.  Coming up,  tourists are forced to evacuate a popular vacation destination in North  Carolina, why emergency officials urged more than 10,000 people to leave.   That's next.  Plus, prosecutors in Martin Shkreli's case make their final  push.  What happened during the closing arguments?  Next.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets are looking lower this morning.  Take a  look at Futures indicating a decline of about 40 points on the Dow  Industrials this morning.  Down 50 on the NASDAQ, that's almost one  percent.</p><p>A couple of names on the move this morning, American Airlines is set to  report earnings ahead of the open this morning.  Analysts are expecting the  company to report a profit of $1.87 a share, revenue of just over $11  billion.  It has been a difficult reporting season so far for the airline  industry.  Some analysts are raising concerns about the current quarter.   We are also watching Starbucks, the coffee giant, reporting third-quarter  results after the close last night, mostly in line with estimates.  The  stock is still down six percent.  The company announced it will close all  of its Teavana stores over the coming years.  Stock is getting hit today.</p><p>An Indiana Police Officer killed investigating a car crash.  Cheryl Casone  with the story -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, that's right, Maria.  So,  the police officer has now been identified as Lieutenant Aaron Allan.  He  was the 2015 Officer of the Year for the Southport Police Department.  Our  reports say he walked up to a car that slipped in a crash.  One of the  occupants of that car then shot him.  Police did not have a motive for the  shooting.</p><p>Well, trouble at a top tourist destination.  I'll tell you about it.  A  state of emergency has been declared on Ocracoke Island on North Carolina's  outer banks.  10,000 visitors ordered to evacuate because of a power outage  there.  A problem again yesterday after a construction company working on a  new bridge accidentally hit an electric cable.  Now, officials want to get  tourists off the island by noon today.  That's fun for your summer  vacation.  No one is going to be allowed on the island unless they can  prove that they actually live on that island.</p><p>Well, back here in the New York area, prosecutors of Martin Shkreli who  secured his fraud trial says it was all a brazen con, but during closing  arguments, defense attorneys argued that no one should feel sorry for the  alleged victims because they were high rollers who ended up doubling or  tripling their money.  We should say jury deliberations in that trial could  actually begin today out in Brooklyn. </p><p>Well, the internet is having a little bit of fun with Hillary Clinton's new  book and especially it's the title.  So, the book, \"What Happened\" is going  to be hitting stands in September.  In the book, she's promising to give us  some dirt on Russian meddling and insights into her failed campaign, but  the internet is giving us some different titles for the book, mocking the  former Presidential candidate, one of them is \"Hillary Rodham Clinton, How  I Deleted My Emails.\"  That's the only one I can show you, the rest, Maria,  are R-rated.  But I could show you that one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I could -- all you need is a question mark and you have to say  it out loud, what happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good impersonation.  The best!</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sorry, that's all I've got.  It's 6:47 in the morning.</p><p>KELLY:  I wonder if she's still carrying hot sauce with her, though.   Remember, she takes that everywhere she goes.  I wonder if she's still  carrying that with her.</p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Oh, god.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, that look on your face --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is the hot sauce?  That might be one title that they were  giving that.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where is the hot sauce.</p><p>KELLY:  Whenever she goes down to the south, she has a hot sauce with her.</p><p>HAGLUND:  There's a hashtag on Twitter.  It's hilarious, if you want to see  more of those book titles.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  #booktitiles?</p><p>HAGLUND:  #hillarybooktitles</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How about, quote, \"There's a Special Place in Hell for .\" </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  All right.  Coming up,  the movie, Atomic Blonde punches its way into theaters.  We're taking a  look at whether the action flick can win the box office battle this  weekend.  All next.  Right after this break, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Trust no one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  David (INAUDIBLE) Welcome to Berlin.  I'm David --  don't shoot.  I've got your shoe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from the new movie Atomic Blonde which drops in  theaters this weekend.  It is an adaptation of the graphic novel, The  Coldest City.  Said in 1989, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, Atomic  Blonde follows a British spy as she fights to take down an espionage ring.</p><p>Joining us right now in the Foxlight Host, Senior Vice President of  Marketing at Fox News, Michael Tammero.  Michael, great to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF MARKETING:   Good  morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This looks good, actually.  It had a budget of $30 million.  It  is on track to rake in $20 to $22 million at the box office.  What do you  think of that?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Sort of a modest budget, you know, when you think of it these  days.  Good word of mouth, Charlize Theron, what a career.  She's paving  the way with carving such a great niche for herself, as playing strong  women right after Mad Max, she was so good in that.  It's based on a comic  book, good word-of-mouth, following -- probably come in around three,  behind Dunkirk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because Dunkirk is still doing really well.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Dunkirk over performed last week pulled in $55 plus million,  probably do really good business this weekend.  And it's the kind of movie  that has legs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, if you are not in mood for an action flick, there is the  Emoji Movie also opening this weekend.  This is the 3-D animated comedy  voiced by James Corden, T.J. Miller, and Christina Aguilera.  Let's take a  look.  Let's take a look.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Let's not -- let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Sweetie, you're so handsome when you make that face.   I think he's ready now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's our user, Allan.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have an incoming text.  We are go for (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Who?  Me?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  What's he doing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's making the wrong face.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Huh?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What the heck?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TAMMERO:  What the heck?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What the heck?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Because the best part, Patrick Stewart as Poop.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So, is this a family film?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Family film.  The reviews have not been kind to the Emoji Movie,  but that said, it appeals to a large group of people.  I think kids are  going to go see this.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you said it's debuting at 20 million?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes, probably come in at number one this weekend above Dunkirk,  but the thing here, a much-needed shot in the arm personae this summer,  following Spiderman, Emoji Movie, they have the Dark Tower based on the  Stephen King book coming out later this summer.  You know, last fiscal  year, they had a $700 million loss, so this is -- this is a very critical  summer for them.  And they're -- so far, they're doing a lot better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, animation in general, the animation area in terms of  moviemaking, is that getting bigger?</p><p>TAMMERO:  It used to be a surefire hit, not so much now, but, you know, it  depends on the movie.  Disney Pixar was always, you know, a win at the box  office, this will probably do well.  It's sort of -- you know, Sony has  been trying to mine new material.  Last year, they brought on Angry Birds,  based on an app.  This is based on an app.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, who doesn't like emojis?  Take a look at my emoji,  because I love it.  My friend --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TAMMERO:  You had your own emoji.  Look at that!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  My friend (INAUDIBLE) and I love it.  Who doesn't like emojis?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Looking fabulous, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you don't see -- oh, you see my shoes with the -- with the  toes out.  That's my favorite part.  That's my favorite part.  The biggest  promotional sporting event of the summer hitting theaters, Connor McGregor  stepping out on the -- into the boxing ring to face the undefeated Floyd  Mayweather next month in the Money Fight.  Let's talk about this.  I mean,  the tickets are sky high.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Sky high.  Sometimes charging $99.95.  $99.95.  Look at it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, instead of paying $100 to watch this on pay-per-view,  fans can also pay $40 in advance for watching on the big screen.</p><p>TAMMERO:  It's a great idea.  And this is sort of where the business is  going.  We were approached earlier this -- during the campaign, AMC wanted  to host the debates and charge people for the debates, and they want Fox  News to carry it.  We wound up not doing that but theaters are now looking  for new revenue streams.  You know, with so much competition between  Netflix and cable and all the options that consumers have, they're looking  to provide and expand their -- what they offer and this is a great way to  do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.  I remember around the debates.  You're right that the  theaters wanted to just get people in the theater.</p><p>TAMMERO:  They'll do anything these days because the movies have sort of  flatlined.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's true.  Michael, great to see you.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Good to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great weekend, Michael Tammero.  Still ahead, my  exclusive interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan about the progress on tax  reform, healthcare, and a lot more.  That's next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA,  right here.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Friday, everybody, thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, July 28th.  Your top  stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Breaking news overnight,  the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare has collapsed.  Three Republican  Senators voted against the legislation late last night.  Leaving Capitol  Hill last night, Senator Ted Cruz remained hopeful about the future of  overhauling health care even now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS:  The five years I've served in the Senate,  there's no issue I have fought harder on, devoted more time to than  stopping the disaster that is Obamacare.  And mark my words, I am committed  to this fight.  As long as there is breath in my body, I will be fighting  for the working men and women of this country that are being hurt by  Obamacare.  And I believe it will be repealed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Republican leadership has a plan to move forward on tax reform,  meanwhile, without worrying about Obamacare taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.

That is why the house who offered the border- adjustment tax realized that that was preventing us from getting consensus to get to tax reform and once we realized there is a perfectly viable way to tax reform without having to do that, we agreed to go that direction in the sake of consensus so we can get this done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: More on why he says tax reform is critical to get to three percent growth to the economy. Meanwhile, drama in the west wing and I am not talking about the television show. Communications director Anthony Scaramucci making waves after scathing comments he made to a New Yorker magazine reporter, the fallouts coming up this morning. We're watching earnings from the oil joints today, ExxonMobiland Chevron reporting ahead of the opening bell this morning. The company is under pressure amid the recent decline in oil prices, ExxonMobildown 11 percent, chevron down nine percent. This is year-to-date.</p><p>Markets this morning under pressure today as well after a record-setting week. The Dow industrials set to open down about 20 points. NASDAQ down 30 points, down two-thirds of a percent. ExxonMobiljust reporting right now, revenue is above estimates, set $62.8 billion versus 61 billion, estimate in terms of the earnings -- that was a miss, in terms of earnings per share, so ExxonMobilhad been under some selling pressure, we'll see if that continues now with this breaking news.</p><p>We are waiting on GDP, we are getting our first look at the second quarter GDP, it's due out in 30 minutes, expectations call for growth of 2.6 percent for the second quarter and this of course is the first look at GDP. There will be revisions. In Europe, take a look at the indices this morning, the FT-100 is down two-thirds of a percent, the CAC Quarante is down better than one percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down almost half of a percent. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower as you see there.</p><p>Chaos in Venezuela reaching a fever pitch, the U.S. is ordering families of diplomats to leave immediately. Delta Airlines is also suspending flights to the country. The search for Uber's next CEO is narrowing. Meg Whitman took herself out of the running but it is a new edition that's taking many by surprise. We will tell you who that is, who Uber is looking for to fill that role.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, market strategist, Kevin Kelly, and political analyst, Kirsten Haglund. So happy you're here today. Good morning.</p><p>KIRTSEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ANALYST: Oh, thank you. Crazy morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Happy Friday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I know. Trying to can't keep up.</p><p>HAGLUND: TGIF, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Everything that's going on in just the last week. I can't keep up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Drama in the White House, a failure last night in the senate. I don't know, so now Obamacare is the law of the land. What happens now, Dagen? It's just --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I suspect that if as <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>seemed to indicate last night that if they even begin, the republicans working with democrats to shore up Obamacare, it's simply going to mean a lot more money, tens of billions of dollars, if not running into hundreds of billions of dollars to shore up these exchanges. Maybe you get rid of the medical devices tax but expect the M.D.'s investment taxes to stay in there which a lot of these republicans got behind. I don't - I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is what's been holding the economy back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're not going to a single player option which is what some democrats like the senator from Hawaii, Mazie Hironi - Hirono wants but you will - it would just be no entitlement reform, no reform of Medicaid and a lot more money.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MARKET STRATEGIST: It will just be big --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is what's been holding back the economy.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. It will be a big government central plan that will have no freedom of choice, there's no liberty in it, it's not going to contain cost. What it's going to do is it's going to hamper the system even more. It's going to continue to impact labor, that's why the labor participation rate, it's going to continue to impact small business, it's going to stifle this economy. It is a new around (INAUDIBLE) that's why it's just terrible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All of this, because of this top story. The senate republicans health care bill failed last night. Three GOP lawmakers voted against the so-called skinny repeal bill including Arizona Senator John McCain, as well Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins. Leaders from both parties spoke out after the vote. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>MITCH MCCONNELL </nameText></person>(R), KENTUCKY: Imagine many of our colleagues on the other side are celebrating. Probably pretty happy about all this. But the American people are hurting.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: I would say to my dear friend the majority leader, we are not celebrating, we are relieved that millions and millions of people who would have been so drastically hurt by the three proposals put forward will at least retain their health care.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump tweeted his disappointment as well, here's what he said. Three republicans and 48 democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode than deal. Watch. We are watching. Why couldn't republicans get their repeal passed, everybody has their own ideas and what this should look like. What really make me scratch my head and wonder if most of them all voted for a repeal and they've been talking about a repeal for seven years. And when they actually had the chance to do something, and fix things, they say no.</p><p>HAGLUND: You know what's really interesting was, it -- there was so much that happened yesterday, right? As we're watching this vote-a-rama happen, and then, you know, around, you know, in the 5:00 hour, those four or five senators came, Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator John McCain being a couple of them coming out and saying, this is why we can't do this. We're afraid that the bill is going to the house and they're just going to pass it as is, there will be no conference. Then House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>came out and said, no, we will have conference, we won't pass this bill. I mean, I thought after that that gives them the green light to go ahead and say, OK, we're going to continue to move this ball down the court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And still didn't do it.</p><p>HAGLUND: And they still didn't do it, it's incredibly sad. You know, when you look at how far we've come over the last eight years to see that they're there still is not a plan here, that there's still was not something that the GOP could coalesce around and they are going to pay for that because they are so divided right now, they're going to have to try to rebuild somehow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: To paraphrase The Wall Street Journal, one of the many editorials that they've written in recent weeks, the bumper sticker for republicans running for re-election, it's going to be -</p><p>HAGLUND: It was just too hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was just -</p><p>KELLY: They're keeping taxes-</p><p>HAGLUND: I can't do it.</p><p>KELLY: They're keeping taxes on investment.</p><p>HAGLUND: We can't govern.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They can get elected but they can't govern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the thing is - I mean, they said repeatedly they needed to do health care reform first in order to get to tax reform. In retrospect, mistake.</p><p>KELLY: No, they didn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mistake.</p><p>KELLY: No they didn't. Of course, not. They could had a bipartisan issue which is -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Should have done tax reform first.</p><p>KELLY: Tax cuts. Work with the democrats. The democrats want tax cuts and kick-start the economy and then that could have led into a health care and that would have been easy win for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here we are with the Obamacare taxes very much in place and now they are turning their attention to tax reform. I spoke with the speaker of the house last night, <person><nameText>Paul Ryan, </nameText></person>who says lawmakers can learn from the health care fight moving forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RYAN: We think most of all that is important is that we come to common ground on how to do tax reform so that we can get tax reform done in 2017. What I and other house leaders who have been pushing the boarder adjustment -- I still think it's the way to go, I think that's the right kind of tax reform plan but if it's going to stop us getting to consensus to get tax reform done, then we don't want that to happen. Meaning, the border- adjustment, we want the consensus to get tax reform done, it is more important for us than anything that we get tax reform done because we think it's absolutely critical for a strong economic growth.</p><p>And so what we want to do is go through and look at the details to see if there is a viable alternative to a border-adjustment tax. If there is a way of doing tax reform that still gets what we're trying to get which are low tax rates expensing things like a territorial system, the aspects of tax reform that we agree on, we wanted to make sure that we could still achieve those things without having a cash flow tax or a border-adjustment tax. Once we realize that that is viable, then we agreed we need to go own a common template and now we're getting our tax writers, the ways and means committee and the senate finance committee, we have tasked them with taking on the tax that writing the details of this tax bill within this template which we now agreed to.</p><p>So getting consensus between the White House, the senate and the house on a way forward on tax reform, makes it that much more of a viable enterprise. I feel much more confident that we're going to stick to landing on tax reform because we have now said we have consensus, here is the framework, let's go get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do you need to find revenue somewhere else? I mean, that border-adjustment tax -</p><p>RYAN: Of course, of course. So the answer is yes to that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- is going to raise a trillion dollars over 10 years.</p><p>RYAN: But the point - that's right. But the point I'm making is, with all the tools we have to make sure that we are revenue estimate our tax reform bills, we take into consideration economic growth effects. That helps a great deal. So from a traditional static basis which is what people describe it as, this will be a tax cut, but we will be able to do this in such a way that it conforms to our reconciliation rules, we can get this passed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you are expecting three percent growth at some point to take hold.</p><p>RYAN: I don't think we can get to three percent growth without tax reform. I really believe the secret to getting three percent growth which clearly is a goal we can he achieve in this country, regulatory relief, working on labor supply, you know, welfare to work but tax reform, you can't get the three percent growth in my opinion without tax reform.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci under fire this morning after a profanity-laced interview in the New Yorker saying this. I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to - expletive, my own expletive. I'm not trying to build my brand off the expletive, strength of the president, I'm here to serve the country. He then slammed the White House chief of staff <person><nameText>Reince Priebus </nameText></person>saying this. They'll be fired by me, I fired one guy the other day, I have three to four people to fire tomorrow.</p><p><person><nameText>Reince Priebus, </nameText></person>if you want to leak something he will be asked to resign very shortly. Reince is a expletive, paranoid, schizophrenic, a paranoiac. Scaramucci then tweeted this, I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for Trump's agenda, #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. And I made a mistake in trusting a reporter, it won't happen again. Wow. Certainly he has been passionate about the agenda. But this colorful language, I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The White House just looks like a mess.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It does.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It -- and it's one thing to - and Anthony Scaramucci, friend of this program, personal friend of ours, former co-host of Wall Street Week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It just looks like a mess and when it's just the president, who is tweeting, that's one thing, I think people are accustomed to that. He says, he speaks his mind, he, you know, says exactly what he means or whatever, he feels like at the moment. But when -- if you bring somebody in as communications director and this is the way that they are communicating, I think that you know what? Everything is going to change from this day forward in terms of how Anthony conducts himself. I know him well enough to believe that.</p><p>HAGLUND: And, you know, within the White House though, there are two things that incentivizing these leaks. One is the healthy completion environment that's being fostered because that's how people can wine up each other, and then the second is the fact that people know within the administration that Donald Trump pays attention to how he's covered in the media so people can leak something or, you know, they know they're having influence on that way. So that needs to come under control.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAGLUND: I mean, that needs to come under control than anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or outrageous.</p><p>HAGLUND: Oh, they are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And his anger --</p><p>HAGLUND: And so much it would have to do with the management.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's why he's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And his anger is justified and what he's trying to do to button up these leaks out of the White House.</p><p>HAGLUND: You have to be careful not to be the star though, remember how the president doesn't like it when people in his administration become the star though.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Take a break. When we come back, American diplomats told to get their families out of Venezuela. The new concerns ahead of next week's controversial vote. Then does Jeff Immelt already have a job? Why Uber may be ready to hand the keys to the outgoing CEO of General Electric. New name on the short list. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The crisis in Venezuela is growing, U.S. embassy employee are now being advised to leave the country immediately. Cheryl Casone with the story now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. And things have just deteriorated there so quickly in Venezuela, Maria. Violent protests broke out again just days before this controversy election is set to be held. So in response, the state department here has ordered family members of Americans working at the embassy in Caracas to leave the country. So the American employees are being given the option to join them if they want, the employees but family members need to go. Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government has banned protests for the next five days. Despite that though, opposition leaders have called for a massive march today, fearing danger, many people have been stocking up on food and have been staying in their homes in Venezuela.</p><p>Well, another high-profile candidate is topping the list -- the short list anyway, for Uber's CEO position which is still open. Uber now reportedly considering G.E. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt who's going to be stepping down from his current role at the end of next month. So The Wall Street Journal says that Uber search committee has had active discussions with Immelt.</p><p>Meanwhile, another potential candidate, Meg Whitman saying she is not planning to change jobs. The Hewlett-Packard CEO tweeted quote this, \"We have a lot of work still to do at HPE and I'm not going anywhere. Uber CEO will not be Meg Whitman. Mic drop for Meg Whitman. OK. Well, earnings coming in just a few moments ago from ExxonMobil. These guys, the numbers actually mixed for us this morning. Earnings per share missed the estimate from the street. Revenue did beat forecasts though. This is a Dow component remember, it's under pressure in the premarket down almost two percent. We already have the futures point lower, Maria. So this could be another piece of the puzzle. We'll see he what GDP does. But there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For sure. And earnings really driving the story all week because this is the busiest week of the second quarter , Cheryl. Thank you. Coming up. Amazon shares down as well after second quarter earnings disappointed last night. What the report means to the technology sector. Amazon down three and a quarter percent right now. Plus, we are moments away from the first reading of second quarter GDP. We are breaking down the strength of the economy estimates, 2.6 percent growth for the second quarter is what we're looking for. It's out in 10 minutes. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Earnings news driving the story on Wall Street, certainly driving markets, Amazon reported a second quarter earnings last night. It was a disappointment, stock is down. The company posted mixed results. Missing on the bottom line but beating on revenue, revenue was up 25 percent year-over-year, but as you see, the earnings were down sharply from the estimate. Joining us now, Overtsock.com CEO Patrick Byrne. Patrick, good to see you with your --</p><p>PATRICK BYRNE, CEO, OVERSTOCK.COM: Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- Make America Grateful Again. Nice hat.</p><p>BYRNE: Thank you. I thought you would appreciate it, I thought you might like Jerry. Are you grateful (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course. Yes. And I'm happy you have the hat on because we all need to be grateful and you're right.</p><p>BYRNE: And we don't feel a lot of gratefulness in American discourse these days, do we?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Patrick, you're a competitor of Amazon. What do I make of what's going on in retail right now when you see, you know, online versus brick and mortar. We see what's happening to the malls. It feels like online is really taking over, Patrick.</p><p>BYRNE: Well, you know, every putt makes somebody happy. The malls, 40 years ago, everyone was up in arms, how the malls were driving out the small stores. So yes, the internet does have advantage. I do think the best model, the one that's going to win overall is a hybrid of brick and click, the online somehow mixed with local stores which is the direction I hear Amazon is going to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. For sure. I want get to -- you have a big announcement to make exclusively on this program but first, before we get to the new shopping option, how would you characterize business right now, Patrick? We're waiting on the GDP to come out in a few minutes, trying to get a sense where economy is. What are you seeing from consumers?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, I can -- good question, consumers are back, people are spending. People are spending again, the online marketing has gotten so competitive, people are really rushing in to especially or home goods and furniture, a lot of people come into that and drive really -- I think distorting the marketing, you know, they're losing hundreds of millions of dollars. It's kind of tough to compete with people like that but -- so -- but I think the economy is actually quite brittle, and I would expect once they turn -- I think that the -- I think that it's brittle and someday -- some quarter soon we're going to start - it's going to start probably sinking back into a recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, sinking back into a recession. So, do you think tax reform moves the needle on growth? I mean, what is it going to take to get people spending again, and how soon off is a recession?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, it's when -- we have a cheap money policy. They're inflating the whole economy as they did 10 years ago with cheap money and it comes to, you know, the high -- any expansion this brought about by cheap credit ends with a crash. And that's what's going to happen and some point, there will be a dollar crisis. Your guy, Peter Schiff that you have on sometime, he's the eye who understands it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, for sure. I mean, the cheap money has been the case for the last decade. Now, we know that the fed is about to raise interest rates. They already started obviously this year. You wonder if higher rates are going to smash any economic recovery that's just gaining traction.</p><p>BYRNE: Well, I think it will - it will keep them - when - once they raise interest rates, we'll stop for this asset, bubble in the stock market and what's really driving spending as people's stocks go up, they start thinking maybe they made 80,000 this year but their 401(k) went from 300 to 400 and that they live like they spent like they made 180,000. And a good - about seven percent of our economy is just falling from that wealth effect, it will go away as soon as they stop inflating the stock market from cheap money.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Al right. Let's talk about the exclusive, you are making an announcement on the show. Tell us about Overstocks' new shopping option.</p><p>BYRNE: We have just launched the new tab, last night of midnights cars, it's in Beta, we're looking for feedback, it's an excellent car site and I have to say I think it's as good as anything on the net. It got four million cars, like cars.com and the other trader but in our case you can -- you can -- you can shop using all our technology, find your car, you can finance it and you can buy warrantees, they - it's the only place you can finance and get funded immediately online without talking to people. You can buy warranty and I think for the first people with online warranty protection for cars, it's a really killer new site, it's a tab at Overstock.com.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, that's amazing. People buy cars online. How prevalent is that?</p><p>BYRNE: Oh, I think it's about a quarter of the market now. At least they do their initial finding and one thing that's also unique about ours is you can -- women are going to love this, you can find the car you want at the dealer and for thousands of dealers, we're hooked up, we built an anonymous negotiation tools, you can negotiate with that guy on the car lot without ever him knowing your name and address and such. So we built functionality as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's interesting. Yes. Because this is going to overall be another way to obviously grow at Overstock. Is this - is this a pivot in terms of where you get revenue growth in the future? Is it changing business?</p><p>BYRNE: Not a pivot. In fact, we think it harnesses the technology to great shopping and finding technology we've already built in a new direction. We have 30 to 40 million (INAUDIBLE) a month and we're adding out the kinds of products we sell. Our motto today is really been dream homes for all, we're trying to get people to understand you can really have a much nicer home than you might otherwise would if you -- if you shopped through Overstock.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BYRNE: Now we're taking sort of every good home has a garage and every garage has a car. So, it's just another thing to your home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool stuff, Patrick. Real quick, recession this year or next year, is that the kind of timeframe you're talking about?</p><p>BYRNE: Yes, I do. I think unravels. It's a big confidence game and once confidence probably staring in Washington, once that unravels it will hit the broader economy I'm afraid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Patrick, we'll leave it there. Great to see you, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>BYRNE: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Make America grateful again. Patrick Byrns joining us there with the hat. We'll see you soon, sir. Thank you. Up next, we're waiting on the first reading of second quarter GDP. It's coming right after this short break. Stay right here. We're taking a look at how strong is the economy really is. Then Uber for the elderly, how one company found success by embracing ride-sharing for senior citizens, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Breaking news, we are waiting the commerce department's first estimate of second quarter GDP. It's going to be out in 10 seconds. The estimate is for 2.6 percent economic growth for the second quarter. We want to bring in to the conversation, Global Economics Editor with The Wall Street Journal, Jon Hilsenrath is with us. And Jon, the numbers are going to hit any second here. But interesting to note that we are expecting pretty good growth.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR AND GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Right. We're expecting -</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are just getting GDP and it is 2.6 percent growth to the second quarter. That is very much in line with what people were expecting, your reaction.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That is spot-on. Basically what it means is we got through the first half of the year, with surprise, surprise two percent growth because we had careful slow growth in the first quarter then it came back in the second. You know what we have is an economy that is still going in a very disappointing but steady rate. We are now into the 8th year of this expansion. There are not a lot of signs that it is going to accelerate but there also aren't a lot of signs that it's going to end. We are just puttering along.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I just want to tell you that the first quarter was revised lower. The first quarter is now being revised, Jon, to show growth 1.2 percent versus an estimate of or initial reading of 1.4 percent. This is not a great number. This is really in line with, Dagen, I know it's in line with estimate 2.6 percent. What they were expecting is not a great number.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It is not and Jon, again, we have not grown as an economy at three percent or higher in a decade. The entire Obama term, both terms, is anything going on because we see failure of the health care reform tax reform who knows where that goes, is anything happening here or even globally that is going to get us at a faster rate than looking at a second-quarter?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Two things have to happen in the economy. It's just basic econ 101 to get is to grow faster you either need labor force to be growing faster, people produce stuff, or you need the labor force to be more productive. Productivity and labor force drives growth. And if anything is going to happen in Washington to support that, it has to be with those objectives in mind. How do we get people back into the workforce? How do we give incentives to work more, to work smarter, more productively? So you know, frankly I personally think we spend a lot of time talking about what is going on in Washington, but a lot of it has to happen in the private sector. The vast majority of economic activity in the American economy comes from the private sector.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND MANAGING PARTNER, RECON CAPITAL: Jon, real quick. I am glad you're bringing that up because our tax system is convoluted and complex and no efficient decision making happening because of that so if we get a simple tax system more transparent that can stoke economic growth, can we see numbers that the administration is talking about? They are talking about three percent growth; they're talking about even upwards of four percent growth. If we get tax cuts that come through, can we get those numbers that this administration is advertising?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think tax can help. The question is how much can it help. And you have to realize that it's going gains major headwinds. The baby boomers are retiring. A lot of people are leaving labor force. How much can tax reform change the incentives of people to stay in the labor force and keep working? I think it can help. But can it get us to three percent? Those are huge demographic factors at play. And then the other question is corporate tax reform, will that give businesses an incentive to invest more in United States. And that is that is again, a possibility but we have -- because productivity is so slow and in part education of the workforce frankly lagging. You know, you have to wonder how far that is going, three percent every other independent analysis that I look at says three percent is a very ambitious goal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. In fact, House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>said that three percent can only happen with tax reform. He joined me yesterday, and we've got an exclusive this morning. He said before the Republican Senate Health Care Bill that he needs to see tax reform. He outlined how Obamacare spending directly impacts tax reform.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well you know, I think the Republican Party clearly needs a victory on taxes the longer they get hung up on this health care debate the harder it is to achieve that. So, Ryan and other Republican leaders came out yesterday with a statement of principles that they have got towards tax reform. And the most concrete thing in that statement of principles was that they're dropping this idea called border-adjustment tax. That was another trillion dollars of revenue that they thought they were going to get. The fact that they are dropping that suggests to me that a 50 percent corporate tax, 15 percent corporate tax rate looks less likely now we might be talking about something in the low to mid-20s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So again, they're going backward on a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. He wouldn't commit to corporate rate. I did ask about that last night. He certainly is married to the idea that in order to see the needle move on economic growth. You need tax reform.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think that he is right in getting to three percent but it is not the only thing that needs to happen to get to three percent growth. I think it helps to move the needle in that direction but he talked about other things like labor force regulatory reform. And I'll throw that out something else out there which is a hot-button issue for a lot of people, immigration, the fact of the matter is that domestic labor force growth is slowing. You know, one of the secret ingredients the United States has always had to labor force growth is that we bring in people, we welcome outsiders, we welcome immigrants. What is our immigration policy and how does that fit into the need for faster-growing labor force?</p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, PRESIDENT, HAGLUND FOUNDATION: Jon, Kirsten Haglund here. You talk about labor force growth and <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>just mentioned it. However, we have seen under employment, unemployment rate has gone down which is great. You still have under employment people working several different jobs without benefits as well as wages, really not going up and remaining stagnant. And then if corporate tax rate doesn't go down, that will cause a lot of companies to send out that cash and not take those risks even more. So what effect does that play into this labor workforce that you are talking about? And how do we improve that situation?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you put your finger on one big issue is that there are still huge overhanging part time workers, people have part-time jobs who want something full time but it looks like, we have unemployment rate of 4.3 percent. It looks like we are getting to a point in this business cycle where wages should start picking up again. The fact that inflation is very low means that even the wage growth is slow and people are keeping more of the money they make because inflation, you know, look at gasoline prices, you know inflation isn't eating away purchasing power of what they got. But this certainly is not your grandfather's economy where everybody who wants a job can go out and get one and a lot of people in jobs that isn't meeting all needs.</p><p>KELLY: Jon, real quick. You mentioned the purchasing power that we're talking about how the dollar has gone down six percent the first half of this year. What that does that doesn't incentivize companies to invest in property planning equipment because dollars are worth less. Why stock buybacks labor participation rates are low, that's why you are seeing wages stagnate. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, a couple points, on the dollar, one is that the dollar has softened. But that was after a long period of improvement so we have to look at it over a longer stretch of time. The other thing I would say is President Trump has pointed to the fact that it is kind of a two-way street on the dollar. On one hand, it undermines when dollar is weak and it undermines purchasing power of the current of the currency but it also helps exports. We did an interview with the President this week talking about Janet Yellen. He said he actually likes a weaker dollar because he likes the benefits to the export sector from that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon, does 2.3 percent yield on the tenure make sense to you? You talked about low inflation, the lack of wage growth. That might be one reason but that's still based on where it is, the close yesterday still seems to indicate people are betting on an economy that is slower than 2.6 percent rate we just got.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So Dagen, it makes sense on two fronts and worrisome on one front. It makes sense because all these measures of inflation we look at are extremely low and when inflation is low, bond yields are low. It also makes sense because look at Venezuela, look at China, look at Russia. There are a lot of wealthy people in chaotic places who want to get money the heck out of where it is into safe assets like Treasury's. So a lot of money flowing into U.S. asset markets, particularly the Treasury, because it is worrisome I think because even though it is raising interest rates, longer term rates are very low, and that has been making over some periods of time. I don't think we are there for another bubble, I think we have to be looking over the next two, three, four years about the risks of some bubble showing up somewhere. Every day, Maria, you are reporting stock markets at new high, that is -- that feels good, but what point do they get too high as opposed to new high?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Patrick Burn just told us he is expecting recession this year or next year, Jon. With that, we know it's going on in retail as well. Jon, good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have a great weekend, Jon. Jon Hilsenrath, there. Coming up, it looks like a rough time for Amazon and Twitter. But is the technology dip just the thing you need to get it? Stuart Varney on why it may be time to look for opportunities with these declines. Then, Tesla owners getting revved up. The latest with the automakers finally begin deliveries of the Model 3 Sedan. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, shares of Starbucks are hitting over in the premarket this morning. The company missed earnings expectations and they reported the second quarter. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hear, Maria. (INAUDIBLE) roasted. That's actually right but not in a good day. Not like those coffee beans that we love. In fact, the stock has been down five, six percent throughout the morning. They had a sales miss, a revenue miss. So, some concerns but they did have some bright spots (INAUDIBLE) but it was a miss. The traffic improved, that's good, right? That turned from the last quarter. And the new CEO, Kevin Johnson, really is looking to China, long-term investments in China. That's where he sees a lot of growth. In fact, they plan to add around the globe 240,000 new jobs. I mean, that is a huge number over the next five years, which includes almost 70,000 right here in the United States. The analysts are mixed overall on Starbucks. It's down 6-1/2 percent.</p><p>Let's move to Tesla because Tesla which has had an amazing run over the last five years, will show you a chart. But take a look here because Tesla is up just one-third of one percent today. Today is a big day, we are finally going to see now the new Model 3, it arrives. Today is the day Elon Musk will give it out tonight to first 30 customers which actually are employees, and one goes to the South Broadcast tonight live on their stream. So, I don't know if this is going to be a sell on news, Maria, because the last two launches, they -- once the rubber met the road, they sold. So, that is like the same sort of phrase, I guess. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And looks beautiful. I can understand why there's all this hype around it. Nichole, thanks. We'll be watching this market. Amazon also focusing earnings last night, of course, the stock is slumping this morning, down 3-1/2 percent right now. The earnings came in well below analysts' expectations, a big decline. This is Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos briefly overtook Bill Gates as the world's richest man yesterday based on obviously the evaluations of their companies. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Stu, you see some opportunity here?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, look, Jeff Bezos has returned to his former business style, business model. Takes the money in, plows it all back into expansion, he's been doing that for 20 years, and it's been successful in terms of growing the business and growing the stock price. This time, we've got a pullback and a serious one, too, $37.00 down. I'm wondering, I think the question of the day is, will we see people buy on the dip? If Bezos is continuing to pursue what was a successful strategy, of plowing the money back into growth, then you might see a few people buy on this dip, but so far, premarket, they have not done that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And people just are not upset that you're not seeing profit growth at all. And this has been the case for a long time at Amazon. And once again, revenue was strong, but the earnings just not there.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. Well, they took their earnings -- they took -- they plowed profits back into expansion which is what everybody likes them to do. Here's another question, though, will Amazon's debacle if I could call it that, a huge drop at the opening bell. Will that translate into further declines for big tech? Is it a sign that big tech which has dominated this market all year, is now about to plateau and maybe come down a bit? Unanswered questions at this point, but we'll have answers for you in the next six or seven hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, we will be watching, Stu. We'll see you at the top of the hour. Thanks so much.</p><p>VARNEY: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Still to come, taking a ride-sharing to a whole new level. How one couple is reinventing the wheel within Uber for the elderly. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Move over millennials. One retired couple created a way to make ride-sharing more friendly for older citizens, senior citizens. It's catching Uber's attention as well. The nonprofit called \"Common Courtesy\" has a goal of extending Uber's convenience to seniors who don't have a smartphone or are not well-versed in using one. Joining us now are the cofounders of Common Courtesy, Bob and Anne Carr. Great to see you, guys. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BOB CARR, COFOUNDER, COMMON COURTESY: Absolutely, good morning.</p><p>ANNE CARR, COFOUNDER, COMMON COURTESY: Good morning. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How it works -- I think it's such a great idea for senior citizens. Is it sort of like an Access-A-Ride? I mean, that's really a bus that will handle several people, but this is one person in the car, right?</p><p>B. CARR: It -- of course, it's one person, with rideshare companies, but up to three people additionally can ride for the same fare, basically. So, we have some that are going to lunch, some that are individual or is more dignified, we believe.</p><p>A. CARR: Yes. And it's -- we call it \"personal transportation\" than --</p><p>B. CARR: Or as Anne calls it, micro-transportation.</p><p>A. CARR: Exactly.</p><p>B. CARR: So, it's a grading with mass transportation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's such a good idea. It's a great idea.</p><p>KELLY: And how does it -- how does it work with Lyft and Uber and how does that whole process? So, if I'm an elderly person and trying to get a rideshare?</p><p>A. CARR: OK.</p><p>B. CARR: We basically see ourselves as we've engineered this, as an intermediary for both Uber and Lyft. We have systems that are both using a concierge or a dispatch from our office for those people who don't have a smartphone or don't want to use a smartphone, they can call a toll-free number. There are others who very professionally use their -- proficiently use their smartphone. So --</p><p>A. CARR: We have our riders register with us. And they get a specific rider I.D. number that tracks them. So, some of them can put this system into their app, on their phone, and use their smartphone, but others just don't feel comfortable doing that, so they call the toll-free number, and we schedule the ride for them. And then you can watch it on the screen to make sure that they link up. It's a beautiful system.</p><p>B. CARR: Yes. And it has been re-engineered over time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you guys are not for profit?</p><p>A. CARR: Yes.</p><p>B. CARR: We are indeed. Yes. 10 years old.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wow. 10 years old. How do you -- how do you fund yourselves?</p><p>B. CARR: Well, there are a number of different revenues. We hadn't had not enough, I guess, is the short answer to that. Anne has been asking that from the very beginning, but we've created a number of different revenue streams that would involve, like, a little bit more, a little bit of an upcharge for the ride, or there are a certain chapters that we have that also we've taught how to do this, so they might pay a fee. I guess our biggest dream and wish is for donations to come into the -- to the nonprofit to help us from the bootstrap stage.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What happens --</p><p>A. CARR: And also community.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What happened when Uber found out about your company?</p><p>B. CARR: Well, we started working with Uber when they first moved to Atlanta. And they were -- they were a little bit standoffish because this is not their wheelhouse. And yet, over time, they warmed up to the idea, and I really believe they love it. Now, both Uber and Lyft we love. And, you know, what -- the thing that we see is that we are trying to expand Uber and Lyft's markets from -- get this from overserved to the underserved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, you're operating -- you're operating where right now and where do you hope to operate?</p><p>B. CARR: Well, throughout the U.S., we see no reason why it shouldn't expand throughout the U.S. Right now, we're -- we have chapters in -- several in Atlanta, and in Virginia Beach, Wichita, Kansas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Great idea, Bob and Anne. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. We'll be watching.</p><p>A. CARR: Well, thank you.</p><p>B. CARR: Thanks for having -- OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Bye Ann and Bob Carr.</p><p>B. CARR: Stay tuned. OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The co-founders of Common Courtesy. We'll take a break and then we've got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love my emoji. Let's get some final thoughts from this all- star panel. Kirsten Haglund.</p><p>HAGLUND: I can't wait to see week two with our new Communications Director. He better stay on message. And also happy anniversary to my hubby of five years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hey, happy anniversary. Kevin Kelly?</p><p>KELLY: The five-year anniversary is the wedding anniversary. Who would have (INAUDIBLE) it, Amazon, this is a buying opportunity. So, I don't know why you don't do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would be buying it then?</p><p>KELLY: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon Hilsenrath said these low long-term interest rates maybe signal another bubble if they stay in place. My prediction is it's an entitlement bubble. The Republicans can't even reform expanded Medicaid. We are in store for a debt crisis in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not good. Thanks for being with us. Have a great weekend, everybody. I'll see you on \"WALL STREET WEEK\" and \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\". \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now. Here's Stuart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017072803cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P48-WG41-DXH2-623J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 28, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00020JR</classCode><className>STARBUCKS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CYWF</classCode><className>TEAVANA HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS722515 SNACK &amp;

I'm  Gerri Willis.  Tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(voice-over):  The list of technical problems with ObamaCare growth.   No, there's trouble when even the big health insurers start to complain.   Also, no more overdraft fees.  The banks are being generous.  They just  might start refusing consumers an overdraft.  And federal workers double- dipping because it was shutdown.  Is that legal?  We are on the case  tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has been nearly three weeks since the ObamaCare exchanges opened,  and the backlash is growing.  You know, now is not just consumers  complaining that they can't get on, they can't get logged in and enroll.   It's insurers, the private sector who presumably would benefit from this  law, they say the system is not working.  Now, the latest problem insurance  companies getting bad information from the ObamaCare exchanges themselves.  </p><p>With us now United Health Group board member Gail Wilensky, she is  the former Medicare director under President George H. W. Bush.  John  Engates, the CTO of Rackspace.  And Paul Howard, the senior fellow at the  Manhattan Institute.  </p><p>Paul, let me start with you.  So, what are these insurers complaining  about?  What's going around for them?  It seems that this should all  benefit them.  </p><p>PAUL HOWARD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE:  Now, the files from e-commerce (ph)  are coming to them and they're saying, there is missing misinformation,  there's duplicate information, there's corrupt information, such that they  have to go back to the enrollees manually and say, is this information  correct.  If you just have a few thousand applications like we do today,  that is fine.  If you have millions, that is a disaster.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I am hearing that the system is enrolling spouses as  children.  I mean, it is crazy the kinds of mistakes going on.  John, to  you, what happened here?  I'm used to being online all the time.  I don't  have problems like this ever.  </p><p>JOHN ENGATES, RACKSPACE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER:  Right.  Well, this  is a brand new system, it's relatively untested system.  It was built over  the last probably six months or so and put together, you know, from you  know, sort of a rapid fire set of requirements.  And I think what you are  seeing is just the lack of, you know, testing and maturity of the platform  that powers this website.  This, you know, it's more or less like an e- commerce website.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Yes.</p><p>ENGATES:  Like you said, your online all the time.  And it should be  that same kind of experience.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, I have to tell you, mature, young, old, it ain't  working.  </p><p>ENGATES:  That's right.</p><p>WILLIS:  And it is shocking to me the degree that we're having  problems, the big numbers that we heard this week, one person of people who  visited this website were actually able to enroll.  Gail, you have called  this whole thing a complete screw up, you have been an HHS, you've seen  what goes on from the inside.  Tell us your view on these headlines you're  reading.  </p><p>GAIL WILENSKY, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BOARD MEMBER:  I think what may have  been a major contributing factor are two issues.  One is that a lot of  changes continued from CMS, the agency that is in charge of this for HHS to  go to the contractors very late.  And it meant that with the client putting  change specs to the people putting this together, they didn't really have  much of a change -- chance to test before it went online for the real.  The  reason I say that is some of the large vendors who are supporting the  federalist exchanged are the same vendors you are providing support to the  state exchanges that are working well.  </p><p>So, it makes you think there is something about what is going on in  those federal exchanges, and the instructions they were getting from the  government about how they do it.  I read a statistic today that was just  amazing to me.  This is from a Kaiser News reporter, normally a source,  friendly to the administration.  </p><p>WILLIS:  That's right.  </p><p>WILENSKY:  It took him 17 days and 63 attempts in order to enroll.   Clearly it's got to fix that, or people are going to go beyond frustration.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Wow, John, I just want to get you and what Gail saying here  about what happened with the exchanges, the same company, that some of the  same vendors used on the status changes as the federal exchange, that's  just she just said.  She says, there's something about the way the Fed did  this, that screwed it up.  What do you say?  What do think?  You're an  expert on this.  </p><p>ENGATES:  Yes.  So, this is a massive integration project that  crossed a number of departments probably spread out in many states and many  federal agencies.  And that is a big job, that's a big task.  And you have  to have expertise in doing that.  And obviously, these government  contractors do this kind of work, but maybe they did not have it experience  that the scale, maybe they didn't have the time to do the legwork that they  needed to do to pull together the agencies that are involved.  I mean, if  you imagine what is going on here, the system is looking up data in a  variety of services and data bases all over the counter basically.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, that's true.  It's bringing together a lot.  But they  had two in a half years to do it, Paul.  And now we are hearing this  company CGI, this is behind all of this, this is a Canadian company.  It's  not even an American company which I think is really funny.  There are big  time government contractor.  The government has been better going with the  same guys to develop Google or Amazon or Twitter or Facebook.  </p><p>HOWARD:  Right.  So, the government procurement rules actually favor  people have done business with the government before, have large lobby arms  in Congress.  Obviously, if you went with somebody like Google or Adele,  you would be better off at this point.  CMS also made a critical decision  that it was going to be the quarterback for all the private contractors  instead of contracting that decision now to somebody who was experience  that kind of integration.  CMS is not known of its IT healthcare expertise,  so that was probably also a critical problem.</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, there is a lot going on here Gail.  You were involved  with the Medicare prescription drug program, the roll out of that.  And I  remember it was originally criticized for being too complicated.  That was  the media's problem with it.  Did it go better than ObamaCare is? </p><p>WILENSKY:  It certainly did not have these kinds of problems.  Every  new program has some start up problems.  Everyone knew October 1st was  going to be a bit rocky and bumpy, as January 1st will be for sure.  I do  not think anyone anticipated that kind of problems that we're seeing to  multiple attempts, people who go part way through, get an error message and  get thrown off.  This is beyond any expectations that I have heard about.   The administration has until the middle of November to get all of these  problems reasonably fixed or there's going to be great difficulty in having  an effective January 1st.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, they're setting up a situation where people are  going to break the law because they don't have a way of getting signed on  legally.  I think that's one of the major stories is not being reported  right now, Paul.  What do you say to this inability to get this thing  together and now we're starting to hear some insurers might actually start  their own private exchange because they cannot get anything done with the  Obamacare network.  </p><p>HOWARD:  Right.  It is a real problem for the insurers, if the only  people who get through this process and get enrolled are desperate and  sick.  That creates a bad health risk for insurers --  </p><p>WILLIS:  But it's not just those people.  It's everybody.  Nobody can  get signed on.  One percent of the people, one percent of the people who  went on this site could actually enroll.    </p><p>HOWARD:  Right.  But that young healthy person might give up after the  first time.  A desperate sick person might go 50 or 60 times to get  through.  Health insurers are concerned they're going to be left holding  the bag.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Hey, John, if you were designing a site and have the kinds  of situations, reactions that this exchange is having, would you keep that  job or would they replace you with somebody else? </p><p>ENGATES:  We would be fired.  We would be fired for sure.  As a  service provider you have to deliver and you've got to do these kinds of  things, you know, sort of for the maximum up time and the performance of  the site.  And, you know, this one is not performing and I think you  probably get fired.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I want everybody to jump in on this.  But Gail, I start with  you.  Congressman Tim Huelskamp said this week, he said, this is so  problematic, this rollout that we should delay the individual mandate for a  year not only that, not only should we, but he predicted the president  would.  What do you make of that? </p><p>WILENSKY:  Well, this issue has been raised as soon as the president  of administration pushed back the employer mandate for a year.  Why should  we have employers getting an extra year, but insist that individuals must  have insurance or pay a penalty.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Right.</p><p>WILENSKY:  I think the congressman is raising a very important point  that if this problem does not get fixed quickly it is going to be very  difficult to hold people accountable for not having insurance penalizing  them if they don't when they have a reasonable response of saying, I tried.   You've made it so difficult, I could not do it.  So, I said, I think there  is window may be up to a month, if it is not solved, there's going to be a  lot of bipartisan pressure to start in this direction of saying, we need  more time, we need more enrollment, we need more time before people are  penalized.  So, I would not be surprised if this happens.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Paul, do you think the president will back off? </p><p>HOWARD:  If you'd ask me, two and a half weeks, there was no way, it's  unthinkable the president would do that.  But if this trend continues, and  he's going to get an earful from the insurance companies, from the  community backers like even the Robert Gibbs as reclined of the Washington  Post have said, look, this is a failure right now.  They do have to get  things cleaned up very quickly.  Things which were once unthinkable become  thinkable.  </p><p>WILLIS:  John, how long would it take you to fix this thing if you  were in charge? </p><p>ENGATES:  I think we could do it in few weeks.  </p><p>WILLIS:  What's that?  </p><p>ENGATES:  I think we could do it in a couple of weeks.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Really?</p><p>ENGATES:  Honestly, I think that it could be done.  Yes.  I mean,  well, it depends on where the problem is honestly.  I think that one of the  things I would do immediately is start to simplify the site to make it  easier for customers, our users to at least compare and understand what is  going on.  And then I would re-architect certain portions of the side to go  faster and be more streamlined.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Faster, streamlined.  That is what we expect out of an online  site.  Gail, John and Paul, thanks for coming on tonight.  </p><p>ENGATES:  Sure.</p><p>WILLIS:  Great conversation.  Really interesting.  So, we've got  about three weeks to get this thing fixed.  Thanks a bunch.  </p><p>HOWARD:  Thank you.  </p><p>WILENSKY:  Thanks.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you so much.  Now we want to know what you think.   Here is our question tonight.  Do you think President Obama will delay the  individual mandate?  Log on to Gerriwillis.com, vote on the right-hand side  of the screen, I will show you the results of the end of tonight's show.  </p><p>And, you know what, we have gotten so much response from you about  your concerns and questions about ObamaCare that we will do another call-in  show this Monday.  Look, we know you are squeezed.  It's you against  ObamaCare, you against the IRS, you against the big companies that want to  loot your bank account with fees.  We get it.  We're here to help.  So,  start e-mailing and tweeting us with your ObamaCare questions.  On Monday,  there's going to be a toll-free number like we usually do.  </p><p>You can call in during the show, ask me and a panel of experts.  We  get some great experts.  Ask these questions directly or even just make a  comment.  OK, we've got more to come this hour including the latest on new  study that shows sleeping may help prevent Alzheimer's.  </p><p>And next, one of the biggest banks in the U.S. is trying to get the  consumer on its side.  We will look at a plan by Bank of America to save  you money on fees.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Big news in banking.  You may soon have to say goodbye to  spending more than you have protection.  Remember that?  Bank of America is  considering a new checking account that prohibits overdrafts but protects  you from those $35 fees that can add up.  </p><p>Joining us now, Robin Sidel, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal.   Robin, great to have you here.  </p><p>ROBIN SIDEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  What is Bank of America talking about?  Keep in mind, they  are not saying that they're doing this.  This is all behind closed doors.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Right.  I mean, they have been spending the past year trying  to figure out how to overhaul their checking accounts.  A lot of other  banks have already done so.  And one of the things they're considering is  giving people the choice to not have overdraft, it won't be, you could  still choose between a couple of different checking accounts.  But one of  the accounts would not let you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So, this is great.  Because at the end of the day, what  these banks were typically doing is you have to opt out of what they called  overdraft protection.  But nobody ever saw the disclosure.  Nobody ever  took advantage of it.  You're out with your debit card and you're shopping,  and all of a sudden, you don't realize that you're charging for something  you don't have in your bank account.</p><p>SIDEL:  Right.</p><p>WILLIS:  A lot of people have been in that situation, and 35 bucks a  hit is a lot of money.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Uh-hm.  And consumer advocates and lawmakers and regulators  just really have slammed the industry, for disclosure, for lack of  transparency, and for the high level of fees.  So, they are addressing that  here.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I have to, you know, full confession here, I gave Bank of  America a very hard time whenever talking about introducing debit card  fees.  I cut off my Bank of America card on air.  If they do this, I'm  going to have to do something really positive because I think that is  great.  Why allow people to run up those fees when they do not even know  that they're doing it in many cases?  </p><p>SIDEL:  Right.  I mean, some people actually, it is interesting.   They're trying to start the line.  Some people actually like having that  protection and are willing to pay the $35 fee to buy or do whatever they  want.  </p><p>WILLIS:  But if that is the case, have them opt in, don't have me  have to decide to opt out of some named program that I don't even  understand.  Now, you say this might be part of a bigger program to  redefine checking.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  What is going on there? </p><p>SIDEL:  Well, they have been testing for the past year in  Massachusetts, Arizona, Georgia, a bunch of different pilot tests for  checking accounts.  And they're trying to figure out what to do.  And they  are also pretty sensitive to public criticism since the debit card fiasco  from a couple of years ago.  They are sensitive to that.  </p><p>WILLIS:  They are nervous.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Yes, of course they are.  </p><p>WILLIS:  They don't know what's going to happen.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Of course they are.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So, what could we see ultimately do you think? </p><p>SIDEL:  Well, I think you will probably see a couple of checking  accounts.  I think there's probably going to be a checking account geared  to the low end, to people who do not carry a lot of a high balance, who  don't have other relationships with the bank like a mortgage or credit  card.  I mean, that is kind of the way banks are going.  Some banks are  trying to, you know, push of those customers.  They do not want them  because checking accounts are actually expensive for the bank to maintain.   </p><p>WILLIS:  How much does it cost the bank to have a checking account? </p><p>SIDEL:  It can cost the bank a few hundred bucks a year to maintain a  checking account, and if you don't keep a lot of money in the bank and if  you don't have other relationships with the bank and they're not getting  any fees from you, that is the cost for them.  </p><p>WILLIS:  What do you take is the ultimate implications of what banks  are doing?  Because they are saying, we want those really wealthy customers  that could get mortgages from us, they invest with us, they have all kinds  of accounts with us.  But the other people, we want to get rid of them.   What would be the impact of that long-term? </p><p>SIDEL:  Well, I think you will going to just see different kinds of  accounts for different kinds of people.  Chase for example is pushing a  prepaid card called liquid that they are gearing towards the lower end.   There is no ability to overdraft on it either.  So, they're just trying to  manage their losses, but as well as still keep revenue from people who are  willing to pay.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, these prepaid cards, I got to tell you, they often  have big fees with them.  And I have not been a fan for that very reason.  </p><p>SIDEL:  They are changing, and the prepaid cards that are being  introduced now from the banks are actually a lot lower than the ones that  you used to be able to just buy at the drugstore or something.  So, because  -- they've got really slammed for those as well.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So, you think it's better for people to have a real  relationship with the bank other than just buying some card that they can  then use in any ATM?  I mean, at the end of the day, don't you want to  build a relationship that then leads to, you know, OK now we will going to  get the mortgage, maybe we get to the bank that we have our checking  account with, now we're going to get the loans for college.  Maybe we will  go to them too.  You know, the world has changed, but I hate to think that  people are so disconnected from the financial system that they have no  relationship.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Well, they are.  There are plenty of people who are, and there  are also people who don't want to put all their eggs in one basket, who  don't want to have a complete relationship with the bank.  You know, there  are plenty of people who don't like truck banks, don't trust them, are  afraid of them.  </p><p>WILLIS:  It's a lot of people.  I have to tell you, the banks brought  that on themselves in many ways with some of their policies.  And of  course, you know, the great recession did not do a lot to help that or the  bailouts.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Right.  And so, they are very aware of all that.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Robin, thanks for coming on.  Very good to see you.  Great  story.  We will continue to watch this.  It's going to be interesting.  </p><p>SIDEL:  Sure will.  Thanks.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>Later in the show, how the government shutdown is actually costing  the government more than if it stayed open.  And next, we answer the  question how you do that.  We'll tell you the best way to get a good  night's sleep and the real reason why it is so important.  Look at Bunny  sleeping.  Bunny.  Wake up, Bunny.  We are doing the show.  Come on, Bunny.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  All those sleepless nights are wreaking havoc on your brain.   Scientists linking sleep deprivation to Alzheimer's and dementia.  Stay  with us.  </p><p>WILLIS:  A warning tonight, for sleep deprived, Americans, you could  be more likely to developed Alzheimer's and dementia.  I know it's  disturbing, right?  It's a revolutionary new study, Scientists have  discovered that sleep detoxes your brain from harmful chemicals.  So, how  do you get enough shot eye to keep your mind and your body healthy?  </p><p>Joining me now, Dr. Selene Parekh, orthopedic surgery professor at  Duke University.  Boy, that's a fancy pants title there.  Dr. Selene, tell  us this basic thing about sort of resetting your brain with sleep.  How  does that work? </p><p>DR. SELENE PAREKH, DUKE LAW ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY PROFESSOR:  So, this  was a very interesting study from the University of Rochester, and what we  know is there are two basic cells in the brain.  One is called a neuron  which is the cell that's active when we're awake and working and doing  things that we do during the day, the other is called the Glial Cell, and  the Glial Cell supports the activity of the neuron.  This study showed us  that when we sleep, the neurons shrink.  And by shrinking, the Glial Cells  are able to pump fluid through the brain --  </p><p>WILLIS:  What fluid? </p><p>PAREKH:  Cerebral spinal fluid which surrounds all of our brains, the  Glial Cells can pumped in through the cells, and I should clear and detox  your brain while you're sleeping at night.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So what are you getting rid of when you detox? </p><p>PAREKH:  So, you're getting rid of toxic waste, toxic proteins,  basically the garbage that the cells create through the day.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I'm taking a nap in a couple of minutes here.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>OK, what kind of disorders could this new discovery treat? </p><p>PAREKH:  So, interestingly, we know that disorders such as  Alzheimer's, Parkinsons and other neurodegenerative diseases have a buildup  of toxic material.  So in theory, if you get sleep, you can detox the  brain.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  </p><p>PAREKH:  So potentially there might be a link here.  </p><p>WILLIS:  The other link you mentioned in the break that I was shocked  at, you said some Alzheimer's is linked to depression.  Tell us about that.  </p><p>PAREKH:  So there are some studies showing that elderly patients are  more prone to depression, and some of those patients are more prone to  having neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.  So we know that with  depression you have sleep issues, with sleep issues potentially there's a  link here with Alzheimer's.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You know, I'm listening to every word you're saying because  my grandmother had Alzheimer's when she died, and I know it's in just about  everybody's family.  So, tell us how to get a good night sleep.  </p><p>PAREKH:  So the basic ways to get a good night sleep, number one, have  a regular schedule so that you're sleeping normally, roughly at the same  time every night, sleep in a temp rate type of room so not too hot, not too  cold.  Stay away from stimulant type of drinks and activities that are  really going to get you hyper.  </p><p>WILLIS:  You don't take your iPad to bed with you, do you? </p><p>PAREKH:  Try not to, and really limit your bedroom for sleep related  activities.  So, you don't want to take your iPad, you don't want to sit  there and eat and do other things in the bedroom.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So, doctor, what about the length of time?  Is it eight  hours only or can you get away with six?  Five?  What do you say? </p><p>PAREKH:  So, I think the research is still out, we all do recommend  about eight hours of sleep, but some people get away with six, some people  more.  This study suggests that potentially sleeping more may be more  beneficial for you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So if I get up in the middle of the night and I'm wondering  around the house because I can't sleep, what do can you recommend to people  who have that problem of insomnia and want to get back to sleep and can't? </p><p>PAREKH:  So, a couple of things, try some relaxation techniques  whether it's relaxation music, relaxation scents, even yoga can actually  help to relax your nerves and try to get you to sleep a little better.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  So far I have a nap on the list, I have yoga on  the list.  You've got a long list of things that a lack of sleep  exacerbates including obesity, diabetes.  How is this so important -- mood  disorders, reproductive problems, the list goes on and on.  </p><p>It does go on and on.  So we know that during sleep your body repairs  itself.  So the bones, the tendons, the ligaments, the organs, your immune  system, all of this repairs itself.  I think this study is the tip of the  iceberg trying to understand how sleep really affects our whole body.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Wow.  Interesting stuff.  Thanks for coming on and telling  us about it.  </p><p>PAREKH:  Thanks.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I am going to take a long nap.  So, all right, coming up,  it's like a scene from a movie.  Two murders walk out of prison in Florida,  thanks to forged documents.  Now the manhunt is on, we'll explain.  </p><p>And next, the 16-day shutdown left thousands of workers furloughed,  stuck at home with what they thought was no pay, but now they're not only  getting back pay, they're double dipping.  Our legal panel weighs in next.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  A double paid vacation paid for you, by you, that it, the  taxpayer.  In case you needed another reason to be mad at the government,  some federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown also got  unemployment benefits despite receiving back pay.  Hmm, is this legal?  Do  we have cause?  Can we bring an action against the government?  Joining me  now, Bill Frumkin, attorney at Frumkin &amp; Hunter.  And Fox News legal  analyst Lis Wiehl.  All right, Lis, should these people get this money?</p><p>LIS WIEHL, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST:  No!  Wait a second!  OK, you get  to go on vacation, you didn't want that vacation, I understand it.  You  should get the back pay, I understand that, from the feds, because you're a  federal employee.  But by the time you get this back pay you've already  gone to the state, you've got unemployment, you have to give that back to  the state.  Because who else was paying for it, it was taxpayers, we're all  paying for that's not right.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And, Bill, you have an argument against it?</p><p>BILL FRUMKIN, FRUMKIN &amp; HUNTER ATTORNEY:  Of course.  Of course, I do.   Let's pretend the two of you are working for a government-sponsored  station, and they say to you ...</p><p>WIEHL:  Analyze ...</p><p>FRUMKIN:  You know what?  We want you to now, you know, take  unemployment, you are not going to be able to work, you have - bills aren't  furloughed, you still have to pay your car, your rent, your mortgage, you  this or your that, you don't know if you're going to get paid in the end,  and you know what?  We're going to pay you a month from now when your claim  is ready to go.  The point is that it's like a night differential, it's  like overtime, working on the weekend, on a holiday.  It's a problem, and a  lot of people who weren't essential still worked even though they weren't  getting paid just to keep things going.</p><p>WIEHL:  But wait a second.  OK.  All right.  So, let's take your  premise as Gerri and I are working at this government-subsidized ...</p><p>WILLIS:  We must be at NPR.</p><p>WIEHL:  At NPR.</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm Elmo.  You're ...</p><p>WIEHL:  I don't know - we're at NPR, considered, buy anyway, OK, so I  take your premise at that point.  You're right, people have to pay their  bills, and what really upset me about the shutdown, one of the things was,  it's always, you know, it's the secretaries and it's the people ...</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Yes.</p><p>WIEHL:  Not the high roll ...</p><p>FRUMKIN:  That's correct.</p><p>WIEHL:  I got that.  But when they do get that shut back from - which  says, here is your money that you would have received, so you could have  paid, you know, all those bills could have been paid.  Then, you can't  double dip.  Then you say, OK, those bills that you've got to give it back  to the ...</p><p>WILLIS:  Bill, you know, like, this makes a lot of sense.  So now  we're paying them twice ...</p><p>WIEHL:  Right.</p><p>WILLIS:  And you do realize, there's a one percent pay increase in  that bill.  They're going to get a pay increase on top of everything else.  </p><p>FRUMKIN:  OK, well, listen, this is true.  But not everybody lives  with, you know, a large bank account.  People live check to check.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  There's a lot of stress.</p><p>WILLIS:  True.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  There's a lot of issues.</p><p>WIEHL:  But they're already getting the checks from the Fed, that's  the point.  </p><p>FRUMKIN:  Yes, but the point is during that period of time, this  uncertainty of which is quite uncertain and could happen again very  quickly, they're living without not knowing whether they are going to be  able to pay their bills.</p><p>WIEHL:  But once that federal check -- that's what I'm saying, once  that federal check comes in, which the feds have promised, right?  Then the  state should say, and by the way, most states -- Oregon is very unusual in  this way -- that you must pay it back.</p><p>WILLIS:  Let me tell you.  </p><p>FRUMKIN:  I don't disagree that it's unusual, but there is some method  to the madness.  How are those people going to pay their bills?</p><p>WIEHL:  They've already paid them.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Not cash.  They don't have more cash.</p><p>WILLIS:  All right, hang on a second here, because there's an  important number I want to get across to our viewers here.  This is 43  million, that is the pay for furloughed workers.  77,000 of them receiving  $43 million.  So I still, I'm still mystified.  So I get the unemployment  money, right?  And let me tell you, the government was out there telling  people how to go about doing this.  It wasn't like you had to figure it out  on your own.</p><p>WIEHL:  And that's OK.</p><p>WILLIS:  Then we're trying to help you.</p><p>WIEHL:  Right.</p><p>WILLIS:  But now I get another check.  I get a paid vacation.  I get a  paid - How is that fair? </p><p>WIEHL:  Double paid vacation.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  But it's not a paid vacation where you're going to the  Bahamas and knowing that you're going to have a job when you come back,  that you're going to be paid.  It's somewhat like pain and suffering type  money.  Now, listen, I understand ...</p><p>WIEHL:  Wait a second.  Wait a second.</p><p>WILLIS:  Oh! </p><p>WIEHL:  You're putting on punitive damages here?</p><p>WILLIS:  No.  That's punitive damages, this is pain and suffering.   But the point I'm making, this is really ...</p><p>WIEHL:  You already have pain and suffering, don't worry about this  ...</p><p>FRUMKIN:  It's only Oregon that -- it's only Oregon that decided to do  in this.</p><p>WIEHL:  By the way, it's Oregon.  You never say Oregon.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Well, you are not from Flushing.  So I can't tell you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WIEHL:  Washington State.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  But the point I want to make here is that there should be  uniformity amongst all the states on this and there also should be ...</p><p>WILLIS:  Uniformly they should pay the money back.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  But there should be, I say, different - separate rules for  people who are furloughed federal workers as opposed to private workers and  state workers who apply for unemployment.</p><p>WIEHL:  That's another - you just made my point again, thank you.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  OK.  How did I do that? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WIEHL:  That - because it puts federal employees at a higher level  than private employees or state employees.  It puts them at a better - it  put them at an advantage that private employees and state employees don't  have.  And by the way, we're talking numbers?  For Oregon, just Oregon  itself, $650,000 it's costing.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Yeah.  But is this ...</p><p>WIEHL:  That's a lot of money for a small state. </p><p>FRUMKIN:  Is this - are you at an advantage, if there's a political  fight that leaves you on the sidelines not knowing when you're going to be  able to pay your bills...</p><p>WIEHL:  But once you've got ...</p><p>FRUMKIN:  That - I don't see ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Wait, wait, wait, they knew this was coming.  This had been a  fight for two years.  Two years ongoing.</p><p>WIEHL:  Right.</p><p>WILLIS:  What you do is you set aside a penny or a shekel every week  to prepare.  </p><p>FRUMKIN:  Well, that - in a perfect world, you're absolutely right.   But it is ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRUMKIN:  I don't disagree, but ...</p><p>WIEHL:  Or using the state money, because you don't know.  You have  that uncertainty.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  I'm not against it.</p><p>WIEHL:  You take that state money.  But once you do have the certainty  of the fed money coming in ...</p><p>WILLIS:  You give that back.</p><p>WIEHL:  Give it back.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  But you know what?  There's an assumption there that people  are making enough money to save money, and unfortunately even if they work  for the government, that's not necessarily the case.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, look, I have nothing, I have no issue with taking  unemployment if you're unemployed.</p><p>WIEHL:  Right.</p><p>WILLIS:  That's fine by me.  But don't double dip, you know why?   Because it's not coming out of the pocket of Dow chemical, it's not coming  out of the pocket of Exxon, it's not coming out of the pocket of some big  tech company.  It's coming out of my pocket!</p><p>WIEHL:  Right.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  But remember, it's not like you're sitting on easy street  while that's happening.  It's just - you just ...</p><p>WILLIS:  No, and I'm not sitting on easy street either.</p><p>WIEHL:  (inaudible) sitting on easy street but the point is once  you've gotten the money back, once you've been repaid for the time you  didn't work, now you're back at your job, you give the money that the state  gave you.  That's just - this is fair ...</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Well, I do understand that ...</p><p>WILLIS:  I don't know how we're going to resolve this, guys.  </p><p>FRUMKIN:  I don't know that ...</p><p>WILLIS:  Last word, though.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Listen, I gave you extra ...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRUMKIN:  I understand exactly what you say, it's a very difficult  issue, but it's also not good to be people squeezed in a political fight.   And that's ...</p><p>WILLIS:  Amen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  ... squeezed in this political fight.  And let me tell you, I  couldn't agree with that more.  That's the best thing you've said through  the whole segment.  </p><p>FRUMKIN:  OK.  Well, I had to say something that was good.</p><p>WILLIS:  That was good.  You're always good, Bill.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Oh, thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you, Lis.  Great job.</p><p>FRUMKIN:  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  Tweet us, @gerriwillisfbn.  We want to know what you think  about that.  And here comes top trending.</p><p>Time now for a look at the stories you're clicking on tonight on  foxbusiness.com.  The S&amp;P 500 index rising further into record territory  today, thanks to strong earnings from some of the biggest U.S. companies;  General Electric and Morgan Stanley, all rose after reporting higher  profits than analysts expected.  As did Google, which sent shares of the  tech giant up past the $1,000 mark for the first time.  The stock had never  before surpassed $928 a share in regular trading since going public nine  years ago.  Google says, well, advertising prices continue to decline, a  larger number of people are now clicking on ads.</p><p>And commuters in San Francisco Bay Area are fuming mad over the second  transit strike in four months.  The walkout began after six months of on- again/off-again talks between Bay area rapid transit and its unions.  The  two sides can't reach an agreement on work rule issues.  And the Fox  Business Network is now live on Sirius XM radio.  Yeah.  And available to  the radio network's 25 million subscribers.  You can catch FBN -- this show  too -- on Sirius XM channel 113.  Welcome to all of you Sirius people out  there.</p><p>And those are some of the hot stories right now on foxbusiness.com.   When we come back, the story of Freddie the Frogcaster.  We'll tell you all  about it.  And next, the manhunt is on for two convicted killers who  escaped from a Florida prison using forged court documents.  What is going  on in the sunshine state?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Talk about your get out of jail free card, in Florida two  prisoners sentenced to life for murder, well, they somehow forged documents  releasing them from prison.  So now two very dangerous criminals are out  and on the loose.  How can this happen?  Joining us now a Florida criminal  defense attorney.  Regina Sambanan.  Regina, I can't say your last name.   Sambanan (ph)...</p><p>REGINA TSOMBANAKIS, FLORIDA CRIMINAL ATTORNEY:  Tsombanakis.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're so good at that, thank you.  Thanks for saving me on  that one.  I don't get how this happens more than once.  It happens twice,  not once, how could this possibly happen that they could forge these  documents in prison? </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Well, they can't.  </p><p>WILLIS: all right.  </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Somebody's helping them.  They don't have printers, they  don't have Internet, and we're talking about two people that are not in  jail for fraud, forgery or any type of crime like that, but for violent  crimes, one of them not even smart enough to wear a ski mask.  So, how are  they doing it?  They're not.  Someone's got to be helping them.  How do  these papers go through?  Someone's got to be paid to look the other way,  someone's got to be paid to do this.  It just doesn't make sense any other  way.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.  So somebody inside, that's what you're saying, right? </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  It'd have to be, in my opinion.</p><p>WILLIS:  Somebody inside the system that is getting these signatures  and helping them getting this information out which means there's probably  big bribes.  </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right?  Big bribes?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  And there's probably more than one person, absolutely,  because there's probably someone producing the documents, somebody has to  look the other way to process the documents.  I mean it could be more than  one person.  But these two inmates are not sophisticated to figure out how  to produce these documents, how to print these documents, how to get these  documents into the right hands to be released.</p><p>WILLIS:  So, is it possible that there are lots and lots of people  just like them who are out and shouldn't be?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  It is possible.  I don't think there's an abundance of  it, but it is possible.  These men just walked right out of jail.  I mean,  these are violent criminals.  And one on September 26th, red flagged.  How  come the other one got out on October 8th?  What's going on?</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  What is going on at this prison, you know?  I mean  people just walk out?  That should have been right there.</p><p>WILLIS:  So, apparently, apparently there was an announcement this  afternoon that they think these two guys or at least one of them is still  in the state, which shocks me that they haven't left.  But apparently ...</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  It shouldn't shock you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Do you think they'll catch up with them?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Yeah.  It shouldn't shock you, because they're in jail  for a reason.  Like I said, the guy didn't even wear a ski mask, OK?  He's  not forging documents.  You know.  Yes, he probably is still in the state.   They probably are staying right here in this -- but the problem is there's  victims.  And they got to look over their shoulder - and they're worried.   I mean you can't live in that kind of fear when the state's put the person  away.  </p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  Let me read the statement from the Florida  Department of Corrections.  Somebody's -- there's going to be a shoe to  fall here - I don't know who is that going to be, but here's what they say  for their part.  \"The department followed our procedures and protocols to  the letter, so in this instance, the department didn't do anything wrong.   And your response? </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  How about the department passing the buck?  Of course  they did something wrong.  Two people left the prison.  How can you sit  there and say you didn't do something wrong?  Where are these people?  How  did you not know in this?  I mean, please.  It's time for government to get  with it, get responsible.  You let these people out, there's something  going on in your prison, fix it.  Don't sit there and go, oh, I don't know  anything.  Well who would then?</p><p>WILLIS:  But who gets that ball rolling, Regina?  I mean how does -  what needs to happen next? </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  From the top.  From whoever's the warden, whoever's in  charge of that prison.</p><p>WILLIS:  How about the governor? </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  The Department of Corrections.</p><p>WILLIS:  How about the governor?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Yeah, how about the governor?  Exactly.  Somebody's got  to get involved.  We're risking people's lives.  They've killed before,  they probably may kill again, and these victims don't deserve this.  And we  don't deserve this.  </p><p>WILLIS:  No, I certainly agree.  </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  What's the point, you know?  If they can check in and  out of the hotel? </p><p>WILLIS:  Well put.  Regina Tsombanakis, thank you for coming on.  I  think I said it right that time.  I appreciate your time.</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Good.</p><p>WILLIS:  Good job.  </p><p>TSOMBANAKIS:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.  Well, still to come, Fox News meteorologist  Janice Dean is here, but she's not telling us the weekend forecast.  So,  look at her new book.  There she is right there.  After the break.  Freddy  the Frogcaster.  Well done.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  What does the frog have to do with forecasting?  More than  you might think what Freddy the Frog wants your kids to learn.  Coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  All right, some kids say they want to be a police officer or  a firefighter when they grow up, you know, you don't usually say  meteorologist when you're a little kid, but one author's hoping to change  all that.  Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean is here to talk about  her new children's book called \"Freddy the Froggcaster.\"  I love to say  that, and why she feels it's so important kids learn about the weather from  an early age.  You've got to tell us about this book, it's so adorable.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Thank you.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I've been able to page through it and look at it, it seems  like a great read for kids.</p><p>DEAN:  Did you learn something from it?</p><p>WILLIS:  I learned something every single minute.  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  I learned about cold fronts ...</p><p>DEAN:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  Of thunderstorm clouds.</p><p>DEAN:  Yep, I think it's important because I wanted to not only give  kids an introduction to weather, but also help parents discuss why things  happen in the atmosphere.  I think sometimes as parents if I wasn't a  meteorologist, I don't know if I would know what a cold front or a warm  front or a low pressure/high pressure is, and I think I explain that well  enough so that kids and parents can get involved in what's happening  outside, and I think that's really important.  I think kids at a young age  have an appreciation for weather.</p><p>WILLIS:  Oh, sure.  And it's the only thing anybody ever talks about,  so if you want your children to be part of the conversation ...</p><p>DEAN:  Right.</p><p>WILLIS:  They need to understand the weather.  </p><p>DEAN:  Absolutely.  And like you mentioned, it opens up our dialogue  with each other.  I ride the elevator every day here at Fox, it's a nice  day out here, Janice Dean, congratulations.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEAN:  Or is it going to rain on my parade tomorrow? </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DEAN:  So, you know, it brings us together as a community.  I think as  well if we see a bad storm go through our neighborhood, it also brings us  together to help one another.  Weather is always going to be a big part of  our lives, and I think if we can get kids at an early age to start  discovering it more, in the long term it's going to be good for everyone,  and it might inspire a new generation of meteorologists.</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, that's what I think is so interesting.  Because one of  the things you're saying tomorrow, I understand, in an op-ed editorial to  be published is that it's all about math and science.</p><p>DEAN:  Sure.</p><p>WILLIS:  And this is a way to get kids interested in that.  Tell us  how numbers contribute to weather forecasting.  </p><p>DEAN:  Well, it's all about computer models.  What we input into the  computer models to tell us what the forecast is going to bring, numbers,  temperatures, drop in pressure, barometer.  Numbers are important when it  comes to forecasting, and there's a lot of math, and there's is a lot of  science.  And we know as we get kids into schools these days if they're  going to compete on the world stage, they have to know math, science,  technology and engineering.  So those two, math and science, that's what  meteorology is all about.  So if we can get them interested at a young age  and think it's fun, maybe they will in turn think that math and science is  fun when they go ...</p><p>WILLIS:  Become an engineer, a meteorologist ...</p><p>DEAN:  Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS:  Who knows?  You know, the job openings, this is numbers from  2016, 16 percent of bachelor degrees will specialize in STEM, but the  number of jobs that are open, one million.  So we're not producing enough  kids to actually do these jobs.  Anything we can do to inspire them is a  positive, right? </p><p>DEAN:  Absolutely.  Yeah, of course.  And like I mentioned, when you  have an appreciation for weather and you want to learn about it, you're  going to learn about it in school, but it is a lot of math, it's a lot of  science.  I took something like -- that's called thermodynamics.  It sounds  scary, but it's fun when you can get all the numbers together.  And they  say this a lot, but weather is not an exact science.  It won't be.  We  can't really predict that perfect forecast yet.  But we'll certainly get  them encouraged to really love those summits.  </p><p>WILLIS:  One final question, why a frog?  How'd you come up with a  frog? </p><p>DEAN:  Well, the groundhog was taken.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DEAN:  Right?  And when I thought about it, I've always had a love of  frogs.  And, you know, Gerri, the interesting thing that I just learned  about recently that, you know, gave me inspiration that Freddy was the  right choice was that frogs, apparently, when a storm is coming they croak  louder.  How perfect is that? </p><p>WILLIS:  They know.  They know.</p><p>DEAN:  Plus, I can also say things like frogcaster, the Frogs News  Network, you know, it's cute names like Sally Croaker and Polly Woggins.  I  had a lot of fun.  It's a lot of great names, it's the illustration, Russ  Cox did all the illustrations, beautiful job, and at the back of the book  there's some educational purpose too.  There's a definition, a glossary of  all the terms that I use on television.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Every single day.</p><p>DEAN:  Yeah.</p><p>WILLIS:  I have to tell you, it's a great book.  Great reading.</p><p>DEAN:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  It's about at my level, now I think.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS:  Thanks for Janice, thanks for coming on.</p><p>DEAN:  Anytime.  </p><p>WILLIS: great job.  Appreciate it.  Well, if you can't get your hands  on the Freddy the Frogcaster costume, and you're still looking for some  Halloween ideas, tonight's top five might help.  The most popular costumes  of 2013, well, so far, number five is for those who want to go trick or  twerking, Miley Cyrus.  He MTV performance is leading to Teddy-bear  inspired teddies.  Mom and dad shouldn't see that.  Number four, break out  the camouflage so you can look like the cast of Duck Dynasty.  Think beards  and bandannas, you know, red neck chic.  Number three is a fox.  This is  from a viral video, in the same (inaudible) as Gangnam style, it's an  electronic dance song by a Norwegian artist.  Number two, characters from  \"Breaking Bad.\"  You can look like Walter White or Jesse Pinkman with a  yellow hazmat suit that you can buy online for about 45 bucks apiece.  And  the number one most popular Halloween costume of 2013, the minions from  \"Despicable Me.\"  I love that.  You can dress up your child as a small,  yellow, cylindrical creatures for about 35 bucks.  Costumes for mom and  dad, a little more expensive.  Other looks on the list, characters from the  \"Game of Thrones\" or the classic, Batman.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  The problems with Obamacare just don't stop.  As insurers are  now reporting the system is generating massive amounts of flawed data.  Do  you think these glitches will be enough to force the president to delay the  individual mandate?  Here is what some of you are posting on my Facebook  page.  Sandy says this, \"I think the backlash will be so bad they will  cancel it and transfer those folks in need to Medicaid.  Interesting.  And  Maxine writes this, \"No, because it would mean failure.\"  That is possible,  too.  We also asked this question on Geriwillis.com.  20 percent of you  said yes, 80 percent said no.  \"The president will not delay the mandate.\"   And finally, you know, I cannot get over how bad Obamacare is.  Look, I did  not expect it to be successful, but I did not expect it a disaster either,  and it has become just one more thing you have to figure out.  The  responsibility on your shoulders because the government sure is not helping  you.  </p><p>Look, I am getting tons of tweets, Facebook post, e-mails, all great  questions and all deserving answers.  So, we are stepping in again with  another call-in show on Monday.  Join us.  I have a panel of experts,  people who are not Obama-paid consultants to tell you the real deal on  Obamacare.  Look, we get it.  You are squeezed.  It is you against  Obamacare, you against the IRS.  You against the companies that see your  wallet as their bottom line.  So, we'll be there again.  I hope you will  join us Monday at 6:00 P.M.  That is it for tonight's \"WILLIS REPORT.\"   Thanks for joining us.  We will see you here Monday.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I'm Gerri Willis. Tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(voice-over): The list of technical problems with ObamaCare growth. No, there's trouble when even the big health insurers start to complain. Also, no more overdraft fees. The banks are being generous. They just might start refusing consumers an overdraft. And federal workers double- dipping because it was shutdown. Is that legal? We are on the case tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>It has been nearly three weeks since the ObamaCare exchanges opened, and the backlash is growing. You know, now is not just consumers complaining that they can't get on, they can't get logged in and enroll. It's insurers, the private sector who presumably would benefit from this law, they say the system is not working. Now, the latest problem insurance companies getting bad information from the ObamaCare exchanges themselves.</p><p/><p>With us now United Health Group board member Gail Wilensky, she is the former Medicare director under President George H. W. Bush. John Engates, the CTO of Rackspace. And Paul Howard, the senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.</p><p/><p>Paul, let me start with you. So, what are these insurers complaining about? What's going around for them? It seems that this should all benefit them.</p><p/><p>PAUL HOWARD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Now, the files from e-commerce (ph) are coming to them and they're saying, there is missing misinformation, there's duplicate information, there's corrupt information, such that they have to go back to the enrollees manually and say, is this information correct. If you just have a few thousand applications like we do today, that is fine. If you have millions, that is a disaster.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I am hearing that the system is enrolling spouses as children. I mean, it is crazy the kinds of mistakes going on. John, to you, what happened here? I'm used to being online all the time. I don't have problems like this ever.</p><p/><p>JOHN ENGATES, RACKSPACE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER: Right. Well, this is a brand new system, it's relatively untested system. It was built over the last probably six months or so and put together, you know, from you know, sort of a rapid fire set of requirements. And I think what you are seeing is just the lack of, you know, testing and maturity of the platform that powers this website. This, you know, it's more or less like an e- commerce website.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p/><p>ENGATES: Like you said, your online all the time. And it should be that same kind of experience.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, I have to tell you, mature, young, old, it ain't working.</p><p/><p>ENGATES: That's right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And it is shocking to me the degree that we're having problems, the big numbers that we heard this week, one person of people who visited this website were actually able to enroll. Gail, you have called this whole thing a complete screw up, you have been an HHS, you've seen what goes on from the inside. Tell us your view on these headlines you're reading.</p><p/><p>GAIL WILENSKY, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BOARD MEMBER: I think what may have been a major contributing factor are two issues. One is that a lot of changes continued from CMS, the agency that is in charge of this for HHS to go to the contractors very late. And it meant that with the client putting change specs to the people putting this together, they didn't really have much of a change -- chance to test before it went online for the real. The reason I say that is some of the large vendors who are supporting the federalist exchanged are the same vendors you are providing support to the state exchanges that are working well.</p><p/><p>So, it makes you think there is something about what is going on in those federal exchanges, and the instructions they were getting from the government about how they do it. I read a statistic today that was just amazing to me. This is from a Kaiser News reporter, normally a source, friendly to the administration.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's right.</p><p/><p>WILENSKY: It took him 17 days and 63 attempts in order to enroll. Clearly it's got to fix that, or people are going to go beyond frustration.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Wow, John, I just want to get you and what Gail saying here about what happened with the exchanges, the same company, that some of the same vendors used on the status changes as the federal exchange, that's just she just said. She says, there's something about the way the Fed did this, that screwed it up. What do you say? What do think? You're an expert on this.</p><p/><p>ENGATES: Yes. So, this is a massive integration project that crossed a number of departments probably spread out in many states and many federal agencies. And that is a big job, that's a big task. And you have to have expertise in doing that. And obviously, these government contractors do this kind of work, but maybe they did not have it experience that the scale, maybe they didn't have the time to do the legwork that they needed to do to pull together the agencies that are involved. I mean, if you imagine what is going on here, the system is looking up data in a variety of services and data bases all over the counter basically.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, that's true. It's bringing together a lot. But they had two in a half years to do it, Paul. And now we are hearing this company CGI, this is behind all of this, this is a Canadian company. It's not even an American company which I think is really funny. There are big time government contractor. The government has been better going with the same guys to develop Google or Amazon or Twitter or Facebook.</p><p/><p>HOWARD: Right. So, the government procurement rules actually favor people have done business with the government before, have large lobby arms in Congress. Obviously, if you went with somebody like Google or Adele, you would be better off at this point. CMS also made a critical decision that it was going to be the quarterback for all the private contractors instead of contracting that decision now to somebody who was experience that kind of integration. CMS is not known of its IT healthcare expertise, so that was probably also a critical problem.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, there is a lot going on here Gail. You were involved with the Medicare prescription drug program, the roll out of that. And I remember it was originally criticized for being too complicated. That was the media's problem with it. Did it go better than ObamaCare is?</p><p/><p>WILENSKY: It certainly did not have these kinds of problems. Every new program has some start up problems. Everyone knew October 1st was going to be a bit rocky and bumpy, as January 1st will be for sure. I do not think anyone anticipated that kind of problems that we're seeing to multiple attempts, people who go part way through, get an error message and get thrown off. This is beyond any expectations that I have heard about. The administration has until the middle of November to get all of these problems reasonably fixed or there's going to be great difficulty in having an effective January 1st.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, they're setting up a situation where people are going to break the law because they don't have a way of getting signed on legally. I think that's one of the major stories is not being reported right now, Paul. What do you say to this inability to get this thing together and now we're starting to hear some insurers might actually start their own private exchange because they cannot get anything done with the Obamacare network.</p><p/><p>HOWARD: Right. It is a real problem for the insurers, if the only people who get through this process and get enrolled are desperate and sick. That creates a bad health risk for insurers --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: But it's not just those people. It's everybody. Nobody can get signed on. One percent of the people, one percent of the people who went on this site could actually enroll.</p><p/><p>HOWARD: Right. But that young healthy person might give up after the first time. A desperate sick person might go 50 or 60 times to get through. Health insurers are concerned they're going to be left holding the bag.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Hey, John, if you were designing a site and have the kinds of situations, reactions that this exchange is having, would you keep that job or would they replace you with somebody else?</p><p/><p>ENGATES: We would be fired. We would be fired for sure. As a service provider you have to deliver and you've got to do these kinds of things, you know, sort of for the maximum up time and the performance of the site. And, you know, this one is not performing and I think you probably get fired.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I want everybody to jump in on this. But Gail, I start with you. Congressman Tim Huelskamp said this week, he said, this is so problematic, this rollout that we should delay the individual mandate for a year not only that, not only should we, but he predicted the president would. What do you make of that?</p><p/><p>WILENSKY: Well, this issue has been raised as soon as the president of administration pushed back the employer mandate for a year. Why should we have employers getting an extra year, but insist that individuals must have insurance or pay a penalty.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p/><p>WILENSKY: I think the congressman is raising a very important point that if this problem does not get fixed quickly it is going to be very difficult to hold people accountable for not having insurance penalizing them if they don't when they have a reasonable response of saying, I tried. You've made it so difficult, I could not do it. So, I said, I think there is window may be up to a month, if it is not solved, there's going to be a lot of bipartisan pressure to start in this direction of saying, we need more time, we need more enrollment, we need more time before people are penalized. So, I would not be surprised if this happens.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Paul, do you think the president will back off?</p><p/><p>HOWARD: If you'd ask me, two and a half weeks, there was no way, it's unthinkable the president would do that. But if this trend continues, and he's going to get an earful from the insurance companies, from the community backers like even the Robert Gibbs as reclined of the Washington Post have said, look, this is a failure right now. They do have to get things cleaned up very quickly. Things which were once unthinkable become thinkable.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: John, how long would it take you to fix this thing if you were in charge?</p><p/><p>ENGATES: I think we could do it in few weeks.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What's that?</p><p/><p>ENGATES: I think we could do it in a couple of weeks.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Really?</p><p/><p>ENGATES: Honestly, I think that it could be done. Yes. I mean, well, it depends on where the problem is honestly. I think that one of the things I would do immediately is start to simplify the site to make it easier for customers, our users to at least compare and understand what is going on. And then I would re-architect certain portions of the side to go faster and be more streamlined.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Faster, streamlined. That is what we expect out of an online site. Gail, John and Paul, thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p/><p>ENGATES: Sure.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Great conversation. Really interesting. So, we've got about three weeks to get this thing fixed. Thanks a bunch.</p><p/><p>HOWARD: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILENSKY: Thanks.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Thank you so much. Now we want to know what you think. Here is our question tonight. Do you think President Obama will delay the individual mandate? Log on to Gerriwillis.com, vote on the right-hand side of the screen, I will show you the results of the end of tonight's show.</p><p/><p>And, you know what, we have gotten so much response from you about your concerns and questions about ObamaCare that we will do another call-in show this Monday. Look, we know you are squeezed. It's you against ObamaCare, you against the IRS, you against the big companies that want to loot your bank account with fees. We get it. We're here to help. So, start e-mailing and tweeting us with your ObamaCare questions. On Monday, there's going to be a toll-free number like we usually do.</p><p/><p>You can call in during the show, ask me and a panel of experts. We get some great experts. Ask these questions directly or even just make a comment. OK, we've got more to come this hour including the latest on new study that shows sleeping may help prevent Alzheimer's.</p><p/><p>And next, one of the biggest banks in the U.S. is trying to get the consumer on its side. We will look at a plan by Bank of America to save you money on fees.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Big news in banking. You may soon have to say goodbye to spending more than you have protection. Remember that? Bank of America is considering a new checking account that prohibits overdrafts but protects you from those $35 fees that can add up.</p><p/><p>Joining us now, Robin Sidel, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal. Robin, great to have you here.</p><p/><p>ROBIN SIDEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What is Bank of America talking about? Keep in mind, they are not saying that they're doing this. This is all behind closed doors.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Right. I mean, they have been spending the past year trying to figure out how to overhaul their checking accounts. A lot of other banks have already done so. And one of the things they're considering is giving people the choice to not have overdraft, it won't be, you could still choose between a couple of different checking accounts. But one of the accounts would not let you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So, this is great. Because at the end of the day, what these banks were typically doing is you have to opt out of what they called overdraft protection. But nobody ever saw the disclosure. Nobody ever took advantage of it. You're out with your debit card and you're shopping, and all of a sudden, you don't realize that you're charging for something you don't have in your bank account.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A lot of people have been in that situation, and 35 bucks a hit is a lot of money.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Uh-hm. And consumer advocates and lawmakers and regulators just really have slammed the industry, for disclosure, for lack of transparency, and for the high level of fees. So, they are addressing that here.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I have to, you know, full confession here, I gave Bank of America a very hard time whenever talking about introducing debit card fees. I cut off my Bank of America card on air. If they do this, I'm going to have to do something really positive because I think that is great. Why allow people to run up those fees when they do not even know that they're doing it in many cases?</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Right. I mean, some people actually, it is interesting. They're trying to start the line. Some people actually like having that protection and are willing to pay the $35 fee to buy or do whatever they want.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: But if that is the case, have them opt in, don't have me have to decide to opt out of some named program that I don't even understand. Now, you say this might be part of a bigger program to redefine checking.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What is going on there?</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Well, they have been testing for the past year in Massachusetts, Arizona, Georgia, a bunch of different pilot tests for checking accounts. And they're trying to figure out what to do. And they are also pretty sensitive to public criticism since the debit card fiasco from a couple of years ago. They are sensitive to that.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: They are nervous.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Yes, of course they are.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: They don't know what's going to happen.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Of course they are.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So, what could we see ultimately do you think?</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Well, I think you will probably see a couple of checking accounts. I think there's probably going to be a checking account geared to the low end, to people who do not carry a lot of a high balance, who don't have other relationships with the bank like a mortgage or credit card. I mean, that is kind of the way banks are going. Some banks are trying to, you know, push of those customers. They do not want them because checking accounts are actually expensive for the bank to maintain.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: How much does it cost the bank to have a checking account?</p><p/><p>SIDEL: It can cost the bank a few hundred bucks a year to maintain a checking account, and if you don't keep a lot of money in the bank and if you don't have other relationships with the bank and they're not getting any fees from you, that is the cost for them.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What do you take is the ultimate implications of what banks are doing? Because they are saying, we want those really wealthy customers that could get mortgages from us, they invest with us, they have all kinds of accounts with us. But the other people, we want to get rid of them. What would be the impact of that long-term?</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Well, I think you will going to just see different kinds of accounts for different kinds of people. Chase for example is pushing a prepaid card called liquid that they are gearing towards the lower end. There is no ability to overdraft on it either. So, they're just trying to manage their losses, but as well as still keep revenue from people who are willing to pay.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, these prepaid cards, I got to tell you, they often have big fees with them. And I have not been a fan for that very reason.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: They are changing, and the prepaid cards that are being introduced now from the banks are actually a lot lower than the ones that you used to be able to just buy at the drugstore or something. So, because -- they've got really slammed for those as well.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So, you think it's better for people to have a real relationship with the bank other than just buying some card that they can then use in any ATM? I mean, at the end of the day, don't you want to build a relationship that then leads to, you know, OK now we will going to get the mortgage, maybe we get to the bank that we have our checking account with, now we're going to get the loans for college. Maybe we will go to them too. You know, the world has changed, but I hate to think that people are so disconnected from the financial system that they have no relationship.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Well, they are. There are plenty of people who are, and there are also people who don't want to put all their eggs in one basket, who don't want to have a complete relationship with the bank. You know, there are plenty of people who don't like truck banks, don't trust them, are afraid of them.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: It's a lot of people. I have to tell you, the banks brought that on themselves in many ways with some of their policies. And of course, you know, the great recession did not do a lot to help that or the bailouts.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Right. And so, they are very aware of all that.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Robin, thanks for coming on. Very good to see you. Great story. We will continue to watch this. It's going to be interesting.</p><p/><p>SIDEL: Sure will. Thanks.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Thank you.</p><p/><p>Later in the show, how the government shutdown is actually costing the government more than if it stayed open. And next, we answer the question how you do that. We'll tell you the best way to get a good night's sleep and the real reason why it is so important. Look at Bunny sleeping. Bunny. Wake up, Bunny. We are doing the show. Come on, Bunny.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All those sleepless nights are wreaking havoc on your brain. Scientists linking sleep deprivation to Alzheimer's and dementia. Stay with us.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A warning tonight, for sleep deprived, Americans, you could be more likely to developed Alzheimer's and dementia. I know it's disturbing, right? It's a revolutionary new study, Scientists have discovered that sleep detoxes your brain from harmful chemicals. So, how do you get enough shot eye to keep your mind and your body healthy?</p><p/><p>Joining me now, Dr. Selene Parekh, orthopedic surgery professor at Duke University. Boy, that's a fancy pants title there. Dr. Selene, tell us this basic thing about sort of resetting your brain with sleep. How does that work?</p><p/><p>DR. SELENE PAREKH, DUKE LAW ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY PROFESSOR: So, this was a very interesting study from the University of Rochester, and what we know is there are two basic cells in the brain. One is called a neuron which is the cell that's active when we're awake and working and doing things that we do during the day, the other is called the Glial Cell, and the Glial Cell supports the activity of the neuron. This study showed us that when we sleep, the neurons shrink. And by shrinking, the Glial Cells are able to pump fluid through the brain --</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What fluid?</p><p/><p>PAREKH: Cerebral spinal fluid which surrounds all of our brains, the Glial Cells can pumped in through the cells, and I should clear and detox your brain while you're sleeping at night.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So what are you getting rid of when you detox?</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So, you're getting rid of toxic waste, toxic proteins, basically the garbage that the cells create through the day.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I'm taking a nap in a couple of minutes here.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>OK, what kind of disorders could this new discovery treat?</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So, interestingly, we know that disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinsons and other neurodegenerative diseases have a buildup of toxic material. So in theory, if you get sleep, you can detox the brain.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So potentially there might be a link here.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The other link you mentioned in the break that I was shocked at, you said some Alzheimer's is linked to depression. Tell us about that.</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So there are some studies showing that elderly patients are more prone to depression, and some of those patients are more prone to having neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. So we know that with depression you have sleep issues, with sleep issues potentially there's a link here with Alzheimer's.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, I'm listening to every word you're saying because my grandmother had Alzheimer's when she died, and I know it's in just about everybody's family. So, tell us how to get a good night sleep.</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So the basic ways to get a good night sleep, number one, have a regular schedule so that you're sleeping normally, roughly at the same time every night, sleep in a temp rate type of room so not too hot, not too cold. Stay away from stimulant type of drinks and activities that are really going to get you hyper.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You don't take your iPad to bed with you, do you?</p><p/><p>PAREKH: Try not to, and really limit your bedroom for sleep related activities. So, you don't want to take your iPad, you don't want to sit there and eat and do other things in the bedroom.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So, doctor, what about the length of time? Is it eight hours only or can you get away with six? Five? What do you say?</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So, I think the research is still out, we all do recommend about eight hours of sleep, but some people get away with six, some people more. This study suggests that potentially sleeping more may be more beneficial for you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So if I get up in the middle of the night and I'm wondering around the house because I can't sleep, what do can you recommend to people who have that problem of insomnia and want to get back to sleep and can't?</p><p/><p>PAREKH: So, a couple of things, try some relaxation techniques whether it's relaxation music, relaxation scents, even yoga can actually help to relax your nerves and try to get you to sleep a little better.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. So far I have a nap on the list, I have yoga on the list. You've got a long list of things that a lack of sleep exacerbates including obesity, diabetes. How is this so important -- mood disorders, reproductive problems, the list goes on and on.</p><p/><p>It does go on and on. So we know that during sleep your body repairs itself. So the bones, the tendons, the ligaments, the organs, your immune system, all of this repairs itself. I think this study is the tip of the iceberg trying to understand how sleep really affects our whole body.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Wow. Interesting stuff. Thanks for coming on and telling us about it.</p><p/><p>PAREKH: Thanks.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I am going to take a long nap. So, all right, coming up, it's like a scene from a movie. Two murders walk out of prison in Florida, thanks to forged documents. Now the manhunt is on, we'll explain.</p><p/><p>And next, the 16-day shutdown left thousands of workers furloughed, stuck at home with what they thought was no pay, but now they're not only getting back pay, they're double dipping. Our legal panel weighs in next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A double paid vacation paid for you, by you, that it, the taxpayer. In case you needed another reason to be mad at the government, some federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown also got unemployment benefits despite receiving back pay. Hmm, is this legal? Do we have cause? Can we bring an action against the government? Joining me now, Bill Frumkin, attorney at Frumkin &amp; Hunter. And Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl. All right, Lis, should these people get this money?</p><p/><p>LIS WIEHL, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: No! Wait a second! OK, you get to go on vacation, you didn't want that vacation, I understand it. You should get the back pay, I understand that, from the feds, because you're a federal employee. But by the time you get this back pay you've already gone to the state, you've got unemployment, you have to give that back to the state. Because who else was paying for it, it was taxpayers, we're all paying for that's not right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And, Bill, you have an argument against it?</p><p/><p>BILL FRUMKIN, FRUMKIN &amp; HUNTER ATTORNEY: Of course. Of course, I do. Let's pretend the two of you are working for a government-sponsored station, and they say to you ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Analyze ...</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: You know what? We want you to now, you know, take unemployment, you are not going to be able to work, you have - bills aren't furloughed, you still have to pay your car, your rent, your mortgage, you this or your that, you don't know if you're going to get paid in the end, and you know what? We're going to pay you a month from now when your claim is ready to go. The point is that it's like a night differential, it's like overtime, working on the weekend, on a holiday. It's a problem, and a lot of people who weren't essential still worked even though they weren't getting paid just to keep things going.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: But wait a second. OK. All right. So, let's take your premise as Gerri and I are working at this government-subsidized ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: We must be at NPR.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: At NPR.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I'm Elmo. You're ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: I don't know - we're at NPR, considered, buy anyway, OK, so I take your premise at that point. You're right, people have to pay their bills, and what really upset me about the shutdown, one of the things was, it's always, you know, it's the secretaries and it's the people ...</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Yes.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Not the high roll ...</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: That's correct.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: I got that. But when they do get that shut back from - which says, here is your money that you would have received, so you could have paid, you know, all those bills could have been paid. Then, you can't double dip. Then you say, OK, those bills that you've got to give it back to the ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Bill, you know, like, this makes a lot of sense. So now we're paying them twice ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And you do realize, there's a one percent pay increase in that bill. They're going to get a pay increase on top of everything else.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: OK, well, listen, this is true. But not everybody lives with, you know, a large bank account. People live check to check.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: There's a lot of stress.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: True.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: There's a lot of issues.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: But they're already getting the checks from the Fed, that's the point.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Yes, but the point is during that period of time, this uncertainty of which is quite uncertain and could happen again very quickly, they're living without not knowing whether they are going to be able to pay their bills.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: But once that federal check -- that's what I'm saying, once that federal check comes in, which the feds have promised, right? Then the state should say, and by the way, most states -- Oregon is very unusual in this way -- that you must pay it back.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Let me tell you.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: I don't disagree that it's unusual, but there is some method to the madness. How are those people going to pay their bills?</p><p/><p>WIEHL: They've already paid them.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Not cash. They don't have more cash.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right, hang on a second here, because there's an important number I want to get across to our viewers here. This is 43 million, that is the pay for furloughed workers. 77,000 of them receiving $43 million. So I still, I'm still mystified. So I get the unemployment money, right? And let me tell you, the government was out there telling people how to go about doing this. It wasn't like you had to figure it out on your own.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: And that's OK.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Then we're trying to help you.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: But now I get another check. I get a paid vacation. I get a paid - How is that fair?</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Double paid vacation.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: But it's not a paid vacation where you're going to the Bahamas and knowing that you're going to have a job when you come back, that you're going to be paid. It's somewhat like pain and suffering type money. Now, listen, I understand ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Wait a second. Wait a second.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Oh!</p><p/><p>WIEHL: You're putting on punitive damages here?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: No. That's punitive damages, this is pain and suffering. But the point I'm making, this is really ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: You already have pain and suffering, don't worry about this ...</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: It's only Oregon that -- it's only Oregon that decided to do in this.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: By the way, it's Oregon. You never say Oregon.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Well, you are not from Flushing. So I can't tell you.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Washington State.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: But the point I want to make here is that there should be uniformity amongst all the states on this and there also should be ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Uniformly they should pay the money back.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: But there should be, I say, different - separate rules for people who are furloughed federal workers as opposed to private workers and state workers who apply for unemployment.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: That's another - you just made my point again, thank you.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: OK. How did I do that?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WIEHL: That - because it puts federal employees at a higher level than private employees or state employees. It puts them at a better - it put them at an advantage that private employees and state employees don't have. And by the way, we're talking numbers? For Oregon, just Oregon itself, $650,000 it's costing.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Yeah. But is this ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: That's a lot of money for a small state.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Is this - are you at an advantage, if there's a political fight that leaves you on the sidelines not knowing when you're going to be able to pay your bills...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: But once you've got ...</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: That - I don't see ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Wait, wait, wait, they knew this was coming. This had been a fight for two years. Two years ongoing.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What you do is you set aside a penny or a shekel every week to prepare.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Well, that - in a perfect world, you're absolutely right. But it is ...</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: I don't disagree, but ...</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Or using the state money, because you don't know. You have that uncertainty.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right. I'm not against it.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: You take that state money. But once you do have the certainty of the fed money coming in ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You give that back.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Give it back.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: But you know what? There's an assumption there that people are making enough money to save money, and unfortunately even if they work for the government, that's not necessarily the case.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, look, I have nothing, I have no issue with taking unemployment if you're unemployed.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's fine by me. But don't double dip, you know why? Because it's not coming out of the pocket of Dow chemical, it's not coming out of the pocket of Exxon, it's not coming out of the pocket of some big tech company. It's coming out of my pocket!</p><p/><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: But remember, it's not like you're sitting on easy street while that's happening. It's just - you just ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: No, and I'm not sitting on easy street either.</p><p/><p>WIEHL: (inaudible) sitting on easy street but the point is once you've gotten the money back, once you've been repaid for the time you didn't work, now you're back at your job, you give the money that the state gave you. That's just - this is fair ...</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Well, I do understand that ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I don't know how we're going to resolve this, guys.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: I don't know that ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Last word, though.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Listen, I gave you extra ...</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: I understand exactly what you say, it's a very difficult issue, but it's also not good to be people squeezed in a political fight. And that's ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Amen.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: ... squeezed in this political fight. And let me tell you, I couldn't agree with that more. That's the best thing you've said through the whole segment.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: OK. Well, I had to say something that was good.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That was good. You're always good, Bill.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Oh, thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Thank you, Lis. Great job.</p><p/><p>FRUMKIN: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Tweet us, @gerriwillisfbn.

We'll tell you all about it. And next, the manhunt is on for two convicted killers who escaped from a Florida prison using forged court documents. What is going on in the sunshine state?</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Talk about your get out of jail free card, in Florida two prisoners sentenced to life for murder, well, they somehow forged documents releasing them from prison. So now two very dangerous criminals are out and on the loose. How can this happen? Joining us now a Florida criminal defense attorney. Regina Sambanan. Regina, I can't say your last name. Sambanan (ph)...</p><p/><p>REGINA TSOMBANAKIS, FLORIDA CRIMINAL ATTORNEY: Tsombanakis.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You're so good at that, thank you. Thanks for saving me on that one. I don't get how this happens more than once. It happens twice, not once, how could this possibly happen that they could forge these documents in prison?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Well, they can't.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: all right.</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Somebody's helping them. They don't have printers, they don't have Internet, and we're talking about two people that are not in jail for fraud, forgery or any type of crime like that, but for violent crimes, one of them not even smart enough to wear a ski mask. So, how are they doing it? They're not. Someone's got to be helping them. How do these papers go through? Someone's got to be paid to look the other way, someone's got to be paid to do this. It just doesn't make sense any other way.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right. So somebody inside, that's what you're saying, right?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: It'd have to be, in my opinion.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Somebody inside the system that is getting these signatures and helping them getting this information out which means there's probably big bribes.</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right? Big bribes?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: And there's probably more than one person, absolutely, because there's probably someone producing the documents, somebody has to look the other way to process the documents. I mean it could be more than one person. But these two inmates are not sophisticated to figure out how to produce these documents, how to print these documents, how to get these documents into the right hands to be released.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So, is it possible that there are lots and lots of people just like them who are out and shouldn't be?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: It is possible. I don't think there's an abundance of it, but it is possible. These men just walked right out of jail. I mean, these are violent criminals. And one on September 26th, red flagged. How come the other one got out on October 8th? What's going on?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: What is going on at this prison, you know? I mean people just walk out? That should have been right there.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So, apparently, apparently there was an announcement this afternoon that they think these two guys or at least one of them is still in the state, which shocks me that they haven't left. But apparently ...</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: It shouldn't shock you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Do you think they'll catch up with them?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Yeah. It shouldn't shock you, because they're in jail for a reason. Like I said, the guy didn't even wear a ski mask, OK? He's not forging documents. You know. Yes, he probably is still in the state. They probably are staying right here in this -- but the problem is there's victims. And they got to look over their shoulder - and they're worried. I mean you can't live in that kind of fear when the state's put the person away.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. Let me read the statement from the Florida Department of Corrections. Somebody's -- there's going to be a shoe to fall here - I don't know who is that going to be, but here's what they say for their part. \"The department followed our procedures and protocols to the letter, so in this instance, the department didn't do anything wrong. And your response?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: How about the department passing the buck? Of course they did something wrong. Two people left the prison. How can you sit there and say you didn't do something wrong? Where are these people? How did you not know in this? I mean, please. It's time for government to get with it, get responsible. You let these people out, there's something going on in your prison, fix it. Don't sit there and go, oh, I don't know anything. Well who would then?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: But who gets that ball rolling, Regina? I mean how does - what needs to happen next?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: From the top. From whoever's the warden, whoever's in charge of that prison.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: How about the governor?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: The Department of Corrections.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: How about the governor?</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Yeah, how about the governor? Exactly. Somebody's got to get involved. We're risking people's lives. They've killed before, they probably may kill again, and these victims don't deserve this. And we don't deserve this.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: No, I certainly agree.</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: What's the point, you know? If they can check in and out of the hotel?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well put. Regina Tsombanakis, thank you for coming on. I think I said it right that time. I appreciate your time.</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Good.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Good job.</p><p/><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Thank you. Well, still to come, Fox News meteorologist Janice Dean is here, but she's not telling us the weekend forecast. So, look at her new book. There she is right there. After the break. Freddy the Frogcaster. Well done.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What does the frog have to do with forecasting? More than you might think what Freddy the Frog wants your kids to learn. Coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right, some kids say they want to be a police officer or a firefighter when they grow up, you know, you don't usually say meteorologist when you're a little kid, but one author's hoping to change all that. Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean is here to talk about her new children's book called \"Freddy the Froggcaster.\" I love to say that, and why she feels it's so important kids learn about the weather from an early age. You've got to tell us about this book, it's so adorable.</p><p/><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I've been able to page through it and look at it, it seems like a great read for kids.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Did you learn something from it?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I learned something every single minute. Yes.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I learned about cold fronts ...</p><p/><p>DEAN: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Of thunderstorm clouds.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Yep, I think it's important because I wanted to not only give kids an introduction to weather, but also help parents discuss why things happen in the atmosphere. I think sometimes as parents if I wasn't a meteorologist, I don't know if I would know what a cold front or a warm front or a low pressure/high pressure is, and I think I explain that well enough so that kids and parents can get involved in what's happening outside, and I think that's really important. I think kids at a young age have an appreciation for weather.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Oh, sure. And it's the only thing anybody ever talks about, so if you want your children to be part of the conversation ...</p><p/><p>DEAN: Right.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: They need to understand the weather.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Absolutely. And like you mentioned, it opens up our dialogue with each other. I ride the elevator every day here at Fox, it's a nice day out here, Janice Dean, congratulations.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DEAN: Or is it going to rain on my parade tomorrow?</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DEAN: So, you know, it brings us together as a community. I think as well if we see a bad storm go through our neighborhood, it also brings us together to help one another. Weather is always going to be a big part of our lives, and I think if we can get kids at an early age to start discovering it more, in the long term it's going to be good for everyone, and it might inspire a new generation of meteorologists.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, that's what I think is so interesting. Because one of the things you're saying tomorrow, I understand, in an op-ed editorial to be published is that it's all about math and science.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Sure.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And this is a way to get kids interested in that. Tell us how numbers contribute to weather forecasting.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Well, it's all about computer models. What we input into the computer models to tell us what the forecast is going to bring, numbers, temperatures, drop in pressure, barometer. Numbers are important when it comes to forecasting, and there's a lot of math, and there's is a lot of science. And we know as we get kids into schools these days if they're going to compete on the world stage, they have to know math, science, technology and engineering. So those two, math and science, that's what meteorology is all about. So if we can get them interested at a young age and think it's fun, maybe they will in turn think that math and science is fun when they go ...</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Become an engineer, a meteorologist ...</p><p/><p>DEAN: Absolutely.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Who knows? You know, the job openings, this is numbers from 2016, 16 percent of bachelor degrees will specialize in STEM, but the number of jobs that are open, one million. So we're not producing enough kids to actually do these jobs. Anything we can do to inspire them is a positive, right?</p><p/><p>DEAN: Absolutely. Yeah, of course. And like I mentioned, when you have an appreciation for weather and you want to learn about it, you're going to learn about it in school, but it is a lot of math, it's a lot of science. I took something like -- that's called thermodynamics. It sounds scary, but it's fun when you can get all the numbers together. And they say this a lot, but weather is not an exact science. It won't be. We can't really predict that perfect forecast yet. But we'll certainly get them encouraged to really love those summits.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: One final question, why a frog? How'd you come up with a frog?</p><p/><p>DEAN: Well, the groundhog was taken.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>DEAN: Right? And when I thought about it, I've always had a love of frogs. And, you know, Gerri, the interesting thing that I just learned about recently that, you know, gave me inspiration that Freddy was the right choice was that frogs, apparently, when a storm is coming they croak louder. How perfect is that?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: They know. They know.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Plus, I can also say things like frogcaster, the Frogs News Network, you know, it's cute names like Sally Croaker and Polly Woggins. I had a lot of fun. It's a lot of great names, it's the illustration, Russ Cox did all the illustrations, beautiful job, and at the back of the book there's some educational purpose too. There's a definition, a glossary of all the terms that I use on television.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Every single day.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Yeah.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I have to tell you, it's a great book. Great reading.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: It's about at my level, now I think.</p><p/><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Thanks for Janice, thanks for coming on.</p><p/><p>DEAN: Anytime.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: great job. Appreciate it. Well, if you can't get your hands on the Freddy the Frogcaster costume, and you're still looking for some Halloween ideas, tonight's top five might help. The most popular costumes of 2013, well, so far, number five is for those who want to go trick or twerking, Miley Cyrus. He MTV performance is leading to Teddy-bear inspired teddies. Mom and dad shouldn't see that. Number four, break out the camouflage so you can look like the cast of Duck Dynasty. Think beards and bandannas, you know, red neck chic. Number three is a fox. This is from a viral video, in the same (inaudible) as Gangnam style, it's an electronic dance song by a Norwegian artist. Number two, characters from \"Breaking Bad.\" You can look like Walter White or Jesse Pinkman with a yellow hazmat suit that you can buy online for about 45 bucks apiece. And the number one most popular Halloween costume of 2013, the minions from \"Despicable Me.\" I love that. You can dress up your child as a small, yellow, cylindrical creatures for about 35 bucks. Costumes for mom and dad, a little more expensive. Other looks on the list, characters from the \"Game of Thrones\" or the classic, Batman. We'll be right back.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The problems with Obamacare just don't stop. As insurers are now reporting the system is generating massive amounts of flawed data. Do you think these glitches will be enough to force the president to delay the individual mandate? Here is what some of you are posting on my Facebook page. Sandy says this, \"I think the backlash will be so bad they will cancel it and transfer those folks in need to Medicaid. Interesting. And Maxine writes this, \"No, because it would mean failure.\" That is possible, too. We also asked this question on Geriwillis.com. 20 percent of you said yes, 80 percent said no. \"The president will not delay the mandate.\" And finally, you know, I cannot get over how bad Obamacare is. Look, I did not expect it to be successful, but I did not expect it a disaster either, and it has become just one more thing you have to figure out. The responsibility on your shoulders because the government sure is not helping you.</p><p/><p>Look, I am getting tons of tweets, Facebook post, e-mails, all great questions and all deserving answers. So, we are stepping in again with another call-in show on Monday. Join us. I have a panel of experts, people who are not Obama-paid consultants to tell you the real deal on Obamacare. Look, we get it. You are squeezed. It is you against Obamacare, you against the IRS. You against the companies that see your wallet as their bottom line. So, we'll be there again. I hope you will join us Monday at 6:00 P.M. That is it for tonight's \"WILLIS REPORT.\" Thanks for joining us. We will see you here Monday.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I'm Gerri Willis. Tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(voice-over): The list of technical problems with ObamaCare growth. No, there's trouble when even the big health insurers start to complain. Also, no more overdraft fees. The banks are being generous. They just might start refusing consumers an overdraft. And federal workers double- dipping because it was shutdown. Is that legal? We are on the case tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has been nearly three weeks since the ObamaCare exchanges opened, and the backlash is growing. You know, now is not just consumers complaining that they can't get on, they can't get logged in and enroll. It's insurers, the private sector who presumably would benefit from this law, they say the system is not working. Now, the latest problem insurance companies getting bad information from the ObamaCare exchanges themselves.</p><p>With us now United Health Group board member Gail Wilensky, she is the former Medicare director under President George H. W. Bush. John Engates, the CTO of Rackspace. And Paul Howard, the senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.</p><p>Paul, let me start with you. So, what are these insurers complaining about? What's going around for them? It seems that this should all benefit them.</p><p>PAUL HOWARD, MANHATTAN INSTITUTE: Now, the files from e-commerce (ph) are coming to them and they're saying, there is missing misinformation, there's duplicate information, there's corrupt information, such that they have to go back to the enrollees manually and say, is this information correct. If you just have a few thousand applications like we do today, that is fine. If you have millions, that is a disaster.</p><p>WILLIS: I am hearing that the system is enrolling spouses as children. I mean, it is crazy the kinds of mistakes going on. John, to you, what happened here? I'm used to being online all the time. I don't have problems like this ever.</p><p>JOHN ENGATES, RACKSPACE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER: Right. Well, this is a brand new system, it's relatively untested system. It was built over the last probably six months or so and put together, you know, from you know, sort of a rapid fire set of requirements. And I think what you are seeing is just the lack of, you know, testing and maturity of the platform that powers this website. This, you know, it's more or less like an e- commerce website.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>ENGATES: Like you said, your online all the time. And it should be that same kind of experience.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I have to tell you, mature, young, old, it ain't working.</p><p>ENGATES: That's right.</p><p>WILLIS: And it is shocking to me the degree that we're having problems, the big numbers that we heard this week, one person of people who visited this website were actually able to enroll. Gail, you have called this whole thing a complete screw up, you have been an HHS, you've seen what goes on from the inside. Tell us your view on these headlines you're reading.</p><p>GAIL WILENSKY, UNITEDHEALTH GROUP BOARD MEMBER: I think what may have been a major contributing factor are two issues. One is that a lot of changes continued from CMS, the agency that is in charge of this for HHS to go to the contractors very late. And it meant that with the client putting change specs to the people putting this together, they didn't really have much of a change -- chance to test before it went online for the real. The reason I say that is some of the large vendors who are supporting the federalist exchanged are the same vendors you are providing support to the state exchanges that are working well.</p><p>So, it makes you think there is something about what is going on in those federal exchanges, and the instructions they were getting from the government about how they do it. I read a statistic today that was just amazing to me. This is from a Kaiser News reporter, normally a source, friendly to the administration.</p><p>WILLIS: That's right.</p><p>WILENSKY: It took him 17 days and 63 attempts in order to enroll. Clearly it's got to fix that, or people are going to go beyond frustration.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow, John, I just want to get you and what Gail saying here about what happened with the exchanges, the same company, that some of the same vendors used on the status changes as the federal exchange, that's just she just said. She says, there's something about the way the Fed did this, that screwed it up. What do you say? What do think? You're an expert on this.</p><p>ENGATES: Yes. So, this is a massive integration project that crossed a number of departments probably spread out in many states and many federal agencies. And that is a big job, that's a big task. And you have to have expertise in doing that. And obviously, these government contractors do this kind of work, but maybe they did not have it experience that the scale, maybe they didn't have the time to do the legwork that they needed to do to pull together the agencies that are involved. I mean, if you imagine what is going on here, the system is looking up data in a variety of services and data bases all over the counter basically.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, that's true. It's bringing together a lot. But they had two in a half years to do it, Paul. And now we are hearing this company CGI, this is behind all of this, this is a Canadian company. It's not even an American company which I think is really funny. There are big time government contractor. The government has been better going with the same guys to develop Google or Amazon or Twitter or Facebook.</p><p>HOWARD: Right. So, the government procurement rules actually favor people have done business with the government before, have large lobby arms in Congress. Obviously, if you went with somebody like Google or Adele, you would be better off at this point. CMS also made a critical decision that it was going to be the quarterback for all the private contractors instead of contracting that decision now to somebody who was experience that kind of integration. CMS is not known of its IT healthcare expertise, so that was probably also a critical problem.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, there is a lot going on here Gail. You were involved with the Medicare prescription drug program, the roll out of that. And I remember it was originally criticized for being too complicated. That was the media's problem with it. Did it go better than ObamaCare is?</p><p>WILENSKY: It certainly did not have these kinds of problems. Every new program has some start up problems. Everyone knew October 1st was going to be a bit rocky and bumpy, as January 1st will be for sure. I do not think anyone anticipated that kind of problems that we're seeing to multiple attempts, people who go part way through, get an error message and get thrown off. This is beyond any expectations that I have heard about. The administration has until the middle of November to get all of these problems reasonably fixed or there's going to be great difficulty in having an effective January 1st.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, they're setting up a situation where people are going to break the law because they don't have a way of getting signed on legally. I think that's one of the major stories is not being reported right now, Paul. What do you say to this inability to get this thing together and now we're starting to hear some insurers might actually start their own private exchange because they cannot get anything done with the Obamacare network.</p><p>HOWARD: Right. It is a real problem for the insurers, if the only people who get through this process and get enrolled are desperate and sick. That creates a bad health risk for insurers --</p><p>WILLIS: But it's not just those people. It's everybody. Nobody can get signed on. One percent of the people, one percent of the people who went on this site could actually enroll.</p><p>HOWARD: Right. But that young healthy person might give up after the first time. A desperate sick person might go 50 or 60 times to get through. Health insurers are concerned they're going to be left holding the bag.</p><p>WILLIS: Hey, John, if you were designing a site and have the kinds of situations, reactions that this exchange is having, would you keep that job or would they replace you with somebody else?</p><p>ENGATES: We would be fired. We would be fired for sure. As a service provider you have to deliver and you've got to do these kinds of things, you know, sort of for the maximum up time and the performance of the site. And, you know, this one is not performing and I think you probably get fired.</p><p>WILLIS: I want everybody to jump in on this. But Gail, I start with you. Congressman Tim Huelskamp said this week, he said, this is so problematic, this rollout that we should delay the individual mandate for a year not only that, not only should we, but he predicted the president would. What do you make of that?</p><p>WILENSKY: Well, this issue has been raised as soon as the president of administration pushed back the employer mandate for a year. Why should we have employers getting an extra year, but insist that individuals must have insurance or pay a penalty.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>WILENSKY: I think the congressman is raising a very important point that if this problem does not get fixed quickly it is going to be very difficult to hold people accountable for not having insurance penalizing them if they don't when they have a reasonable response of saying, I tried. You've made it so difficult, I could not do it. So, I said, I think there is window may be up to a month, if it is not solved, there's going to be a lot of bipartisan pressure to start in this direction of saying, we need more time, we need more enrollment, we need more time before people are penalized. So, I would not be surprised if this happens.</p><p>WILLIS: Paul, do you think the president will back off?</p><p>HOWARD: If you'd ask me, two and a half weeks, there was no way, it's unthinkable the president would do that. But if this trend continues, and he's going to get an earful from the insurance companies, from the community backers like even the Robert Gibbs as reclined of the Washington Post have said, look, this is a failure right now. They do have to get things cleaned up very quickly. Things which were once unthinkable become thinkable.</p><p>WILLIS: John, how long would it take you to fix this thing if you were in charge?</p><p>ENGATES: I think we could do it in few weeks.</p><p>WILLIS: What's that?</p><p>ENGATES: I think we could do it in a couple of weeks.</p><p>WILLIS: Really?</p><p>ENGATES: Honestly, I think that it could be done. Yes. I mean, well, it depends on where the problem is honestly. I think that one of the things I would do immediately is start to simplify the site to make it easier for customers, our users to at least compare and understand what is going on. And then I would re-architect certain portions of the side to go faster and be more streamlined.</p><p>WILLIS: Faster, streamlined. That is what we expect out of an online site. Gail, John and Paul, thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>ENGATES: Sure.</p><p>WILLIS: Great conversation. Really interesting. So, we've got about three weeks to get this thing fixed. Thanks a bunch.</p><p>HOWARD: Thank you.</p><p>WILENSKY: Thanks.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you so much. Now we want to know what you think. Here is our question tonight. Do you think President Obama will delay the individual mandate? Log on to Gerriwillis.com, vote on the right-hand side of the screen, I will show you the results of the end of tonight's show.</p><p>And, you know what, we have gotten so much response from you about your concerns and questions about ObamaCare that we will do another call-in show this Monday. Look, we know you are squeezed. It's you against ObamaCare, you against the IRS, you against the big companies that want to loot your bank account with fees. We get it. We're here to help. So, start e-mailing and tweeting us with your ObamaCare questions. On Monday, there's going to be a toll-free number like we usually do.</p><p>You can call in during the show, ask me and a panel of experts. We get some great experts. Ask these questions directly or even just make a comment. OK, we've got more to come this hour including the latest on new study that shows sleeping may help prevent Alzheimer's.</p><p>And next, one of the biggest banks in the U.S. is trying to get the consumer on its side. We will look at a plan by Bank of America to save you money on fees.</p><p>WILLIS: Big news in banking. You may soon have to say goodbye to spending more than you have protection. Remember that? Bank of America is considering a new checking account that prohibits overdrafts but protects you from those $35 fees that can add up.</p><p>Joining us now, Robin Sidel, a reporter with the Wall Street Journal. Robin, great to have you here.</p><p>ROBIN SIDEL, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: What is Bank of America talking about? Keep in mind, they are not saying that they're doing this. This is all behind closed doors.</p><p>SIDEL: Right. I mean, they have been spending the past year trying to figure out how to overhaul their checking accounts. A lot of other banks have already done so. And one of the things they're considering is giving people the choice to not have overdraft, it won't be, you could still choose between a couple of different checking accounts. But one of the accounts would not let you.</p><p>WILLIS: So, this is great. Because at the end of the day, what these banks were typically doing is you have to opt out of what they called overdraft protection. But nobody ever saw the disclosure. Nobody ever took advantage of it. You're out with your debit card and you're shopping, and all of a sudden, you don't realize that you're charging for something you don't have in your bank account.</p><p>SIDEL: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: A lot of people have been in that situation, and 35 bucks a hit is a lot of money.</p><p>SIDEL: Uh-hm. And consumer advocates and lawmakers and regulators just really have slammed the industry, for disclosure, for lack of transparency, and for the high level of fees. So, they are addressing that here.</p><p>WILLIS: I have to, you know, full confession here, I gave Bank of America a very hard time whenever talking about introducing debit card fees. I cut off my Bank of America card on air. If they do this, I'm going to have to do something really positive because I think that is great. Why allow people to run up those fees when they do not even know that they're doing it in many cases?</p><p>SIDEL: Right. I mean, some people actually, it is interesting. They're trying to start the line. Some people actually like having that protection and are willing to pay the $35 fee to buy or do whatever they want.</p><p>WILLIS: But if that is the case, have them opt in, don't have me have to decide to opt out of some named program that I don't even understand. Now, you say this might be part of a bigger program to redefine checking.</p><p>SIDEL: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: What is going on there?</p><p>SIDEL: Well, they have been testing for the past year in Massachusetts, Arizona, Georgia, a bunch of different pilot tests for checking accounts. And they're trying to figure out what to do. And they are also pretty sensitive to public criticism since the debit card fiasco from a couple of years ago. They are sensitive to that.</p><p>WILLIS: They are nervous.</p><p>SIDEL: Yes, of course they are.</p><p>WILLIS: They don't know what's going to happen.</p><p>SIDEL: Of course they are.</p><p>WILLIS: So, what could we see ultimately do you think?</p><p>SIDEL: Well, I think you will probably see a couple of checking accounts. I think there's probably going to be a checking account geared to the low end, to people who do not carry a lot of a high balance, who don't have other relationships with the bank like a mortgage or credit card. I mean, that is kind of the way banks are going. Some banks are trying to, you know, push of those customers. They do not want them because checking accounts are actually expensive for the bank to maintain.</p><p>WILLIS: How much does it cost the bank to have a checking account?</p><p>SIDEL: It can cost the bank a few hundred bucks a year to maintain a checking account, and if you don't keep a lot of money in the bank and if you don't have other relationships with the bank and they're not getting any fees from you, that is the cost for them.</p><p>WILLIS: What do you take is the ultimate implications of what banks are doing? Because they are saying, we want those really wealthy customers that could get mortgages from us, they invest with us, they have all kinds of accounts with us. But the other people, we want to get rid of them. What would be the impact of that long-term?</p><p>SIDEL: Well, I think you will going to just see different kinds of accounts for different kinds of people. Chase for example is pushing a prepaid card called liquid that they are gearing towards the lower end. There is no ability to overdraft on it either. So, they're just trying to manage their losses, but as well as still keep revenue from people who are willing to pay.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, these prepaid cards, I got to tell you, they often have big fees with them. And I have not been a fan for that very reason.</p><p>SIDEL: They are changing, and the prepaid cards that are being introduced now from the banks are actually a lot lower than the ones that you used to be able to just buy at the drugstore or something. So, because -- they've got really slammed for those as well.</p><p>WILLIS: So, you think it's better for people to have a real relationship with the bank other than just buying some card that they can then use in any ATM? I mean, at the end of the day, don't you want to build a relationship that then leads to, you know, OK now we will going to get the mortgage, maybe we get to the bank that we have our checking account with, now we're going to get the loans for college. Maybe we will go to them too. You know, the world has changed, but I hate to think that people are so disconnected from the financial system that they have no relationship.</p><p>SIDEL: Well, they are. There are plenty of people who are, and there are also people who don't want to put all their eggs in one basket, who don't want to have a complete relationship with the bank. You know, there are plenty of people who don't like truck banks, don't trust them, are afraid of them.</p><p>WILLIS: It's a lot of people. I have to tell you, the banks brought that on themselves in many ways with some of their policies. And of course, you know, the great recession did not do a lot to help that or the bailouts.</p><p>SIDEL: Right. And so, they are very aware of all that.</p><p>WILLIS: Robin, thanks for coming on. Very good to see you. Great story. We will continue to watch this. It's going to be interesting.</p><p>SIDEL: Sure will. Thanks.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you.</p><p>Later in the show, how the government shutdown is actually costing the government more than if it stayed open. And next, we answer the question how you do that. We'll tell you the best way to get a good night's sleep and the real reason why it is so important. Look at Bunny sleeping. Bunny. Wake up, Bunny. We are doing the show. Come on, Bunny.</p><p>WILLIS: All those sleepless nights are wreaking havoc on your brain. Scientists linking sleep deprivation to Alzheimer's and dementia. Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: A warning tonight, for sleep deprived, Americans, you could be more likely to developed Alzheimer's and dementia. I know it's disturbing, right? It's a revolutionary new study, Scientists have discovered that sleep detoxes your brain from harmful chemicals. So, how do you get enough shot eye to keep your mind and your body healthy?</p><p>Joining me now, Dr. Selene Parekh, orthopedic surgery professor at Duke University. Boy, that's a fancy pants title there. Dr. Selene, tell us this basic thing about sort of resetting your brain with sleep. How does that work?</p><p>DR. SELENE PAREKH, DUKE LAW ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY PROFESSOR: So, this was a very interesting study from the University of Rochester, and what we know is there are two basic cells in the brain. One is called a neuron which is the cell that's active when we're awake and working and doing things that we do during the day, the other is called the Glial Cell, and the Glial Cell supports the activity of the neuron. This study showed us that when we sleep, the neurons shrink. And by shrinking, the Glial Cells are able to pump fluid through the brain --</p><p>WILLIS: What fluid?</p><p>PAREKH: Cerebral spinal fluid which surrounds all of our brains, the Glial Cells can pumped in through the cells, and I should clear and detox your brain while you're sleeping at night.</p><p>WILLIS: So what are you getting rid of when you detox?</p><p>PAREKH: So, you're getting rid of toxic waste, toxic proteins, basically the garbage that the cells create through the day.</p><p>WILLIS: I'm taking a nap in a couple of minutes here.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>OK, what kind of disorders could this new discovery treat?</p><p>PAREKH: So, interestingly, we know that disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinsons and other neurodegenerative diseases have a buildup of toxic material. So in theory, if you get sleep, you can detox the brain.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>PAREKH: So potentially there might be a link here.</p><p>WILLIS: The other link you mentioned in the break that I was shocked at, you said some Alzheimer's is linked to depression. Tell us about that.</p><p>PAREKH: So there are some studies showing that elderly patients are more prone to depression, and some of those patients are more prone to having neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. So we know that with depression you have sleep issues, with sleep issues potentially there's a link here with Alzheimer's.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, I'm listening to every word you're saying because my grandmother had Alzheimer's when she died, and I know it's in just about everybody's family. So, tell us how to get a good night sleep.</p><p>PAREKH: So the basic ways to get a good night sleep, number one, have a regular schedule so that you're sleeping normally, roughly at the same time every night, sleep in a temp rate type of room so not too hot, not too cold. Stay away from stimulant type of drinks and activities that are really going to get you hyper.</p><p>WILLIS: You don't take your iPad to bed with you, do you?</p><p>PAREKH: Try not to, and really limit your bedroom for sleep related activities. So, you don't want to take your iPad, you don't want to sit there and eat and do other things in the bedroom.</p><p>WILLIS: So, doctor, what about the length of time? Is it eight hours only or can you get away with six? Five? What do you say?</p><p>PAREKH: So, I think the research is still out, we all do recommend about eight hours of sleep, but some people get away with six, some people more. This study suggests that potentially sleeping more may be more beneficial for you.</p><p>WILLIS: So if I get up in the middle of the night and I'm wondering around the house because I can't sleep, what do can you recommend to people who have that problem of insomnia and want to get back to sleep and can't?</p><p>PAREKH: So, a couple of things, try some relaxation techniques whether it's relaxation music, relaxation scents, even yoga can actually help to relax your nerves and try to get you to sleep a little better.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. So far I have a nap on the list, I have yoga on the list. You've got a long list of things that a lack of sleep exacerbates including obesity, diabetes. How is this so important -- mood disorders, reproductive problems, the list goes on and on.</p><p>It does go on and on. So we know that during sleep your body repairs itself. So the bones, the tendons, the ligaments, the organs, your immune system, all of this repairs itself. I think this study is the tip of the iceberg trying to understand how sleep really affects our whole body.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow. Interesting stuff. Thanks for coming on and telling us about it.</p><p>PAREKH: Thanks.</p><p>WILLIS: I am going to take a long nap. So, all right, coming up, it's like a scene from a movie. Two murders walk out of prison in Florida, thanks to forged documents. Now the manhunt is on, we'll explain.</p><p>And next, the 16-day shutdown left thousands of workers furloughed, stuck at home with what they thought was no pay, but now they're not only getting back pay, they're double dipping. Our legal panel weighs in next.</p><p>WILLIS: A double paid vacation paid for you, by you, that it, the taxpayer. In case you needed another reason to be mad at the government, some federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown also got unemployment benefits despite receiving back pay. Hmm, is this legal? Do we have cause? Can we bring an action against the government? Joining me now, Bill Frumkin, attorney at Frumkin &amp; Hunter. And Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl. All right, Lis, should these people get this money?</p><p>LIS WIEHL, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: No! Wait a second! OK, you get to go on vacation, you didn't want that vacation, I understand it. You should get the back pay, I understand that, from the feds, because you're a federal employee. But by the time you get this back pay you've already gone to the state, you've got unemployment, you have to give that back to the state. Because who else was paying for it, it was taxpayers, we're all paying for that's not right.</p><p>WILLIS: And, Bill, you have an argument against it?</p><p>BILL FRUMKIN, FRUMKIN &amp; HUNTER ATTORNEY: Of course. Of course, I do. Let's pretend the two of you are working for a government-sponsored station, and they say to you ...</p><p>WIEHL: Analyze ...</p><p>FRUMKIN: You know what? We want you to now, you know, take unemployment, you are not going to be able to work, you have - bills aren't furloughed, you still have to pay your car, your rent, your mortgage, you this or your that, you don't know if you're going to get paid in the end, and you know what? We're going to pay you a month from now when your claim is ready to go. The point is that it's like a night differential, it's like overtime, working on the weekend, on a holiday. It's a problem, and a lot of people who weren't essential still worked even though they weren't getting paid just to keep things going.</p><p>WIEHL: But wait a second. OK. All right. So, let's take your premise as Gerri and I are working at this government-subsidized ...</p><p>WILLIS: We must be at NPR.</p><p>WIEHL: At NPR.</p><p>WILLIS: I'm Elmo. You're ...</p><p>WIEHL: I don't know - we're at NPR, considered, buy anyway, OK, so I take your premise at that point. You're right, people have to pay their bills, and what really upset me about the shutdown, one of the things was, it's always, you know, it's the secretaries and it's the people ...</p><p>FRUMKIN: Yes.</p><p>WIEHL: Not the high roll ...</p><p>FRUMKIN: That's correct.</p><p>WIEHL: I got that. But when they do get that shut back from - which says, here is your money that you would have received, so you could have paid, you know, all those bills could have been paid. Then, you can't double dip. Then you say, OK, those bills that you've got to give it back to the ...</p><p>WILLIS: Bill, you know, like, this makes a lot of sense. So now we're paying them twice ...</p><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: And you do realize, there's a one percent pay increase in that bill. They're going to get a pay increase on top of everything else.</p><p>FRUMKIN: OK, well, listen, this is true. But not everybody lives with, you know, a large bank account. People live check to check.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>FRUMKIN: There's a lot of stress.</p><p>WILLIS: True.</p><p>FRUMKIN: There's a lot of issues.</p><p>WIEHL: But they're already getting the checks from the Fed, that's the point.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Yes, but the point is during that period of time, this uncertainty of which is quite uncertain and could happen again very quickly, they're living without not knowing whether they are going to be able to pay their bills.</p><p>WIEHL: But once that federal check -- that's what I'm saying, once that federal check comes in, which the feds have promised, right? Then the state should say, and by the way, most states -- Oregon is very unusual in this way -- that you must pay it back.</p><p>WILLIS: Let me tell you.</p><p>FRUMKIN: I don't disagree that it's unusual, but there is some method to the madness. How are those people going to pay their bills?</p><p>WIEHL: They've already paid them.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Not cash. They don't have more cash.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, hang on a second here, because there's an important number I want to get across to our viewers here. This is 43 million, that is the pay for furloughed workers. 77,000 of them receiving $43 million. So I still, I'm still mystified. So I get the unemployment money, right? And let me tell you, the government was out there telling people how to go about doing this. It wasn't like you had to figure it out on your own.</p><p>WIEHL: And that's OK.</p><p>WILLIS: Then we're trying to help you.</p><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: But now I get another check. I get a paid vacation. I get a paid - How is that fair?</p><p>WIEHL: Double paid vacation.</p><p>FRUMKIN: But it's not a paid vacation where you're going to the Bahamas and knowing that you're going to have a job when you come back, that you're going to be paid. It's somewhat like pain and suffering type money. Now, listen, I understand ...</p><p>WIEHL: Wait a second. Wait a second.</p><p>WILLIS: Oh!</p><p>WIEHL: You're putting on punitive damages here?</p><p>WILLIS: No. That's punitive damages, this is pain and suffering. But the point I'm making, this is really ...</p><p>WIEHL: You already have pain and suffering, don't worry about this ...</p><p>FRUMKIN: It's only Oregon that -- it's only Oregon that decided to do in this.</p><p>WIEHL: By the way, it's Oregon. You never say Oregon.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Well, you are not from Flushing. So I can't tell you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WIEHL: Washington State.</p><p>FRUMKIN: But the point I want to make here is that there should be uniformity amongst all the states on this and there also should be ...</p><p>WILLIS: Uniformly they should pay the money back.</p><p>FRUMKIN: But there should be, I say, different - separate rules for people who are furloughed federal workers as opposed to private workers and state workers who apply for unemployment.</p><p>WIEHL: That's another - you just made my point again, thank you.</p><p>FRUMKIN: OK. How did I do that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WIEHL: That - because it puts federal employees at a higher level than private employees or state employees. It puts them at a better - it put them at an advantage that private employees and state employees don't have. And by the way, we're talking numbers? For Oregon, just Oregon itself, $650,000 it's costing.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Yeah. But is this ...</p><p>WIEHL: That's a lot of money for a small state.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Is this - are you at an advantage, if there's a political fight that leaves you on the sidelines not knowing when you're going to be able to pay your bills...</p><p>WIEHL: But once you've got ...</p><p>FRUMKIN: That - I don't see ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Wait, wait, wait, they knew this was coming. This had been a fight for two years. Two years ongoing.</p><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: What you do is you set aside a penny or a shekel every week to prepare.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Well, that - in a perfect world, you're absolutely right. But it is ...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRUMKIN: I don't disagree, but ...</p><p>WIEHL: Or using the state money, because you don't know. You have that uncertainty.</p><p>WILLIS: Right. I'm not against it.</p><p>WIEHL: You take that state money. But once you do have the certainty of the fed money coming in ...</p><p>WILLIS: You give that back.</p><p>WIEHL: Give it back.</p><p>FRUMKIN: But you know what? There's an assumption there that people are making enough money to save money, and unfortunately even if they work for the government, that's not necessarily the case.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, look, I have nothing, I have no issue with taking unemployment if you're unemployed.</p><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: That's fine by me. But don't double dip, you know why? Because it's not coming out of the pocket of Dow chemical, it's not coming out of the pocket of Exxon, it's not coming out of the pocket of some big tech company. It's coming out of my pocket!</p><p>WIEHL: Right.</p><p>FRUMKIN: But remember, it's not like you're sitting on easy street while that's happening. It's just - you just ...</p><p>WILLIS: No, and I'm not sitting on easy street either.</p><p>WIEHL: (inaudible) sitting on easy street but the point is once you've gotten the money back, once you've been repaid for the time you didn't work, now you're back at your job, you give the money that the state gave you. That's just - this is fair ...</p><p>FRUMKIN: Well, I do understand that ...</p><p>WILLIS: I don't know how we're going to resolve this, guys.</p><p>FRUMKIN: I don't know that ...</p><p>WILLIS: Last word, though.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Listen, I gave you extra ...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRUMKIN: I understand exactly what you say, it's a very difficult issue, but it's also not good to be people squeezed in a political fight. And that's ...</p><p>WILLIS: Amen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: ... squeezed in this political fight. And let me tell you, I couldn't agree with that more. That's the best thing you've said through the whole segment.</p><p>FRUMKIN: OK. Well, I had to say something that was good.</p><p>WILLIS: That was good. You're always good, Bill.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Oh, thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you, Lis. Great job.</p><p>FRUMKIN: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Tweet us, @gerriwillisfbn. We want to know what you think about that. And here comes top trending.</p><p>Time now for a look at the stories you're clicking on tonight on foxbusiness.com. The S&amp;P 500 index rising further into record territory today, thanks to strong earnings from some of the biggest U.S. companies; General Electric and Morgan Stanley, all rose after reporting higher profits than analysts expected. As did Google, which sent shares of the tech giant up past the $1,000 mark for the first time. The stock had never before surpassed $928 a share in regular trading since going public nine years ago. Google says, well, advertising prices continue to decline, a larger number of people are now clicking on ads.</p><p>And commuters in San Francisco Bay Area are fuming mad over the second transit strike in four months. The walkout began after six months of on- again/off-again talks between Bay area rapid transit and its unions. The two sides can't reach an agreement on work rule issues. And the Fox Business Network is now live on Sirius XM radio. Yeah. And available to the radio network's 25 million subscribers. You can catch FBN -- this show too -- on Sirius XM channel 113. Welcome to all of you Sirius people out there.</p><p>And those are some of the hot stories right now on foxbusiness.com. When we come back, the story of Freddie the Frogcaster. We'll tell you all about it. And next, the manhunt is on for two convicted killers who escaped from a Florida prison using forged court documents. What is going on in the sunshine state?</p><p>WILLIS: Talk about your get out of jail free card, in Florida two prisoners sentenced to life for murder, well, they somehow forged documents releasing them from prison. So now two very dangerous criminals are out and on the loose. How can this happen? Joining us now a Florida criminal defense attorney. Regina Sambanan. Regina, I can't say your last name. Sambanan (ph)...</p><p>REGINA TSOMBANAKIS, FLORIDA CRIMINAL ATTORNEY: Tsombanakis.</p><p>WILLIS: You're so good at that, thank you. Thanks for saving me on that one. I don't get how this happens more than once. It happens twice, not once, how could this possibly happen that they could forge these documents in prison?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Well, they can't.</p><p>WILLIS: all right.</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Somebody's helping them. They don't have printers, they don't have Internet, and we're talking about two people that are not in jail for fraud, forgery or any type of crime like that, but for violent crimes, one of them not even smart enough to wear a ski mask. So, how are they doing it? They're not. Someone's got to be helping them. How do these papers go through? Someone's got to be paid to look the other way, someone's got to be paid to do this. It just doesn't make sense any other way.</p><p>WILLIS: Right. So somebody inside, that's what you're saying, right?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: It'd have to be, in my opinion.</p><p>WILLIS: Somebody inside the system that is getting these signatures and helping them getting this information out which means there's probably big bribes.</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS: Right? Big bribes?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: And there's probably more than one person, absolutely, because there's probably someone producing the documents, somebody has to look the other way to process the documents. I mean it could be more than one person. But these two inmates are not sophisticated to figure out how to produce these documents, how to print these documents, how to get these documents into the right hands to be released.</p><p>WILLIS: So, is it possible that there are lots and lots of people just like them who are out and shouldn't be?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: It is possible. I don't think there's an abundance of it, but it is possible. These men just walked right out of jail. I mean, these are violent criminals. And one on September 26th, red flagged. How come the other one got out on October 8th? What's going on?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: What is going on at this prison, you know? I mean people just walk out? That should have been right there.</p><p>WILLIS: So, apparently, apparently there was an announcement this afternoon that they think these two guys or at least one of them is still in the state, which shocks me that they haven't left. But apparently ...</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: It shouldn't shock you.</p><p>WILLIS: Do you think they'll catch up with them?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Yeah. It shouldn't shock you, because they're in jail for a reason. Like I said, the guy didn't even wear a ski mask, OK? He's not forging documents. You know. Yes, he probably is still in the state. They probably are staying right here in this -- but the problem is there's victims. And they got to look over their shoulder - and they're worried. I mean you can't live in that kind of fear when the state's put the person away.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Let me read the statement from the Florida Department of Corrections. Somebody's -- there's going to be a shoe to fall here - I don't know who is that going to be, but here's what they say for their part. \"The department followed our procedures and protocols to the letter, so in this instance, the department didn't do anything wrong. And your response?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: How about the department passing the buck? Of course they did something wrong. Two people left the prison. How can you sit there and say you didn't do something wrong? Where are these people? How did you not know in this? I mean, please. It's time for government to get with it, get responsible. You let these people out, there's something going on in your prison, fix it. Don't sit there and go, oh, I don't know anything. Well who would then?</p><p>WILLIS: But who gets that ball rolling, Regina? I mean how does - what needs to happen next?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: From the top. From whoever's the warden, whoever's in charge of that prison.</p><p>WILLIS: How about the governor?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: The Department of Corrections.</p><p>WILLIS: How about the governor?</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Yeah, how about the governor? Exactly. Somebody's got to get involved. We're risking people's lives. They've killed before, they probably may kill again, and these victims don't deserve this. And we don't deserve this.</p><p>WILLIS: No, I certainly agree.</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: What's the point, you know? If they can check in and out of the hotel?</p><p>WILLIS: Well put. Regina Tsombanakis, thank you for coming on. I think I said it right that time. I appreciate your time.</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Good.</p><p>WILLIS: Good job.</p><p>TSOMBANAKIS: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you. Well, still to come, Fox News meteorologist Janice Dean is here, but she's not telling us the weekend forecast. So, look at her new book. There she is right there. After the break. Freddy the Frogcaster. Well done.</p><p>WILLIS: What does the frog have to do with forecasting? More than you might think what Freddy the Frog wants your kids to learn. Coming up.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, some kids say they want to be a police officer or a firefighter when they grow up, you know, you don't usually say meteorologist when you're a little kid, but one author's hoping to change all that. Fox News senior meteorologist Janice Dean is here to talk about her new children's book called \"Freddy the Froggcaster.\" I love to say that, and why she feels it's so important kids learn about the weather from an early age. You've got to tell us about this book, it's so adorable.</p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: I've been able to page through it and look at it, it seems like a great read for kids.</p><p>DEAN: Did you learn something from it?</p><p>WILLIS: I learned something every single minute. Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: I learned about cold fronts ...</p><p>DEAN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Of thunderstorm clouds.</p><p>DEAN: Yep, I think it's important because I wanted to not only give kids an introduction to weather, but also help parents discuss why things happen in the atmosphere. I think sometimes as parents if I wasn't a meteorologist, I don't know if I would know what a cold front or a warm front or a low pressure/high pressure is, and I think I explain that well enough so that kids and parents can get involved in what's happening outside, and I think that's really important. I think kids at a young age have an appreciation for weather.</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, sure. And it's the only thing anybody ever talks about, so if you want your children to be part of the conversation ...</p><p>DEAN: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: They need to understand the weather.</p><p>DEAN: Absolutely. And like you mentioned, it opens up our dialogue with each other. I ride the elevator every day here at Fox, it's a nice day out here, Janice Dean, congratulations.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEAN: Or is it going to rain on my parade tomorrow?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEAN: So, you know, it brings us together as a community. I think as well if we see a bad storm go through our neighborhood, it also brings us together to help one another. Weather is always going to be a big part of our lives, and I think if we can get kids at an early age to start discovering it more, in the long term it's going to be good for everyone, and it might inspire a new generation of meteorologists.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, that's what I think is so interesting. Because one of the things you're saying tomorrow, I understand, in an op-ed editorial to be published is that it's all about math and science.</p><p>DEAN: Sure.</p><p>WILLIS: And this is a way to get kids interested in that. Tell us how numbers contribute to weather forecasting.</p><p>DEAN: Well, it's all about computer models. What we input into the computer models to tell us what the forecast is going to bring, numbers, temperatures, drop in pressure, barometer. Numbers are important when it comes to forecasting, and there's a lot of math, and there's is a lot of science. And we know as we get kids into schools these days if they're going to compete on the world stage, they have to know math, science, technology and engineering. So those two, math and science, that's what meteorology is all about. So if we can get them interested at a young age and think it's fun, maybe they will in turn think that math and science is fun when they go ...</p><p>WILLIS: Become an engineer, a meteorologist ...</p><p>DEAN: Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS: Who knows? You know, the job openings, this is numbers from 2016, 16 percent of bachelor degrees will specialize in STEM, but the number of jobs that are open, one million. So we're not producing enough kids to actually do these jobs. Anything we can do to inspire them is a positive, right?</p><p>DEAN: Absolutely. Yeah, of course. And like I mentioned, when you have an appreciation for weather and you want to learn about it, you're going to learn about it in school, but it is a lot of math, it's a lot of science. I took something like -- that's called thermodynamics. It sounds scary, but it's fun when you can get all the numbers together. And they say this a lot, but weather is not an exact science. It won't be. We can't really predict that perfect forecast yet. But we'll certainly get them encouraged to really love those summits.</p><p>WILLIS: One final question, why a frog? How'd you come up with a frog?</p><p>DEAN: Well, the groundhog was taken.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEAN: Right? And when I thought about it, I've always had a love of frogs. And, you know, Gerri, the interesting thing that I just learned about recently that, you know, gave me inspiration that Freddy was the right choice was that frogs, apparently, when a storm is coming they croak louder. How perfect is that?</p><p>WILLIS: They know. They know.</p><p>DEAN: Plus, I can also say things like frogcaster, the Frogs News Network, you know, it's cute names like Sally Croaker and Polly Woggins. I had a lot of fun. It's a lot of great names, it's the illustration, Russ Cox did all the illustrations, beautiful job, and at the back of the book there's some educational purpose too. There's a definition, a glossary of all the terms that I use on television.</p><p>WILLIS: Every single day.</p><p>DEAN: Yeah.</p><p>WILLIS: I have to tell you, it's a great book. Great reading.</p><p>DEAN: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: It's about at my level, now I think.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Thanks for Janice, thanks for coming on.</p><p>DEAN: Anytime.</p><p>WILLIS: great job. Appreciate it. Well, if you can't get your hands on the Freddy the Frogcaster costume, and you're still looking for some Halloween ideas, tonight's top five might help. The most popular costumes of 2013, well, so far, number five is for those who want to go trick or twerking, Miley Cyrus. He MTV performance is leading to Teddy-bear inspired teddies. Mom and dad shouldn't see that. Number four, break out the camouflage so you can look like the cast of Duck Dynasty. Think beards and bandannas, you know, red neck chic. Number three is a fox. This is from a viral video, in the same (inaudible) as Gangnam style, it's an electronic dance song by a Norwegian artist. Number two, characters from \"Breaking Bad.\" You can look like Walter White or Jesse Pinkman with a yellow hazmat suit that you can buy online for about 45 bucks apiece. And the number one most popular Halloween costume of 2013, the minions from \"Despicable Me.\" I love that. You can dress up your child as a small, yellow, cylindrical creatures for about 35 bucks. Costumes for mom and dad, a little more expensive. Other looks on the list, characters from the \"Game of Thrones\" or the classic, Batman. We'll be right back.</p><p>WILLIS: The problems with Obamacare just don't stop. As insurers are now reporting the system is generating massive amounts of flawed data. Do you think these glitches will be enough to force the president to delay the individual mandate? Here is what some of you are posting on my Facebook page. Sandy says this, \"I think the backlash will be so bad they will cancel it and transfer those folks in need to Medicaid. Interesting. And Maxine writes this, \"No, because it would mean failure.\" That is possible, too. We also asked this question on Geriwillis.com. 20 percent of you said yes, 80 percent said no. \"The president will not delay the mandate.\" And finally, you know, I cannot get over how bad Obamacare is. Look, I did not expect it to be successful, but I did not expect it a disaster either, and it has become just one more thing you have to figure out. The responsibility on your shoulders because the government sure is not helping you.</p><p>Look, I am getting tons of tweets, Facebook post, e-mails, all great questions and all deserving answers. So, we are stepping in again with another call-in show on Monday. Join us. I have a panel of experts, people who are not Obama-paid consultants to tell you the real deal on Obamacare. Look, we get it. You are squeezed. It is you against Obamacare, you against the IRS. You against the companies that see your wallet as their bottom line. So, we'll be there again. I hope you will join us Monday at 6:00 P.M. That is it for tonight's \"WILLIS REPORT.\" Thanks for joining us. We will see you here Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLSRPT-2013101801cb222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLSRPT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59M9-JP31-JB20-G25X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>The Willis Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>October 18, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002OCP</classCode><className>UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNH (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Entertainment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health Care</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Prisons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Florida</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Overdraft Fees</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDEyMjExM0NDQUQxNEJEM0I4NDI2MzBDNDYzRUYzNkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTk5Q0VFNzU5OUQ5NDg4MkJCMzhEOUYwRTc5MjdFMUE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Overdrafts</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUY2OUUwQTFDNjcyNDc2RDk3RTdGODk1RjYzNDI2REI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzBCQzNERDgzMDdBNDEzNDkwMTE4NzYwREU1OTJCMjA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Legislation to invest in basic research and math and science education is bottled up in Congress. And while the federal stimulus bill directed billions of dollars to clean energy, health IT and broadband deployment   money long sought by the tech sector   Obama has disappointed the industry in critical areas such as tax policy and trade.</p><p>It's not that the president has abandoned his positions on key issues or doesn't appreciate technology and innovation, industry representatives say. On issues such as clean tech and broadband, he's done more in two years, some of them argue, than his predecessor, George W. Bush, did in two terms.</p><p>But there is still a palpable sense of disappointment. The recurring complaint is that the administration so far hasn't prioritized tech issues or devoted the time or energy to surmount resistance in Congress. And that resistance is certain to grow stronger after the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives, especially to any tech proposals that require more federal dollars.</p><p>\"It is such a big improvement, it's awkward to say they're not doing enough,\" said Ed Black, president and CEO of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association. \"But although they have articulated some wise, important goals when it comes to tech issues, implementation and achievement are sorely lacking.\"</p><p>Obama's tech platform as a candidate included a laundry list of items, but fundamentally he saw the federal government's role as part investor, part regulator. Strategic spending on clean energy, broadband deployment and research and development, he said, would help the U.S. compete globally and potentially yield new cutting-edge industries. On the regulation front, Obama proposed Net neutrality, the idea favored by many Silicon Valley innovators that the owners of Internet networks should not be allowed to prioritize traffic of their choosing.</p><p>Obama's proposals on taxes and trade   two other areas of major importance to Silicon Valley   were seen as somewhat less friendly to big high-tech companies. He proposed preventing multinational companies from deferring taxes on overseas profits, and he supported expanding free trade agreements only when tougher labor and environmental standards were included.</p><p>White House officials say Obama has made good headway on his proposals to make the federal government more open and transparent through the Web, and to accommodate the explosion of wireless devices with a plan to free up radio spectrum. The president is still committed to double federal spending on basic research during the next decade, one of his main tech-related campaign proposals, they say.</p><p>On other issues, such as taxes and Net neutrality, the aides say, it's too early to judge Obama.</p><p>\"The plane hasn't landed yet,\" said Aneesh Chopra, the White House's chief technology officer, a position newly created by Obama.</p><p>Large investment</p><p>Much of the progress Obama has made was through the $814 billion stimulus bill. Though that spending was temporary, it provided the biggest federal investment in alternative energy, high-speed Internet deployment and health IT in decades.</p><p>\"There is no idea in alternative energy that the recovery act did not touch,\" said Wade Randlett, a Silicon Valley clean-energy entrepreneur and Obama supporter who predicted that the spending \"would pay dividends for decades.\"</p><p>The president also receives kudos for an ambitious plan to extend broadband to all Americans, unveiled by the Federal Communications Commission earlier this year. The commission has begun to take steps on some of the recommendations, such as freeing up airwaves known as \"white spaces\" to accommodate the proliferation of wireless devices.</p><p>But little has happened in other areas. An early push for Net neutrality rules by Obama's FCC chairman, Julius Genachowski, has sputtered since a court decision challenged the commission's authority over broadband. Obama's recent trip to Asia ended without a much-anticipated trade agreement with South Korea. Trade pacts with Colombia and Panama have also stalled.</p><p>Tax antagonism</p><p>On taxes, Obama antagonized the business community, including big high-tech firms, with a proposal to increase taxes on overseas profits. Though the initiative went nowhere, Obama hasn't said the idea is off the table.</p><p>\"The administration has been very helpful on innovation funding, rhetorically helpful but ineffective on opening markets and fundamentally unhelpful on international tax policy,\" said Bruce Mehlman, a Republican lobbyist and former Commerce Department assistant secretary for technology policy.</p><p>R&amp;D tax credit expires</p><p>Others say Obama's rhetoric has outpaced his accomplishments in some areas. The president has gone out of his way to highlight the importance of science and math education, hosting science fairs at the White House and recruiting companies to advocate for the cause.</p><p>But legislation to boost the country's competitiveness with funding for basic research   during the campaign, Obama proposed doubling the National Science Foundation's budget   and for science and technology education remains bogged down in the Senate. And an R&amp;D tax credit widely used by high-tech firms expired at the end of last year, despite Obama's call to expand the credit and make it permanent.</p><p>With mounting concerns about federal debt and a new class of Republican lawmakers bent on curbing government spending, getting either item through Congress could become more challenging because of their multibillion-dollar price tags.</p><p>The R&amp;D credit \"has never lapsed for that long before, and it's just outrageous,\" said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a technology think tank. \"The administration could have done a lot more to say this is a high priority, it has to happen.\"</p><p>Philip Weiser, a senior White House adviser on technology and science issues, said the president will continue to press for spending on basic research and science and math education.</p><p>\"You're going to see this two-pronged message,\" he said. \"We have to be fiscally responsible but we also have to lay the groundwork for future prosperity.\"</p><p>Obama's tech scorecard Taxes \u00b7Promised: Tax overseas corporate profits, which are now deferred as long as the money is kept abroad. \u00b7Progress: Stalled, to the relief of big tech firms.

Up to a point, that's normal dealmaking; you try to create an impression of momentum and inevitability. But when the noisemaking is so at odds with facts on the ground, the degree of delusion starts to look embarrassing.</p><p><br/> We aren't there yet on these misnamed trade deals, but we are getting mighty close (as we've recounted at length in previous posts[1], as well as on Bill Moyers with Dean Baker, these pacts have perilous little to do with trade, they are really about enriching Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Big Pharma, financial services firms, and multinationals, while crippling the ability to impose regulations of all sorts, including wage protections). For instance, last year, after a secret negotiating session in Bali in the fall, State Department officials kept insisting to visibly incredulous members of the press that the deal would be wrapped up by year end. Based on the known opposition of some potential signatories to important provisions (for instance, Malaysia and Chile opposed restrictions on capital controls), there was no way agreement could be reached in the remaining sessions. After this chat with the press, a Wikikeaks release of a markup of an important chapter, that on intellectual property, showed how virtually all of the substantive provisions were contested by many, in some cases almost all, of the US's supposed 'partners' in this agreement. <br/> Just as the the foreign negotiators are digging in their heels over the Administration's overreaching and bullying, quite a few Congressmen fail to see why they should throw their constituents under the bus to help Obama get funding for his presidential library. This is an election year, and it was apparently not lost on members of the House that so-called Blue Dog Democrats (a neoliberal voting bloc that fell in with Obama's policies) were almost entirely turfed out by voters in 2010. <br/> Huffington Post tells us[2] that the Administration's efforts to get so-called fast track authority, which the negotiators claim is critical to getting a deal done, looks to be going pear-shaped in the House. While we've written previously about significant opposition (both Democrats and Republicans had circulated letters against the bills and gotten an impressive amount of support, but not enough to give the opponents a clear majority), it is looking as if the nays might carry the day:<br/> House Democrats balked Thursday at a bill designed to clear congressional hurdles for President <person><nameText>Barack Obama's </nameText></person>controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact. By refusing to put forward a co-sponsor for the legislation, House Democrats have significantly hampered the prospects for the bill's passage\u2026<br/> Nevertheless, Boehner said at a Thursday press conference that he cannot pass the bill without Democratic help.<br/> 'I've made clear to the president that this can't pass unless there is bipartisan support for it,' Boehner said. 'And this goes back months, and yet we've seen scant attention to this issue by the administration in terms of encouraging Democrat leaders and Democrat members to stand up and vote for it.'<br/> The Obama administration did attempt to drum up Democratic support, according to sources familiar with the effort, particularly with an aggressive effort to win over Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.). Kind is co-chair of the New Democrat Coalition, a group traditionally sympathetic to corporate interests, but he also is frequently mentioned as a potential gubernatorial or senatorial candidate in his home state of Wisconsin, where labor unions wield significant political clout. Neither Kind nor any other House Democrat agreed to co-sponsor the Fast Track bill, which was introduced by Sens. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in the Senate\u2026<br/> 'The president has failed to find someone who is willing to introduce the bill. He's got over 200 members to cultivate from, some of whom would like to have his support in the next election. But Democratic members are extremely skeptical of this,' Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) told HuffPost.<br/> So Boehner has said he can't deliver the votes himself, yet the Administration can't even get a sponsor or much (any?) shift in Democratic votes even after whipping. <br/> It probably didn't help that close readers found payoff-to-Silicon-Valley language on page 18 of the recently-abandoned Senate fast track language[3] (Glenn Greenwald was one[4]; I was alerted separately by a DC insider):<br/> C) to ensure that governments refrain from implementing trade related measures that impede digital trade in goods and services, re-strict cross-border data flows, or require local storage or processing of data;<br/> So this, for instance, this provision would prohibit the imposition of a data tax proposed by France as a way to deal with 'base erosion,' which is bureaucrat-speak for the tricks tech firms like Google, Apple, and Twitter play to avoid paying European taxes[5]. European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has voiced strong support for the idea.<br/> But the Senate language thus doesn't just help preserve the profits of major US technology players and data brokers; just as important, it allows the NSA to continue to use them as vehicles for spying. This provision would also task the Administration to use the trade deal to bar a proposed EU proposal to fine firms that violate privacy laws by giving information to the NSA and the GHCQ. From the Telegraph last October[6]:<br/>Britain will clash with France on Thursday over European Union data protection laws that will cost British businesses \u00a3360m every year as Europe tries to wrest control of the internet away from America.<br/> Following revelations of American spying, France is backing EU proposals to hit Google, or any other company, sharing information with the American intelligence services with massive fines of up to 5pc of global revenue.<br/> Thus the inclusion of this language is a strong bit of evidence (as if we needed it) supporting the idea that the ire of Silicon Valley firms over the Snowden revelations is all kabuki. If they were really against surveillance, as they piously claim to be, you'd see them lobbying against this language so they could argue that the possibility of crippling fines from the EU (or the huge costs, financially and strategically, of having to abandon that market), meant they had no choice but to refuse to help the surveillance state. This gambit is hardly unheard of; the Japanese regularly used 'gaiatsu' or foreign pressure, as the justification for doing things that would otherwise be difficult politically. So we've finally got evidence of where the big tech firms' loyalties lie, and rest assured, they are not to you.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/01/administration-peddling-increasing-blatant-misdirection-proposed-trade-deals.html\">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2014/01/administration-peddling-increasing-blatant-misdirection-proposed-trade-deals.html</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/09/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-boehner_n_4570837.html?1389309386\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/09/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-boehner_n_4570837.html?1389309386</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/TPA%20bill%20text.pdf\">http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/TPA%20bill%20text.pdf</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://utdocuments.blogspot.com.br/2014/01/from-last-fast-track-bill-for-tpp.html\">http://utdocuments.blogspot.com.br/2014/01/from-last-fast-track-bill-for-tpp.html</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/05/is-apple-risking-its-brand-overseas-with-its-tax-gimmicks.html\">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/05/is-apple-risking-its-brand-overseas-with-its-tax-gimmicks.html</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/10399840/UK-braced-for-battle-with-France-over-Google-data-tax.html\">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/10399840/UK-braced-for-battle-with-France-over-Google-data-tax.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NAKE10205713893486659311277307</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAKE-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B80-GM31-JCMN-Y4S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1295\"/><timeReceived>10:11 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Naked Capitalism</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 10, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0008PCP</classCode><className>TRADE &amp;

To level the playing field, big companies should be forced to share datasets that could help smaller businesses to innovate without affecting customers' privacy.</p><p>Mr Furman, 48, a Harvard professor, said the proposals would \"give people more control over their data, give small businesses more of a chance to enter and thrive, and create more predictability for the large digital companies\". Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said that he would respond to the report later this year with plans for \"the changes needed to ensure our digital markets are competitive and consumers get the level of choice they deserve\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147308449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-MR51-DYTY-C093-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 13, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the net neutrality battle is only starting: representatives in Congress are actively pursuing net neutrality regulation, and candidates have already indicated it's going to be a big issue for the mid-terms. Advocacy groups are stronger than ever, and the tens of millions of comments submitted to the FCC before its fateful vote show the strength of public opinion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p>Frankly, it's a bad time to be an internet service provider. Net neutrality is an incredibly complicated policy debate that would normally be kept in the shadows, something to be debated between the FCC and industry bodies. But in a new interview, Obama's original FCC chairman\u00a0Julius Genachowski, who presided over the commission from 2009 to 2013, said it didn't always have to be this way.</p><p/><p/><p/><p>Genachowski spoke to Ed Vaizey, a former UK Telecoms Minister, about how the US ended up in its current situation on the KindredCast podcast.</p><p/><p>\"We had a chance on this issue\u00a0in the US to resolve in a way that would've had a lasting\u00a0impact, that would've created ongoing certainty,\" Genachowski said. He led the first effort to reach an agreement between everyone - internet service providers, tech giants, start-ups, and consumers - on how the internet should be governed. \"We tried hard for a period of time to bring together the cable companies, the telecom companies, the wireless companies on one side, big tech, start-up tech on\u00a0the other side, actually made a ton of progress and got to a point where, and I'm skipping over a lot of the painful steps, this took many, many months, but we actually came to an agreement on a relatively simple set of rules.\"</p><p/><p>These are the rules Genachowski came up with: \"No blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization, you know, no unreasonable discrimination and the way to put the rules in place in the U.S, so-called Title I instead of Title II, that almost everyone involved in that effort could support.\"</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, that's where things took a turn for the worse. What Genachowski's referring to is the crux of the legal dispute surrounding net neutrality. The FCC derives its authority to regulate ISPs from the Communications Act of 1934. The specific powers that the FCC has depends on which section of the Act a company falls under. Title I authority allows for limited regulation, while services under Title II are classed as \"common carriers,\" the same as landline phone providers and electricity companies.</p><p/><p>This arcane piece of legalese is really what everyone's been fighting about all the time. Under Genachowski, the FCC implemented the Open Internet Order 2010, which sought to put rules about transparency, no blocking, and no unreasonable discrimination on ISPs, using the FCC's authority under Title I. That's the \"relatively simple set of rules\" that Genachowski refers to in the interview.</p><p/><p>Nearly immediately after the FCC enacted the Open Internet Order 2010, Verizon took the FCC to court and had the majority of the order vacated, as the court ruled the FCC didn't have the authority under Title I to impose the rules. \"The deal that we struck was one where there was broad agreement to put rules on the books but to do it under the light touch section of the statute and everyone from all the industries with one exception was willing to support that,\" Genachowski said. \"There was exactly one telecom company that decided not to support it, and to your point that decided to sue. It was unfortunate because if that hadn't happened there would've been rules on the books, I think they would've become part of the landscape and I don't that there would've been as energetic an attempt to repeal them.\"</p><p/><p>Genachowski's point is that if Verizon hadn't sued, the FCC wouldn't have enacted new net neutrality provisions under Title II in 2015. It's those provisions that were recently overturned by Pai, and while that might work out well in the short run, Genachowski's argument is that there wouldn't be nearly as much impetus for legislative action on net neutrality if the ISPs had just stuck with the Open Internet Order 2010.</p><p/><p>The rest of the podcast, which goes on to address net neutrality internationally and the future of government telecoms regulation, is available here and well worth the listen.</p><p/><p/><p>Related stories</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://bgr.com/2018/04/11/net-neutrality-regulation-ftc/\">Obama's FTC chairman has truly gone to the dark side</url></p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://bgr.com/2018/03/31/comcast-net-neutrality-fast-lanes/\">Yep, a Comcast lobbyist is already scheming about paid fast lanes</url></p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://bgr.com/2018/03/27/net-neutrality-congress-state-local-laws/\">Of course AT&amp;T and Verizon will 'aggressively challenge' any state net neutrality laws</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRBGR-5624590</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRBGR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3F-01P1-JC3V-61NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434845</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BGR</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26323\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 13, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But the net neutrality battle is only starting: representatives in Congress are actively pursuing net neutrality regulation, and candidates have already indicated it's going to be a big issue for the mid-terms. Advocacy groups are stronger than ever, and the tens of millions of comments submitted to the FCC before its fateful vote show the strength of public opinion. </p><p>Frankly, it's a bad time to be an internet service provider. Net neutrality is an incredibly complicated policy debate that would normally be kept in the shadows, something to be debated between the FCC and industry bodies. But in a new interview, Obama's original FCC chairmanJulius Genachowski, who presided over the commission from 2009 to 2013, said it didn't always have to be this way. Genachowski spoke to Ed Vaizey, a former UK Telecoms Minister, about how the US ended up in its current situation on the KindredCast podcast. 'We had a chance on this issuein the US to resolve in a way that would've had a lastingimpact, that would've created ongoing certainty,' Genachowski said. He led the first effort to reach an agreement between everyone \u2014 internet service providers, tech giants, start-ups, and consumers \u2014 on how the internet should be governed. 'We tried hard for a period of time to bring together the cable companies, the telecom companies, the wireless companies on one side, big tech, start-up tech onthe other side, actually made a ton of progress and got to a point where, and I'm skipping over a lot of the painful steps, this took many, many months, but we actually came to an agreement on a relatively simple set of rules.' These are the rules Genachowski came up with: 'No blocking, no throttling, no paid prioritization, you know, no unreasonable discrimination and the way to put the rules in place in the U.S, so-called Title I instead of Title II, that almost everyone involved in that effort could support.' Unfortunately, that's where things took a turn for the worse. What Genachowski's referring to is the crux of the legal dispute surrounding net neutrality. The FCC derives its authority to regulate ISPs from the Communications Act of 1934. The specific powers that the FCC has depends on which section of the Act a company falls under. Title I authority allows for limited regulation, while services under Title II are classed as 'common carriers,' the same as landline phone providers and electricity companies. This arcane piece of legalese is really what everyone's been fighting about all the time. Under Genachowski, the FCC implemented the Open Internet Order 2010, which sought to put rules about transparency, no blocking, and no unreasonable discrimination on ISPs, using the FCC's authority under Title I. That's the 'relatively simple set of rules' that Genachowski refers to in the interview. Nearly immediately after the FCC enacted the Open Internet Order 2010, Verizon took the FCC to court[2] and had the majority of the order vacated, as the court ruled the FCC didn't have the authority under Title I to impose the rules. 'The deal that we struck was one where there was broad agreement to put rules on the books but to do it under the light touch section of the statute and everyone from all the industries with one exception was willing to support that,' Genachowski said. 'There was exactly one telecom company that decided not to support it, and to your point that decided to sue. It was unfortunate because if that hadn't happened there would've been rules on the books, I think they would've become part of the landscape and I don't that there would've been as energetic an attempt to repeal them.' Genachowski's point is that if Verizon hadn't sued, the FCC wouldn't have enacted new net neutrality provisions under Title II in 2015. It's those provisions that were recently overturned by Pai, and while that might work out well in the short run, Genachowski's argument is that there wouldn't be nearly as much impetus for legislative action on net neutrality if the ISPs had just stuck with the Open Internet Order 2010. The rest of the podcast, which goes on to address net neutrality internationally and the future of government telecoms regulation, is available here[3] and well worth the listen.

Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former adviser to Barack Obama, says the UK must strengthen its competition rules to prevent damaging mergers like Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. He and a panel of experts said the UK should ensure consumers have more control over their data, enabling them to switch from dominant platforms to smaller players. UK Chancellor Philip Hammond will respond to Furman's recommendations on Wednesday. </p><p>The report comes as politicians in the UK, Europe, and the US find a greater appetite to regulate or even break up Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft abuse their dominant position to quash competition from smaller players and maintain a stranglehold on people's data. That's according to a review[1] led by Harvard economist and former adviser to Barack Obama, Jason Furman, who was commissioned by the UK government to examine digital competition along with a panel of experts. In his conclusion, Furman suggested that the UK's competition watchdog should scrutinise deals such as Facebook's acquisition of Instagram more closely, and consider the long-term effects of such mergers. \"Historically there has been little scrutiny and no blocking of an acquisition by the major digital platforms,\" according to the report.

The two firms have almost 60% of the market sewn up, according to industry figures[3]. The report calls on tech giants to give people better control over their data. That would, in practice, mean allowing users to move their data across to rival services, in the way that you can now move your phone number over to a rival mobile provider. It isn't currently all that easy to simply transfer all your photos from Facebook, for example, to another platform.That may need to be enforced by new regulation, according to Furman, who described tech firms' \"bullying tactics\" in a press release accompanying his report.[4] Furman and his panel of experts also called for a new type of authority, a \"digital markets unit,\" which would help enforce competition among digital firms. The goal, according to Furman, was to produce a \"balanced proposal\" that was less about punishing major tech firms and more about enabling smaller companies and startups to compete. UK chancellor Philip Hammond will respond to Furman's recommendations during the Spring Budget on Wednesday. The report comes amid a growing chorus of voices calling for better interoperability between major tech firms, which would give internet users direct control over their information. Europe's privacy rules, the GDPR, forced tech firms to make people's information portable, while Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the web, also wants consumers to take possession of their data[5]. Similarly, politicians both in the UK and in the US have shown a greater appetite for bringing the tech giants to heel. Sen. Elizabeth Warren put forward a plan this week to break up the tech firms[6], while the UK is on the cusp of giving itself new powers to issue massive fines against tech giants[7].NOW WATCH: Everything we know about the Samsung Galaxy S10, which could have 6 cameras[8]See Also: Here's what 25 popular websites used to look like back in the day[9]Apple now spends 18 times as much on research as it did when it launched the iPhone.

He also announced minor adjustments to cut red tape for visa holders and their families, including letting spouses of certain H-1B visa holders get work permits.<br/> 'I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed,' Obama said.<br/> The president's moves will make it easier for entrepreneurs to work in the United States and extend a program letting foreign students who graduate with advanced degrees from U.S. universities to work temporarily in the United States.<br/> But tech industry insiders said the changes, while positive, were limited.<br/> 'This holiday season, the undocumented advocacy community got the equivalent of a new car, and the business community got a wine and cheese basket,' complained one lobbyist, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br/> Instead of more temporary H-1B visas, which allow non-U.S. citizens with advanced skills and degrees in 'specialty occupations' to work in the country for up to six years, the 200,000-member U.S. chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers was hoping for measures to reduce the backlog of H-1B holders awaiting green cards.<br/> 'If this is all there is, then the president has missed a real opportunity,' said Russ Harrison, a senior legislative representative at the IEEE. 'He could have taken steps to make it easier for skilled immigrants to become Americans through the green card system, protecting foreign workers and Americans in the process.'<br/> For instance, IEEE and technology companies want spouses and children to be excluded from employment-based green-card allotments, thereby increasing availability for other foreign tech workers seeking green cards.<br/> Tech companies from Microsoft Corp to Intel have complained about being unable to find enough highly skilled employees and want Washington to increase the availability of visas for programmers, engineers and other specialized foreign professionals.<br/> 'Our focus really is on H-1B visas and trying to expand the number of talented technical professionals that can come to the U.S.,' Qualcomm CFO George Davis said ahead of Obama's announcement. 'The way the regulations are drafted today there's a lot of room for improvement.'<br/> Major changes would require Congressional action, however, and tech industry executives are worried that partisan rancor over Obama's unilateral action could set back chances for legislation.<br/> 'I don't view this as a long-term solution, and I hope it doesn't get in the way of a long-term solution,' said Dave Goldberg, chief executive of SurveyMonkey, a Palo Alto based company.<br/> The AFL-CIO said in a statement it would seek to ensure visa workers are afforded rights and protections.<br/> 'We are concerned by the President's concession to corporate demands for even greater access to temporary visas that will allow the continued suppression of wages in the tech sector,' the labor giant said.<br/>While limited, Obama's policy changes, such as letting more spouses work, will help some tech workers and their families.<br/> Gayathri Kumar, 29, moved a year ago from India to Phoenix, Arizona, where her husband works at Intel. She has a masters degree in communications and wants to work in television, but Kumar spends much of her day at home, chatting with friends over social media.<br/> 'I really want to work. I came here with a passion to work, not to sit at home,' Kumar said. 'I'm bored, I'm becoming depressed.'<br/></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JWBN13840614165648762572778330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JWBN-138406</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DN5-NHJ1-F03R-N0B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><timeReceived>10:14 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Jewish Business News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 21, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009MZ0</classCode><className>INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL &amp;

Thank you very much. We're going to start up with this Fox news alert. So we were anticipating a letter from the state department official to be handed from Kim Jong-un in North Korea to our President. It has now just happened. Our own Rich Edson of Fox News is reporting that he can confirm that part of what President Trump talked about aboard Air Force One today has happened.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Secretary of State Pompeo has received a letter from Kim Jong-un to give to President Trump. Remember, the course is still going forward after their meeting, that summit, denuclearization is the goal. And now a letter to the president from their Chairman. We'll cover the news as this happens as more details pop on this. Also, breaking right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: -- here to deliver a simple message and that is that you need to vote because our democracy depends on it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: And in this breaking news, former President Barack Obama says he's back asserting himself back into the political arena and not holding back what he really thinks about the state of our democracy and accusing President Trump by name and the GOP of fueling division and resentment in America.</p><p>Obama claims he has the answer to save us all. In primetime tonight, I'm Harris Faulkner in for Martha MacCallum. Former President Obama delivered a fiery speech today at the University of Illinois to kick off his return to the political arena ahead of the critical midterm election. And for the very first time in this manner, he called out the president by name.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: This is not normal. These are extraordinary times and they are dangerous times. I am here to tell you that even if you don't agree with me or Democrats on policy, even if you believe in more libertarian economic views, even if you are an evangelical and our position on certain social issues is a bridge too far, even if you think my assessment of immigration is mistaken, I'm here to tell you that you should still be concerned with our current course. We are Americans. We are supposed to stand up to bullies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: President Trump also on the campaign trail today and had this to say about Obama's attack.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He said, what do you think of President Obama's speech and I said, I'm sorry, I watched it but I fell asleep. I found he's very good, very good for sleeping.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: And around and around we go. Trace Gallagher always good to see. West Coast Newsroom, Fox top story. Wow.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Yes, good to see you, Harris. This appears to be kind of a preview of what we can expect former President Obama in the run-up to the midterm elections. Mr. Obama plans to cover a lot of ground starting this week in California and next week in Ohio.</p><p>The plan we're told is for the former President to go after what he believes is President Trump's Achilles Heel, for example, his relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions who President criticized again this week for investigating GOP Congressman Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins ahead of the midterms. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: It should not be Democratic or Republican. It should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the Attorney General or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Mr. Obama went on to criticize President Trump for his treatment of the media saying the free press should not be threatened because they say things we do not like. Watch again.</p><p>OBAMA: I complained plenty about Fox News. But you never heard me threaten to shut them down or call them enemies of the people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: Although the former President did indicate Fox News was an enemy of the Democrats saying that we have a \"destructive viewpoint and were responsible -- for key Democratic losses back in 2016. And Mr. Obama who has mostly stayed silent on President Trump appears to be now making up for some lost time. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: We're supposed to stand up to discrimination and we sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers. How hard can that be saying that Nazis are bad.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: A clear reference to last year's attacks in Charlottesville, Virginia. Though in fairness President Trump did condemn Nazi sympathizers though it took him 48 hours to do so. But the current President thinks the former President is just having a sour grapes moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think he was time to take some credit. He was trying to take credit for this incredible thing that's happening to our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GALLAGHER: And you will see that type of back and forth for about the next eight weeks or so. Harris?</p><p>FAULKNER: All right. We're ready. Trace Gallagher, thank you very much. Let's bring in now Deneen Borelli, a Host at CRTV.com and a Fox News Contributor and Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic Strategist and former Senior Adviser to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Great to see you both. You both are so shy. Let's jump right in. (INAUDIBLE) let's see if you're listening.</p><p>All right, so actually Antoine, I want to start with you. Barack Obama today former President had a whole lot to say reaching across, I guess, the aisle. He called evangelicals out by name. Are these the same whom he said were reaching for their religion and guns?</p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: No. Well, first of all let me say to President Obama and the other two we have in the Democratic toolbox, Michelle Obama, thank you. And to the Republicans, I think today's speech means game on. It was refreshing to hear the leader like Barack Obama talk about what we're experiencing in this day. He talked about issues, he talked about the rhetoric, but most important he talked about how do we chart a path forward. And regardless if you're Democrat or Republican, I think most people agree that our democracy is on fire and we need political firefighters.</p><p>FAULKNER: All right. Do you need so many people that the people whom you don't agree with because that's mainly who this speech was for? He called out libertarians, I mean, he did more reaching across the aisle perhaps, Deneen, than we've seen. I mean he talked with evangelicals and he didn't accuse them of anything.</p><p>DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, listen, what we're listening to from former President Obama is that first of all he is not happy with the fact that his legacy has been rebuked by President Obama. You look at the failed Iran deal, you look -- yes, let me finish, please. The fail Iran deal, look at how he had taxes -- high taxes and regulations that harmed hardworking Americans. There is a long list of things that former President Obama did that did not help Americans, hardworking Americans. And so he will be coming out like this on a regular basis criticizing the Republican Party and criticizing President Trump. But you look at the economy, Americans are happy. Excuse me.</p><p>FAULKNER: Americans are happy and not to put too fine a point on it, people who are in those categories of diversity are seeing the lowest points of unemployment of that rate at least in decades. Antjuan?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: I think the President addressed it very well in his speech that the fact that the economy is doing well is because he was the reason that started this pathway --</p><p>FAULKNER: He did say that, yes.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: -- that we see now. And he addressed it and if truth be told, if we look at pure numbers, take the emotional arguments out of it, compared to what he inherited from the Republican president before him to what he had to do to get our economy back on track, I think the proof is in the pudding. But larger than that, I think this says a lot -- his speech today spoke to the hearts and the minds of independent thinkers in this country because whether you're Democrat or Republican, black or white, California or South Carolina, most people will agree that we are starting to unravel at our core and in this country and it's a scary place as we move forward.</p><p>FAULKNER: Most people would agree were more divided than ever but it didn't -- and the President interestingly, the former President said today that it didn't begin with President Trump and he's right about that. That division has been around for a while. Let's talk about the politics of it though. We're about to see these two men go. Remember when President Trump said a couple of weeks ago, six-seven days on the campaign trail. I can't even imagine what the Secret Service was thinking in that moment. But now you've got former President Barack Obama saying that he's going to insert himself.</p><p>Deneen, how does that work out for a former President who lost more than a thousand national and state House seats?</p><p>BORELLI: Yes, that is a good question because first of all, the Democrat Party I think has a number of problems. There are big divisions because you have the activists, the liberals who want to bring in socialism. They are further to the left. And then you have the establishment Democrats who don't want to go that far to the left. So their message is split. And not only that, you have people like Maxine Waters for example who was calling for folks to get in the faces of Trump Administration personnel to go after them at the restaurants and gas stations. There are a number of issues that the Democrat Party is facing. They're not talking about policies that will help hardworking Americans.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: That's not true.</p><p>BORELLI: None of them support the tax cuts. We're seeing the benefits of the tax cuts and rollback in regulations, wages are going up, people are getting bonuses, more jobs in manufacturing, there are over 400,000 jobs since President Trump became president. So we're looking at a good economy that is clipping along and that is something that Americans are concerned about.</p><p>FAULKNER: So, Antjuan, without stepping on progress, how do you combat with a positive message if you will, about the economy that is about change? I mean, what do you think people really want to hear about change and keep it positive?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Well, let me say a few things. One, Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are the great unifiers and the great equalizer for the Democratic Party. In order for Democrats to be successful in November, it's going to take a united front of the Democratic Party. I believe those two are the two people that can bring the many facets of our party together.</p><p>And number two, your guests failed to mention the policy prescriptions that Democrats are putting forth up and down the ballot in elections all across this country and that's why we've won over 40 somewhat legislature seats where President Trump won and 2016. That's why the Connor Lamb is the of Congressman from Pennsylvania, a district that Trump won by 20 points. That's why Doug Jones is the U.S. Senator from Alabama. Because when you talk about health care, when you talk about the economy, when you talk about the environment, when you talk about simple things that make sense to the heartbeats of the American soul, Democrats are campaigning on those things.</p><p>FAULKNER: Antjuan Seawright, thank you very much. Deneen Borelli, I would leave you two with this. It's interesting, fascinating the current President getting ready to go out and help people and get the job done as presidents are often called to do. Your party Antjuan is looking back to a president who hasn't been in office. What does the future hold? We'll talk next time you're on. Thank you.</p><p>BORELLI: Thank you.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Thank you.</p><p>FAULKNER: Up next, President Trump calls on Jeff Sessions to investigate who is behind that explosive, unnamed source op-ed saying it's a matter of national security that we find out. James Fitzgerald is a former FBI linguist who helped find the Unabomber through his manifestos. He sees some clues in the writing way -- wave to us if you can because you're up next. Hey!</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: For the sake of our national security, the New York Times should publish his name at once.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: President Trump is now calling on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to track down that unnamed senior official behind that scathing New York Times editorial saying whoever pinned that piece poses a threat to national security. Kevin Corke is tracking that from Sioux Falls, South Dakota tonight where the President wrapped up a speech just a few minutes ago. Kevin, good to see you.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Harris, great to be with you. The President having a very busy travel day with stops in the Dakotas including right here where he took part in a fundraiser for GOP Gubernatorial hopeful Kristi Noem. But questions still abound, Harris, about the now-infamous New York Times op-ed. You know, the one allegedly pinned by an anonymous administration official who claims to be working to subvert the President's policy goals.</p><p>The larger argument percolating now, Harris, is this, whether or not that administration official who has admitted attempting to impede the function of government and its policy aims is, in fact, a national security threat. It is clear the President thinks so and today aboard Air Force One he said he wants that person found.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Supposing I have a high-level national security meeting, and he has got a clearance, you know, we talked about clearances a lot recently, and he goes into a high-level meeting concerning China, or Russia, or North Korea, or something, and this guy goes in. I don't want him in those meetings.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE: The President, Harris, has proposed having the Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the DOJ locate the person who wrote that piece. But as you can well imagine, the New York Times has a manifestly different viewpoint on that topic. Let me share part of a statement from Eileen Murphy of The Times, it reads thusly, \"We're confident that the Department of Justice understands that the First Amendment protects all American citizens and that it would not participate in such a blatant abuse of government power.\"</p><p>Now it is also important to point out that there is no criminal behavior necessarily and having penned that op-ed even for The Times anonymously thus making it unlikely the DOJ would pursue that person Harris criminally. However, the feds also might have a vested interest in locating that person if she or he is in the military or has any part of a national security portfolio. This story continues to unfold but for now back to you.</p><p>FAULKNER: Well, and specifically today Mercedes Schlapp with Communications Department of the White House mentioned security clearances and I mean there are some other things that the president would want to take a look at to see if anyone was complicit in this and if there might be some retribution to be handed out. Kevin Corke, thank you very much. Great to see you.</p><p>Let's bring in my next guest now and go a little bit deeper on this, an expert he is when it comes to deciphering writing. James Fitzgerald is a former FBI linguist who poured through Ted Kaczynski's manifestos -- boy we haven't said that name in a while -- and he was able to actually help eventually identify him as the Unabomber. He is the author of the memoir series a journey to the center of the mind. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for being with us, James Fitzgerald.</p><p>Let's start with what you say should be a commonality in something and identifying someone and that is that they use the lingo that only people in the room or the circle would know about. Did you find that in this op-ed?</p><p>JAMES FITZGERALD, FORMER FBI AGENT: Well, I certainly did, Harris. And there's no question this person has an advanced level of writing skills and he or she -- not sure exactly gender at this point -- but they know how to write very succinctly, very cogently recode gently and get their points across. There's 27 paragraphs here, 14 of them are only one sentence which is kind of unusual for people's writing style. Paragraphs are generally supposed to be more than one sentence. However, some journalists do tend to write in only one sentence.</p><p>So there are some and I'm certainly aware that this may have been -- there's been a copy editor involved in this to some degree at the New York Times maybe even several levels of that. So there may have been some editing here but there's definitely some language familiar to this person and certainly from someone who may be involved in the White House staff.</p><p>FAULKNER: So I made a similar observation although it's different experience that's driving it. You're looking at it forensically and I'm looking at it from the eyes of a journalist. Almost everything has some copy editing unless it's breaking news just to make sure that it -- the verbs are succinct and those sentences are easy to digest and remember which is why they tend to be very short.</p><p>Let's talk about the perspective that you found from this writing. You say that there's no singular point that says, oh it's got to be this person because that's their expertise. You say you could almost get what's in this op-ed from reading about other stuff.</p><p>FITZGERALD: Sure. And what I -- I've handled dozens of these cases even in retirement in the last ten years from the FBI as a forensic linguist and there's a Web site called glassdoor.com. A lot of people go in that and complain about their jobs, their companies, their CEOs and I've been hired by some CEOs to try to find out who may have written these things. I don't judge whether it's right or wrong, whatever they asked me to try to find authorship and determine it, I do. And this letter, these 27 paragraphs could almost be sort of an elongated version of a Glassdoor posting complaining about a boss, about a company who does things wrong, so that's not all that unusual in terms of my experience.</p><p>But what I've noticed most importantly in those other types of communications, they're what I call is a linguistic proof of life. You know, anybody familiar with you know, kidnapping cases. There's generally a picture of the victim holding up a newspaper or something that can be dated. And as you said earlier, Harris, there's really -- and that would be something that would prove the kidnap victim is still alive so of course pay the ransom etcetera. But here in this -- in this document, in all 27 paragraphs, there's not one thing that's singular as far as I know that hasn't been already mentioned in the media, in someone's book or various pundits commenting on. So to me, that ownership takes away from that.</p><p>FAULKNER: Yes, it's what you're saying. It's like a calling card we all watched enough of those CSI types shows where they're leaving their calling card is what you're saying. I want to turn to a couple of things that you pointed out to my team. You said that -- you looked at some things. Let's put these words up on the -- on the screen if we can. That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can. You say that that's an important point to look at. Why is that, James?</p><p>FITZGERALD: Well, first of all, anonymous authors have two goals in mind. One, to get their point across and two, to remain anonymous. And it's about a 50/50 percentage roughly of how important they take each issue. So here in a letter that supposed to be anonymous, we have here an interesting autobiographical clue and that is -- that is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can. So this person is including himself or herself in this group of Trump appointees.</p><p>I would consider that and this is a linguistic term that I coined, a contra-indicator. That means it's against indications. It's against what's truthful. So it's very possible that this person is lumping -- they're lumping themselves in with a Trump appointee group but in reality, they may be not, that they may not be that. They may be a lower-level someone who just took a regular job and somehow now they're involved in the White House staff and some decision-making and all of a sudden they're trying to lump themselves in with this to try to make themselves appear more important but also not identified.</p><p>FAULKNER: Well, you know, what's interesting about what you say lower- level and that's the idea that if the New York Times sort of suggesting -- more than suggesting that this was a higher level official, puts them on a different playing field in terms of their sourcing for this, but if it is, in fact, a lower-level person, the criticism has been well, is that been closer to gossip than expertise. It's an interesting question and you pointed out here from a perspective. James Fitzgerald, thank you very much. Great to have you on the program tonight.</p><p>FITZGERALD: You're welcome, Harris.</p><p>FAULKNER: It was the moment of defiance that turned out to be well not so defiant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D), NEW JERSEY: This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: And in fact cue the meme, Senator Spartacus now Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says there could be some real repercussions for Cory Booker stunt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOKER: I'm going to release the e-mail about racial profiling and I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. This is about the closest I'll probably had in my life to an I am Spartacus moment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: Senator Cory Booker standing by his decision to be Spartacus and release confidential documents to the public. It has now been revealed that a lot of those documents actually were already public from a deal that he'd made the night before was Senator Mike Lee but I digress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says consequences could be coming Mr. Booker.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: When you break the Senate rules, it's something I think the Ethics Committee could take a look at. And that would be up to them to decide. They have an obligation to look into violations of the Senate rules and it wouldn't surprise me if they did.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: Well, after hours of trying to reach him yesterday, Fox News caught up with Senator Booker today who had this message for Mitch McConnell. Watch it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOOKER: If he wants to write me up on ethics charges, I have two words, bring it. Bring it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: Here now are Tammy Bruce ready to bring it, Washington Times Columnist, Radio Talk-Show Host and a Fox News Contributor, Emily Tisch Sussman Democratic Strategist and Senior Adviser for Glam Up the Midterms. Well, that is great, right on time, 60 days away or so. Let's start with the initial grandstanding that Senator Booker did. It sure did Emily in that moment yesterday, looked like he was ready to capitulate to whatever rules were coming that he was breaking in punishment and so on and so forth. I'm going to save the people by showing some documents about Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>EMILY TISCH SUSSMAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So he had actually already violated Senate Rules verbally the day before by releasing the documents and speaking about what the content of them was. So when they had that exchange in the Senate, he was actually quite surprised by the fact that it became -- that Cornyn was coming at him so aggressively talking about impeachment and that is really where that emotion came from.</p><p>Booker is was coming into the Senate and saying, look, we need to understand where Kavanaugh stands, where he comes from. This is a lifetime appointment. This is not about this political moment. This is really about understanding where so many of these rulings that affect the American people. What his perspective is on it. We only have less than ten percent of his documents released. We need to see more to understand.</p><p>FAULKNER: So can you walk across all the sharks that he jumped? That's what I want to know. Because he knows he had talked with Senator Lee.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Sure.</p><p>FAULKNER: Prior--</p><p>BRUCE: He knew.</p><p>FAULKNER: Prior to any of the histrionics that happened.</p><p>BRUCE: He knew.</p><p>FAULKNER: And those documents really were ready for public--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. They weren't confidential. They everywhere approved for release. He knew that situation. But what's interesting is and it's funny it took so long to find them considering Spartacus usually was found by everyone, suddenly he is not so in front of everyone.</p><p>But this is, the irony here is that he clearly was performing for part of the base saying I'm your champion. Now also normally you don't call yourself Spartacus or an iconic class. Other people are supposed to call you that, right?</p><p>FAULKNER: But others, yes.</p><p>BRUCE: But there he was performing and same things actually also that we learned were not true and misrepresenting the environment. And that's why for both parties there are individuals now, you see people winning, you see the approval rating of Congress so low because they are tired of the fraud of what they've been seeing.</p><p>A lot of talk, no real delivery being misrepresented being lied to in some instances and so this effort I think appeal to the far left part of the base was actually more of what all of us do not like and this, I think is, a lesson for all of us.</p><p>It certainly I think it back fired. I don't think his base is going to like it because it really, we missed an opportunity to really do ask serious questions in the charade and the circus that the Democrats created.</p><p>FAULKNER: Well, what was interesting, too, is that Senator Hirono from Hawaii had a completely different issue and had actually come forth more earnestly with releasing these documents and wanting people to focus on the Native American constitutionality issues that she was having with Kavanaugh.</p><p>BRUCE: Sure.</p><p>FAULKNER: And she was jumping in the boat. Yes. I'll go down in flames just to bring this all alive, too. And bring it to the public. And it was a missed opportunity for Booker to get on with something that actually was confidential.</p><p>SUSSMAN: Well, she is releasing documents. And he actually continues to release documents. I would actually like to clarify one piece on the time line that is the conversation when the Senate decided to make the documents public. It was after he had already spoken about the content of them.</p><p>So, them actually deciding to the fact that they were no longer confidential was actually not so relevant because he had already spoken about them. But I do actually take issue with the fact to say that this was all grandstanding and this is what people are--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: So what was it? Senator Thune called me that now we now he' running for president.</p><p>SUSSMAN: What is the deal?</p><p>FAULKNER: Senator Thune said that's what Booker's actions told us he is definitely running for -- which part do you mean are regal?</p><p>SUSSMAN: I think what if -- what if it's real that he feels that people should understand what is it in Kavanaugh's past? What if all of that was real? What if he really does believe it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: I think a lot of people are talking that.</p><p>SUSSMAN: I actually think (Inaudible) the fact that he was running--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: Just a minute.</p><p>SUSSMAN: You know what? I didn't interrupt you. I actually think the fact that he was saying that he was running for president is the easiest way to write it off. I think that people are nervous that they see--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRUCE: But it was all -- you notice what the coverage was and the reason we have a problem with that and that's not accurate, is that this was about his Spartacus moment. What I am doing. What's going to happen to me? Where I'm putting myself at risk?</p><p>It was the Cory Booker show. It was not about Judge Kavanaugh. And if he was serious he would have stood up against the circus that was happening with people that had been invited by the Democrats into that room. It clearly had nothing to do with Judge Kavanaugh, especially since all of them, virtually all the Democrats had said already that they're not going to confirm him.</p><p>FAULKNER: So, Emily, what I appreciate totally about what you are saying and you are looking for that sincerity and you are looking for that nugget of what if this person really does care about the people.</p><p>I mean, I totally get that. The timing and the time line I think are something that people disagree about. But one thing is for sure. He says he is still releasing documents. So what do they do now?</p><p>SUSSMAN: Yes.</p><p>FAULKNER: Mitch McConnell may go after him.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, the ethics committee is the place where people go and you never hear about them again. This is why al -- remember Al Franken and they said well it should go to the ethics committee and everybody said no because then everything will just continue.</p><p>The ethics committee is famous just to add actually cover for people. This is in institution which still has the secret sexual harassment list paying taxpayer dollars on those cases so they don't release that. Nothing will happen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: I've had women on Capitol tell me -- Capitol Hill telling me about that shush fund.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes.</p><p>FAULKNER: And how nobody wanted to come to the meetings to try to get rid of it.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes. Nothing will happen to Senator Booker and he knows it. So to talk--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SUSSMAN: We invite him to talk about it.</p><p>FAULKNER: I would love that. That story is still out there.</p><p>OK. A new movie shining a new light on the dancers of big tech. Do Google and Facebook have the power to influence the way you think and even the way you vote? Peter Schweizer, who took on the Clintons is here to preview his brand new movie next. Ladies, thank you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They can suppress certain types of results based on what they think you should see thing, based on what some of the followers think (Ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's what Google and Facebook are doing on a regular basis.</p><p>FAULKNER: You may know the name Peter Schweizer exposed corruption by the Clintons in his bombshell book \"Clinton Cash\" and he is back at it with a brand new target big tech companies. In his new movie quote, \"The Creepy Line,\" Schweizer explores how companies like Facebook and Google track our data and influence our views. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It will always favor one online music service over another and one candidate over another. Google and Facebook has the power to undermine democracy without us knowing that democracy has been undermined.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's what I call the creepy line and the policy about a lot of these things is to get right up to the creepy line but not cross it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: Peter Schweizer joins me now. \"The Creepy Line.\" OK. They have things like face recognition and all this personal data. Are they crossing the line?</p><p>PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR, \"CLINTON CASH\": Absolutely. Google crosses that line every day. And what's important for people to realize is it's not just an issue of privacy them collecting this information on you.</p><p>They are actually using this information against you. Not just to, you know, try to sell your products but to try to manipulate your views and your attitudes on political issues and other things. There is academic evidence for this overwhelming and there are just simply no question. I think the question is what are we going to do about it?</p><p>FAULKNER: Yes. And will they loosen their grip to let us do what we need to do about it is also the question. Because I can't imagine they do this and it makes no money.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well, that's right. There a monetary component. But, look, the other thing that Google has done from the beginning is define itself as a different type of company.</p><p>In other words, they are not just bottom line oriented they have a mission and purpose and it's kind of quasi-Utopian in a way which leads them to embrace certain political views.</p><p>And they are quite open in manipulating their algorithm and carrying out other activities and their design advance those political interests. And guess what, it has results.</p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that their manipulations and their search manipulation do dramatical influence particularly swing voters. Voters that don't have fully defined views they have a very real impact on the political decisions that those people are making.</p><p>FAULKNER: So if they try to fill up the public space with the stuff they think we ought to like and ought to know and cross that creepy line is the answer then for the government to step in any way?</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Well, look, here's the interesting thing, Google and Facebook are essentially unregulated because of something called the Communications Decency Act of 1996. And section 320 of that law basically says these companies are, quote, unquote, \"neutral platforms.\" They don't edits, they don't exert editorial control--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: But they are not neutral platforms.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: That's exactly right. And that's the point. The point is that's what they claim they are. That's how they are regulated. They are not. They are basically media companies, Fox, NBC, you name it are regulated far differently than Google and Facebook.</p><p>So, my point is we don't need new laws, we simply need to call Google and Facebook what they are which is media companies and they need to be regulated accordingly.</p><p>FAULKNER: And as people hear that they say, well, you know, that sounds like extra government, yes, I would imagine that's why they keep calling them to Capitol Hill. One last quick word.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Yes. It's not extra government. It's calling them what they're. If I start a paper route and I start publishing a newspaper, I can't say I only run a paper route regulate me that way.</p><p>FAULKNER: Good example. Peter Schweizer, we want to have you back. Thank you.</p><p>SCHWEIZER: Thank you.</p><p>FAULKNER: Big issue. We'll continue to follow it. When we come back, a weather alert for the entire East Coast. Tropical storm Florence is coming.</p><p>FAULKNER: And this is coming together and breaking tonight, a Fox News alert. North Carolina's governor just issued a state of emergency. And it comes ahead of Florence.</p><p>The tropical storm is brewing in the Atlantic expected to become a major hurricane and affect the entire the East Coast in the next few days, really the first big one we have been talking about so far on this coast.</p><p>Chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth joins me now.</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST: It's been a really calm season, kind of.</p><p>FAULKNER: On this coast.</p><p>REICHMUTH: We have big impacts. We have Gordon last week a tropical storm across the Central Gulf but this could be our first really big storm. We've been talking about it for a few days and not knowing if it's going to get to the U.S. or not but it's looking a little bit more likely.</p><p>Take a look at some of the weather map. I'll show you a couple of things. First of all, we are climatologically right -- that's a big word climatologically right at the peak of hurricane season. September is a peak, September 10th and so we're right in that mode right now.</p><p>And long with that, look at all these storms in the Pacific and the Atlantic, we have six storms we're watching out there. The three in the Atlantic are the ones now that potentially have some sort of impact for us, certainly Florence and also we are talking about that tropical depression number nine we are going to watch.</p><p>This is a look at the path. Harris, it's really interesting, no storm that's ever been where this storm is now has ever hit anywhere around the U.S. And this one models are coming into better and better agreement that we are going to have some sort of impact from this.</p><p>We have been seeing our models all show this moving up towards the north, maybe around Bermuda. Take a look at the latest track, it has moved much more to the south and heading straight towards the U.S.</p><p>Will it curve out? It's possible that it will make a little curve before it hits here. We don't know. But these models that look we call them the spaghetti models they look really messy. They look much more in agreement than they did before.</p><p>FAULKNER: Yes, they are clustered.</p><p>REICHMUTH: They're much more clustered. So that's giving us more confidence it's going over plenty warm water. And at this point we expect it to become a major hurricane. We would be talking about impacts being felt sometime on Wednesday morning if this happens right along the Carolina coast line.</p><p>FAULKNER: OK.</p><p>REICHMUTH: It means -- I would -- I just tweeted out something you want to look at my Twitter Rick Reichmuth, you can get some information on where to go now--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: I will read your--</p><p>REICHMUTH: -- to read information and then to start making your plans. This is the weekend to make those plans.</p><p>FAULKNER: You know, some people get their information on social media now.</p><p>REICHMUTH: Yes.</p><p>FAULKNER: So they are moving around and trying to adhere to those evacuation zones.</p><p>REICHMUTH: Great.</p><p>FAULKNER: It's great to get that information out on so everybody remember to take battery packs that are charged already as well as many as you can because as you get ready for the storm Florence.</p><p>REICHMUTH: Yes.</p><p>FAULKNER: Thank you very much. I know we'll see you over the weekend a lot.</p><p>REICHMUTH: Let's go here over a lot.</p><p>FAULKNER: Updating us. Coming up, remember when Michael Moore said this?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER: The only way that we're going to stop this is eventually we are all going to have to put our bodies on the line.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: Now the controversial filmmaker is comparing the president to a brutal dictator. My ladies night panel, they call it that here, up next. Plus, do you see that bizarre Elon Musk interview? Did you see it? I think he is smoking the weed.</p><p>FAULKNER: Michael Moore is at it again. The liberal filmmaker is out with a new anti-Trump documentary that's reportedly so extreme it compares our president to Adolf Hitler. Here's a preview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How the (muted) did this happen?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The American dream is dead.</p><p>Stop resisting.</p><p>(CROWD CHANTING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president's powers here are beyond crushing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, the last president of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: Here now for ladies night Shelby Holliday, Madison Gesiotto, and Elizabeth Wagmeister. Great to have you all.</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Good to be with you.</p><p>FAULKNER: I'll start with you, Elizabeth. What do you make of this and what does it accomplish.</p><p>ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, REPORTER, VARIETY: It accomplishes us talking about it, that's for sure I have to tell you clearly I'm not--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: Wow, the bar is low.</p><p>WAGMEISTER: But clearly I'm not at the Toronto festival right now but many of my colleagues are. And I have to tell you it was sold out audience the premier, it was stand ovation. Getting a lot of attention.</p><p>But review not great. I do want to read you a quote from Varieties review. And by the way, our critics who wrote this review agrees with Michael Moore's politics. But from an entertainment standpoint, as you know I cover entertainment, not politics, this is what he wrote.</p><p>Quote, \"Fahrenheit 11/9 is a long and unwieldy (Ph) beast in a way that may hurt its chances with mainstream audiences. The days when even the liberal faithful would turn out in droves to see a Michael Moore movie are gone and this one, despite its title, lacked the catchy dramatic angle.\" So underwhelming from a critic's perspective.</p><p>FAULKNER: Yes. I stopped when you told me that your journalism co-workers votes in one way or the other my brain just froze.</p><p>Madison, attorney, you look at this. How do you see?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON TIMES: Yes. I think it's despicable. Hitler unleashed a war that resulted in essentially the industrialized murder of millions and millions of people to compare him to the president of the United States is sad. It's off base.</p><p>And what it comes down to is what we are seeing in the mainstream media right now which is Michael Moore already having a predetermined conclusion refusing to look at the facts and the realities of what's going on in this world.</p><p>FAULKNER: All right. A quick response and then I want to get to Elon Musk because I understand it's a very high occasion.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: I would just say it's obvious that Michael Moore wants to get liberal Democrats out to the polls as this was coming two months before the midterm election.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: Does this do it?</p><p>HOLLIDAY: Everything, the whole kitchen sink at Trump whether it's Nazis, whether it's different activists, whether it's Democratic socialists. Everything he could possibly can to mobilize the far left to get them out to the polls. We'll see if it works.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GESIOTTO: I have no idea.</p><p>FAULKNER: What happened to a positive message and talk about the economy? But what do I know? OK. So, Elon Musk, a tech, I don't know, would you call him a tech car giant? I mean those cars can do some --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, he's a pioneer.</p><p>FAULKNER: What do you make of this video? Can we roll it?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How does it work? Do people get upset with you if you do certain things tobacco and marijuana in there that's all it is? You like that? Clock?</p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA: Yes. This is a great clock.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. You want one? I'll get you one.</p><p>MUSK: Sure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK. Done.</p><p>MUSK: I like weird things like this. I'm not a regular smoker of weed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How often do you smoke weed?</p><p>MUSK: Almost never. I mean -- I don't actually any effect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FAULKNER: It is interesting if you are an owner of Tesla stock and you know the battle recently over whether or not he is fit to be running a company and the effect that that has on the stock, what does this do, Elizabeth?</p><p>WAGMEISTER: Not a good look. That is for sure. But to me, this just isn't surprising. Elon Musk smoking weed doesn't come as shocking.</p><p>FAULKNER: On a podcast? Really?</p><p>WAGMEISTER: Well, that's the thing, though.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: Again, the bar is low.</p><p>WAGMEISTER: He is the CEO, it's not a good look. You don't expect a CEO to do this. But it's Elon Musk who has spoken before about Ambien. He is not the typical CEO he dates Hollywood starlets who are half of his age. He has erratic behavior and he has explained that in the past.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: I think what is shocking in the stock price reflected it today is that it's shocking because he is the CEO of a major public company. And the stock is down 30 percent since his tweet about taking the company public in August.</p><p>It's coming on the heels of other controversies like you said he mentioned Ambien. Investors are generally terrified that he is in the tease suite. There's a lot of talk about shaking it up and he goes on a podcast and smokes weed. I mean, I think that that's what shocking to everybody.</p><p>GESIOTTO: And it's not just us that are concerned. Key executives have resigned from his company.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FAULKNER: Exactly.</p><p>GESIOTTO: Stocks is in free fall it's a mess over there. And the employees have talked about how concerned they are, they've seen him sleeping under desk sometime, on the floor.</p><p>WAGMESTER: Well, smart move, Elon, smart move.</p><p>FAULKNER: I was going to make an Ambien joke but I shouldn't.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: Just do it.</p><p>FAULKNER: A lot of people just talk it with a lack of fleet. But I do understand that, you know, as far as investors go, that is a huge deal. It's a serious deal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOLLIDAY: It's maddening to investor. And they read this headline and you know, since August, as like I said, 30 percent the stock has fallen since his tweet. That was maybe kind of a joke about taking the company private in August. Controversy after controversy after controversy. People are losing money.</p><p>FAULKNER: Helping the weed industry?</p><p>WAGMEISTER: I don't think it's that much of an effect. And by the way I do not think this is a smart move just to me it wasn't shocking because for Elon this seems to go in line with his character and what he has displayed before. What he spoke about before.</p><p>FAULKNER: Al right. Not on the bill necessarily for the night. But I wanted to mention it because we are seeing some real warrior woman power right now at the U.S. Open. We are in the State of New York. I don't know if you know about this.</p><p>Serena Williams have been moving in a that category the finals as a mom for the first time, second time because she went to Wimbledon, can she win it? Just a quick word about all that lady power.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: I'm loving Serena Williams right now. I can't get enough. I've been watching her matches, following her on Instagram.</p><p>FAULKNER: Get the baby.</p><p>HOLLIDAY: I mean, you go, girl.</p><p>GESIOTTO: Being a mom is one of the hardest jobs in the world.

Some of the companies don't have the best reputations, because they sue other businesses or use the threat of lawsuits to extract fees.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Critics, who derisively call these companies \"patent trolls,\" say they are costing the economy billions of dollars and stifling the creativity of people the patent system is designed to protect.</p><p>Count President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>among the detractors. He recently said patent trolls have a business model \"to essentially leverage and hijack somebody else's idea and see if they can extort some money out of them.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, the president followed up on his rhetoric with policy actions and legislative proposals designed to restrict patent-holding companies, also known as nonpracticing entities, from abusing the legal system. Among the proposals, he called on Congress to allow monetary sanctions on parties that file frivolous lawsuits.</p><p>The White House's actions drew sharp reaction from the Chicago legal community where people have been following the controversy.</p><p>Ray Niro Sr., a longtime patent lawyer who represents plaintiffs in patent infringement cases, said he couldn't disagree more with the president.</p><p>\"I think we're going down a dangerous path,\" Niro said. \"It's not a well-thought-out initiative. This is nothing more than an unprecedented attack on individual inventors.\"</p><p>David Donoghue, a patent lawyer who defends retailers in infringement suits, said something has to be done about nuisance suits, which can be expensive to litigate.</p><p>Since about 1999, 3,000 to 3,500 patent lawsuits are filed every year in federal courts. Like in any area of the law, some of the suits are going to be frivolous. The plaintiffs have weak or invalid patent claims. Yet they seek economic damages out of proportion with the nature of the claim or seek settlements that are less than the cost to defend.</p><p>One of the biggest explosions in patent disputes came in the area of software patents used in e-commerce. Hundreds of retailers, for example, were sued in 2010 by a patent-holding company called GeoTag Inc. for having websites that used store locater functions.</p><p>Big tech companies like Google, Cisco, Intel and Oracle say the questionable suits drain significant resources in legal fees, settlement costs and corporate attention.</p><p>To deter the questionable suits, the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>directed the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to tighten scrutiny of overly broad patent claims and require patent holders to disclose the owner of a patent. Sometimes the patent owner is a legal shell that only exists to file patent-infringement suits.</p><p>The White House also recommended seven ways Congress could address the issue through legislative changes, including better disclosure and financial penalties for bringing meritless suits.</p><p>But some legal experts questioned whether the White House's actions would stem the tide of nuisance lawsuits from nonpracticing entities.</p><p>There's no question that nonpracticing entities are filing more suits, said David Schwartz, an intellectual property scholar at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law. But there's not a lot of strong empirical evidence that the average case brought by a patent-holding company is meritless.</p><p>Part of the problem is that there is no clear definition of a patent troll. Many universities hold large patent portfolios and never produce a product. Some small inventors don't have the resources to bring their inventions to market. The only way these entities can monetize their patents is to seek licensing fees.</p><p>Moreover, several large tech companies are under pressure to make money off their patents. The latest trend is for these companies to sell some of their patents to nonpracticing entities. Some say companies are getting value back for their research and development but the practice also is causing legal problems.</p><p>Given the complexity of the patent system, the president has to be careful not to upset the market by targeting frivolous suits, Schwartz said. \"We need to focus on business practices that are wrong,\" he said. \"But making changes to a sliver of the patent system could have unintended consequences.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:asachdev@tribune.com\">asachdev@tribune.com</email></p><p>Twitter @ameetsachdev</p><p>ct13 0117 130605 N S 0000000000 00001615</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHTRIB-130604102171872</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHTRIB2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58K8-RDV1-DXY8-V0X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Chicago Tribune Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Tribune</publicationName><edition>Chicagoland Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>June 5, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

It was described as \"not just an excellent example of political writing\" but also \"a book which needed to be written\".</p><p>Meanwhile, the Crick prize for the best article in the journal Political Quarterly went to Helen Thompson of the University of Cambridge.</p><p>The prize-giving was preceded by a debate on the impact of the Grenfell Tower disaster on society. The writer Anthony Anaxagorou, who lost friends in the fire, urged the public \"to read more critically between the lines and to want more from their journalism\".</p><p>Orwell's son Richard Blair, who helped present the prizes, said his father would have cast a critical eye over the Grenfell disaster and the media response. \"Were he alive, and had this happened in his time, he would have very quickly cut through a lot of the obfuscation on all sides \u2013 both press and government.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-119559260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SN4-PM81-JDJN-62V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"378\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Yerepouni Daily News.
