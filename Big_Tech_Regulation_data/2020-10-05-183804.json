Made in China 2025[1] has garnered headlines for its ambition of making China the world's high-tech leader, prioritizing investments in artificial intelligence and robotics, biotechnology, semiconductors, and telecommunications. The strategy was inspired Germany's Industry 4.0[2], which seeks to leverage automation technologies to augment the capabilities of Germany's workforce to unlock productivity spikes. The EU more generally has expanded on German ambitions with its plan for digital sovereignty[3], an attempt to insulate European firms from foreign competitors, enabling them to grow and compete. </p><p>Against this backdrop is a United States where the internal conflict between the state and tech has reached its apex. While China is seeking to dominate global markets, exporting not only its technology, but its vision for an internet age abroad[4], the United States is signalling to the world that its largest tech firms are untrustworthy. As the European Union and more recently Russia, with its sovereign internet law[5] that licenses an alternative infrastructure to the American internet, attempt to close themselves off to American technology, the United States has imported standards[6] developed abroad.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Luckily, the threat this poses to national security has been noticed, but more needs to be done to protect the competitiveness of the American technology ecosystem. Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric of cutting costs in science and technology, Congress has been approving larger budgets for science agencies, most notable with a $195 million in funding[7] for President Donald Trump's National Quantum Initiative. The political will is growing, but American companies are not stepping up to execute. Initiatives to boost America's 5G capacity have moved away from Chinese provision, but instead of moving hardware home they have moved to Europe[8] with reliance on Nokia and Ericsson. Matt Stoller, of the left-leaning Open Markets Institute, noted[9] that the Oracle and Cisco were encouraged to help America build its own radio transmission technology to reduce reliance on Huawei for key 5G components, but both firms refused. Big Tech in general, with the tech libertarianism that has come to characterize its culture, has shown an antipathy to helping the United States achieve its strategic aims. Google employees boycotted[10] their firm for taking Pentagon defense contracts, yet the firm has gone out of its way to be welcomed in China. Some of this hostility can be justified on account of the Trump administration's hostility to Big Tech. Trump has repeatedly taken to Twitter to call out Google[11] for alleged anti-conservative bias and Amazon for what he deems anti-competitive behavior[12]. Congress has attacked[13] the CEOs of America's largest technology firms, and the threat of antitrust action on the flimsiest[14] of accusations are constantly bandied around. But the problem is not entirely the state's conflicting aims. Big Tech has shown little gratitude for the leadership of public initiatives such as DARPA in producing many of the most important technologies[15] that underlie their massive businesses. Public-private cooperation has been a cornerstone of American capitalism, enabling firms to access international markets that ensure their profitability. Hostility undermines the very ethos that created the open regulatory framework that allowed digital innovation in the United States to prosper.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  The American government nonetheless has the potential to build bridges and leverage its technological capacity for strategic ends. It can require more from firms who utilize publicly funded technologies[16] and remedy tax loopholes that effectively transform public investments into subsidies for large corporations. It can also do more to speak to technology firms as equals. Part of this comes with a change in rhetoric, pulling back on the attacks launched at Big Tech, instead extending a hand of cooperation. Another part comes from boosting state capacity. America's best and brightest have for too long been turned off by working for the state. By making working for the U.S. government a more attractive proposition, bringing in more bright STEM minds, more can be done to understand how to build America's technological might. Congress as well needs to have a better understanding of technology so that its pronouncements on technology can be seen as trustworthy. One of the means of doing so would be reviving the Office of Technology Assessment[17], that was defunded in 1995. This would bring in more technology insight for Congress, enabling them to be better prepared for hearings and in the crafting of regulations. The importance of a strong American technology sector is a bipartisan concern and one that gains increasing importance as technological might has become a bargaining tool on the global stage. The political will to strengthen America's national competitiveness requires cooperation with a tech sector that has lost faith in Congress. It is up to Congress to take the initiative to regain that trust.

Despite the Trump administration's rhetoric of cutting costs in science and technology, Congress has been approving larger budgets for science agencies, most notable with a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aip.org/fyi/2019/spending-deal-buoys-science-agency-budgets\">$195 million in funding</url> for President Donald Trump's National Quantum Initiative.

Big Tech has shown little gratitude for the leadership of public initiatives such as DARPA in producing many of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Entrepreneurial-State-Debunking-Public-Private/dp/0857282522\">most important technologies</url> that underlie their massive businesses.

It can require more from firms who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.amazon.com/Value-Everything-Making-Taking-Economy/dp/161039674X\">utilize publicly funded technologies</url> and remedy tax loopholes that effectively transform public investments into subsidies for large corporations. It can also do more to speak to technology firms as equals. Part of this comes with a change in rhetoric, pulling back on the attacks launched at Big Tech, instead extending a hand of cooperation. Another part comes from boosting state capacity.</p><p>America's best and brightest have for too long been turned off by working for the state. By making working for the U.S. government a more attractive proposition, bringing in more bright STEM minds, more can be done to understand how to build America's technological might. Congress as well needs to have a better understanding of technology so that its pronouncements on technology can be seen as trustworthy. One of the means of doing so would be reviving the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/12/18/congress-should-revive-the-office-of-technology-assessment-heres-how-to-do-it/\">Office of Technology Assessment</url>, that was defunded in 1995. This would bring in more technology insight for Congress, enabling them to be better prepared for hearings and in the crafting of regulations.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/06/19/gender-gap-stem-aei-study/\">(RELATED: The Gender Gap In STEM Still Exists, With Women Often Ahead: Study)</url></p><p>The importance of a strong American technology sector is a bipartisan concern and one that gains increasing importance as technological might has become a bargaining tool on the global stage. The political will to strengthen America's national competitiveness requires cooperation with a tech sector that has lost faith in Congress. It is up to Congress to take the initiative to regain that trust.</p><p>Ryan Khurana is executive director of the Institute for Advancing Prosperity.</p><p>The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.</p><p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We are live from the theater at Sahara, Las Vegas. I'm Erin Burnett.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are just four days away from the Nevada caucuses, a crucial contest for Democrats in the crowded 2020 primary campaign. The candidates are making one more final pitch to Nevadans, including the undecided voters right here in our audience tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, you just heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. We're going to keep it going now with one of his top competitors for the nomination, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Hello!</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Nice to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: I want to begin tonight with a question about the president and what's going on with the judicial system in this country, President Trump.</p><p>Tomorrow the leaders of an independent group of federal judges, I don't know if you all saw this, but they're going to be having an emergency meeting and they're going to be talking about President Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, how they've been handling these politically sensitive cases like Roger Stone.</p><p>More than 2,000 former Justice Department officials, as you know, have called for Barr to resign. Do you think he should, Mayor?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Absolutely. This really is an emergency. It is an emergency of legitimacy in our justice system. Our justice system only works if it is immune from the interference of politicians. And obviously this president, especially now that he feels emboldened after getting away with what he got away with during the impeachment, thinks he can just lean in and ask others to do the same, and interfere.</p><p>And one of the first criteria for my attorney general is that she or he will understand that she or he is the lawyer for the American people and not the personal lawyer of the president of the United States.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: I want to bring in Jamie Shay in our audience, she's from Henderson. She is retired but she is volunteering this week, Mayor Buttigieg, for the Democratic Party, in the caucuses on Saturday. And she is supporting you.</p><p>Go ahead, Jamie.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Mayor Pete, and thanks for coming tonight. You've not had a great amount of success turning around the lack of support of people of color, with your successes in Iowa and New Hampshire, your campaign has renewed excitement. But do you have a plan to gain the trust and support of more people of color as your campaign moves forward? And if so, how?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yes. First of all, thank you for your work for the party. It's so important.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And one of the reasons I'm proud to belong to our party is that our party reflects the diversity of our country. And, of course, we're thrilled with the successes that we've had top two finishes in the first two states. But most of the racial diversity of the electorate is in the states yet to vote, beginning right here in Nevada.</p><p>And I view this not as a political question, but as a question of how to make sure we can lead, in order not just to win, but to deserve to win. Now the reality is voters of color have every reason to be especially skeptical of politicians, especially new politicians. When voters of color, and I'm thinking in particular of black voters who have been the most reliable and loyal constituency in the Democratic Party, feeling that politics has not delivered for them, often feeling that our party has taken their support for granted, I understand why that bar is so high.</p><p>Not only that, but I am from a city that has a complicated story, just like America has a complicated story. I'm proud of the things we were able to get right, cutting black unemployment, cutting black poverty in our city. We were nationally recognized for race-informed work on economic opportunity. But we've also had tremendous struggles and a lot of unfinished business, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing. I'm seeking to earn the support of voters of color, first of all, by asking for it, and demonstrating that I understand that I am not entitled to anybody's support. And by laying out a vision for how the future can be a better one by proactive steps on everything from economic empowerment to reforms to our legal system that I know we must deliver in our time so that this can become a country where your race has no bearing on your health or on your wealth or on life expectancy or on your experience with law enforcement.</p><p>I also know that nobody is experiencing the pain of living under this administration more than voters of color. And that is why it is so important that we select a nominee who will put an end to the Trump administration, and I will continue working to demonstrate, to show, not just tell, that I am building the best campaign to do just that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So how do you -- you talk about obviously Nevada and South Carolina, and these are going to be the diverse states that are going to vote. And you have made progress, but you've got a long way to go when you look at the polls with people of color. Are you worried you're running out of time?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Again, I'm worried that America is running out of time. This is not just about my political fortunes, this is about whether our country can get this right. But what I'm going to do as a candidate is use every minute and every day that remains to find voters, look them in the eye, meet them where they are, and speak specifically to the challenges that black and Latino and AAPI Americans face, that Native Americans face that are of a piece with the American experience but also unique challenges that deserve specific attention.</p><p>[21:05:00]</p><p>BURNETT: So our next question comes from Karen Keehan, she's over here, a special education teacher. She works with students who have been emotionally traumatized and she's also currently an undecided voter.</p><p>Karen, go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION: Yes. Thank you for being here tonight, I appreciate it. As an educator here in Clark County School District, I participate in mandatory drills where I lock my door, draw blinds, ask students to shut down computers. They lay down on the floor, spread around the room. I explain they must be on the floor to avoid bullets coming through the windows and doors. To be more -- and then they need to spread out to be more difficult targets. They need to also turn off any screens that they have to prevent light from attracting the attacker.</p><p>What is your plan for remedying the terror that has become embedded in our schools?</p><p>(APPLAUSE) BUTTIGIEG: It is heartbreaking to hear you walk through that because it's in the specific way you described it, I'm thinking about terms like dispersion of targets and the difference between cover and concealment that are things that I learned as part of military training. And part of why I believed I was in the military was to serve potentially in conflict zones so that kids at schools in America would never have to have that experience.</p><p>And to see what we are accepting in terms of the expectation that this is just normal, that kids are going to have active shooter drills, sometimes before they're old enough to learn how to read, shows you that this country has its priorities wrong. Actually, no, Washington has its priorities wrong, because...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: You know, you look at something like universal background checks. It won't save every life. But it would make a big difference. This is something that the vast majority, not just of Democrats, but of Republicans, and gun owners already believe we ought to do. It's 80 or 90 percent support in America and we still can't get it through Washington.</p><p>It shows you what has to change in our political system. It shows the need for presidential leadership on this issue, because you are in such an important field. This, of all things, should not be your problem, and it certainly shouldn't be the problem of the children that you serve.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So this weekend, as you know, was the one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting. And the shooter was 19 years old. He had purchased his firearm. Florida moved to change that. So now the minimum age to purchase a gun in that state is 21 years old. Several of your opponents want to do the same thing on a federal level, make it you have to be 21 years old to buy a gun legally. Do you support that?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I would be very open to that. We have to do whatever we can to save lives. And it's not just background checks, it's not just age of purchase, it's also red flag laws. Ways to disarm domestic abusers or intervene when somebody is a danger, especially because the crisis of gun violence in our country, it's not just murder, it's suicide. And many of those suicides are preventable.</p><p>And I believe we also need to take action on assault weapons. Because the kinds of weaponry I trained on in the military has no business anywhere near an American school.</p><p>BURNETT: I want to bring in -- sorry, it was two years to Parkland, so. I want to bring in Alex Giuliani, a law student at UNLV who is currently undecided. Alex?</p><p>QUESTION: Hello.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Hi.</p><p>GIULIANI: We have seen our government neglect public education, welfare, and Social Security, because their donors have no stake in those programs. By allowing private health insurance to exist under your universal health plan, do you worry that those who can afford private insurance will lose their vested interest in maintaining the quality of national health care?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, what I'm proposing is a national health insurance program that I believe will be so good that everybody or almost everybody over time will choose it. And if I'm right, then it will eventually become the Medicare plan for our everybody.</p><p>But I'm not willing to assume that we're right. This is where I part ways with my friend Senator Sanders. He believes that we should require everybody to adopt that plan, whether they want to or not, when actually there's a lot of folks here in the state of Nevada, for example, culinary workers come to mind, who negotiated for good private plans, often traded wages as part of that.</p><p>Who are we to tell them they have to give it up? I believe that we should trust individuals to make the right choice for them. But I also believe that support will exist for this plan that I'm proposing we create. As a matter of fact, one of the things that I think is striking about the moment we're living in is we have a powerful American majority ready to support this reform, what I'm talking about, creating a public plan for everybody, just as long as we don't kick people off their private plans, then this has widespread support, which is really important at a moment when we have got to try to unify and not further polarize the American people.</p><p>[21:10:00]</p><p>It solves the problem. It brings us together. It's also paid for, which is more than you can say for Senator Sanders's plan. And I believe it is the best way to make sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So Senator Sanders actually has called the current -- the private health insurance system that we have now corrupt. That's the word that he has used. Do you also believe it is corrupt? And if you do, why do you want to leave it in place?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, again, I think that Americans should be able to decide for themselves. Now the private insurance industry attacked my plan the moment that it came out, I think because they don't want the competition. And what we're going to do is we're going to create this quality public plan, either they'll come up with something better and they'll stay in business, or they'll fail to come up with something better and they'll go out of business. Either way works.</p><p>The important thing is not whether the government is providing your coverage. The important thing is that you get great coverage one way or the other. And I'll leave it to the private players to figure out if they can measure up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So you've said undocumented immigrants should have been able to receive coverage through Obamacare. This is something that you've said in the past, and you've addressed that in your health plan. Now let's just say you're the president of the United States. You go to Congress. You're trying to pass the bill. And that becomes the roadblock, that you're just not able to get it through if you're going to provide access for undocumented immigrants. Would you be willing to put it aside, or is that something you will not drop?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I'm going to fight to make sure that anybody can participate on this plan, because if we are excluding people from the ability to get in on health insurance, we're not just harming them, we're punishing ourselves. We become a less healthy country. More people will be in emergency rooms because they can't get the preventative treatment that they need up front. And more people will be sick.</p><p>Nobody wins when that is the case. And so I will do everything in my power to make sure that when we deliver this plan, we do it in a way that everybody can participate.</p><p>BURNETT: Is it fair to say, just to be clear, that health insurance for undocumented immigrants is a deal-breaker for you?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I can't game out every amendment or poison pill, every change they're going to try to make to bring the package together. What I'll say is that that is one of the pillars of the plan as I see it.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. I want to bring in Donald Fagan. He's a student at UNLV, currently undecided. So go ahead, Donald.</p><p>DONALD FAGAN, STUDENT, UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, LAS VEGAS: Hi, Mayor Pete. Candidates such as Senator Sanders have criticized your campaign support from billionaires. Many Americans feel like their voices are often disregarded in favor of those with larger wallets. How can the average voter be certain that you will represent their interests first? And will you pledge to make overturning Citizens United and removing money from politics a day one priority as president?</p><p>(APPLAUSE</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: So the answer to your second question is, yes, I will. Citizens United is a disaster for our democracy. And if what it takes to fix Citizens United is a constitutional amendment, then I think that's exactly what constitutional amendments are for. Let's not be afraid and let's launch that fight on day one.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And as far as defending the interests of those who aren't wealthy, I have the smallest wallet of anybody running for president right now. They did a ranking in Forbes magazine. And I'm officially the least wealthy presidential candidate right now. So when I'm talking about the interest of middle class, I'm also talking about our own. And I got into politics, I got into campaigning in order to be part of solutions for folks like my neighbors, folks like my own family.</p><p>And I also believe that at a time like this, we've got to get help from everybody who is willing to support our bold vision for the future. My campaign was driven and is driven by hundreds of thousands of individuals who have donated. As a matter of fact, if you're watching right now, you can go to peteforamerica.com, send in 5 or $10, because that is the lifeblood of our campaign.</p><p>But if there are some people a lot wealthier than I am who want to be part of that, who want to chip in, great, because we're getting ready to go up against Donald Trump and his allies, who have been raising hand over fist in order so much money in order to hold on to their grip on power.</p><p>And my campaign is one that's never going to define itself by whose help we reject. My campaign is about belonging. It's about bringing everybody into the picture and standing side by side with everybody determined to make sure that we end the Donald Trump presidency and deliver a better future for Americans.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So when you said you want to not be defined by who you reject, last hour, I don't know if you heard Senator Sanders, but he would not commit to accepting money from Michael Bloomberg if Michael Bloomberg is not the Democratic nominee. Right, he has pledged to help whoever is.</p><p>Would you take his money and his support if you are the nominee?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Sure. As a matter of fact...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Look, right now, obviously I'm competing against Mayor Bloomberg. We have, I think, different approaches and different visions. But his philanthropy supported a million dollar effort in our community to help low-income people get transportation to go to work.</p><p>[21:15:00]</p><p>I'm not going to reject that help because it came from a very wealthy person. This is the moment to bring everybody that we can into this effort.</p><p>And I promise exactly one thing in return for any contribution, which is we're going to take that contribution and use it to go beat Donald Trump.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) BURNETT: So, you know, you talk about something he did in your community, but obviously Amy Klobuchar has said Bloomberg is, her words, hiding behind his ad spending. Elizabeth Warren says he has bought his way on to the debate stage. Bernie Sanders has accused him of trying to buy the entire election.</p><p>Pretty simple question, yes or no. Do you think Michael Bloomberg is trying to buy the Democratic nomination for president?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yes. Yes. I mean, what else do you call it? What else do you call it when you dip into your endless reserves of millions and billions and don't go through the process of campaigning in states like Nevada or Iowa or New Hampshire, humbling yourself, going into the diners and the backyards, looking eye to eye to voters?</p><p>Look, my campaign wouldn't exist if all that mattered was how much money and fame you start with and how you get yourself on the air. We built this thing from nothing. And we built it by having those conversations and letting voters pick apart what you have to say.</p><p>And to try to just go around that by throwing colossal sums of money on television, shows you what's wrong with our system. And I also believe it's not the best way to pick our nominee or the next president.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So I want to bring in Kristen Makhathini now. She is a realtor and she is from Henderson, Nevada. She previously had supported Senator Kamala Harris. So she is now undecided. Go ahead with your question, please.</p><p>QUESTION: Thanks. Hi, Mayor Pete, thanks for spending time with us tonight. As a fellow Episcopalian and Christian, it is very frustrating to hear so much of the public discourse that assumes that being a Christian equals evangelical Christian conservatism. My Episcopalian belief and Christianity teaches me the values of scripture, tradition, and reason. I am a Democrat and a Christian, you can be both.</p><p>How can you use your voice as president to share this viewpoint more broadly when the right thinks they own it?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, I'm glad to be with a fellow Episcopalian. And I agree. It starts with sending the message that God does not belong to a political party. And...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And by the way, you know, it's also very important to make clear that the presidency and the Constitution, and my presidency will belong to people of every religion and of no religion equally. This is not about imposing my faith on anybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: But I have got to say, like you, I find a message in scripture that is very different from what the political right seems to want to talk about all the time, a lot about poverty, a lot about compassion, a lot about humility that I seek in my imperfect way to live up to, and that does have implications for how I will approach public office.</p><p>And the time has come to send a message that people of faith have a choice. And if you belong to a Christian tradition or any moral or religious tradition that emphasizes making yourself useful to the oppressed and standing with and identifying with the prisoner, and welcoming the stranger, the stranger by the way is another word for immigrant. Yes that has implications in public life and I won't be afraid to talk about how my positions are informed by my faith.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So, you know, to the point you talk about, about God not belonging to any kind of political party, at the last CNN town hall, you said if your faith calls upon you to help the marginalized, those who are afflicted, to comfort -- to comfort people, to strive for humility and decency, as the Christian faith does, and then I quote you, \"then I just can't imagine that that requires of you that you be anywhere near this president.\"</p><p>Do you think it is impossible to be a Christian and support President Trump?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christians. But I will say, I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything that I find in scripture. Now I guess that's my interpretation. But I think that's a lot of people's interpretations. And that interpretation deserves a voice.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: All right, we are going to be back with more from presidential candidate, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, right after this break.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>[20:20:00]</p><p>BURNETT: And welcome back to Sahara Las Vegas. We're here with Democratic presidential candidate, the former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for a live town hall.</p><p>So one thing that people might not know about you is that you speak eight languages. Am I missing one?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Depends what you mean by speak. Some -- some better than others.</p><p>BURNETT: OK. OK. All right, but among them, Norwegian and Maltese...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Uh-huh.</p><p>BURNETT: ... which has a lot of X's in it and all kinds of things. So, you know, I was thinking, like could you say something in one of them? And I'm like, here we are, and I didn't want to make it, you know, too easy, but something like, I don't know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Oh, wow. Yeah, let's see. In Maltese, it would be something like (speaking Maltese) I think. A bunch of Maltese people are going to like tweet me how I got that wrong.</p><p>BURNETT: There's no winning on this one, by the way.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, and Norwegian (speaking Norwegian) I don't know. Anyone Norwegians here? I don't know.</p><p>BURNETT: You couldn't get immediately...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: As far as everybody here knows, that was right.</p><p>BURNETT: OK.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I hope.</p><p>BURNETT: So which of them -- because, I mean, when people hear eight languages, I mean, most of us speak one or we struggle to kind of comprehend a second. What was the hardest to learn?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Maltese is actually really hard, because it's this mix. So my father emigrated from Malta. It's one of the smallest countries in the world. It's got its own language. And it's a mix of everything -- it's a Semitic language.</p><p>[20:25:00]</p><p>It's got parts of Arabic in it. There's a bunch of Italian and some English going on.</p><p>Like, the basic way to say hello in Maltese is to say, \"All right?\" And thank you in Maltese is \"Thank you.\" And -- but you also say grazie, which is Italian. It's like a whole -- but, you know, the languages that are the most different from English are obviously the most challenging. And you don't get to practice a lot of them.</p><p>BURNETT: No, I know, like I say, it's all those X's. Is there a time, though, that you can think where knowing one of these languages helped you help someone else?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yeah. I remember the day the travel ban went into effect. And we were in Houston -- at the time I was seeking to be DNC chair and decided to go down and participate in the protests on the travel ban. And there was a rumor going that an Iranian family had been caught up in the situation that -- you know, they were being caught at customs and weren't being allowed through because of the ban.</p><p>Anyway, we were there at the terminal. And there was this amazing scene. It was a protest that had been organized almost on the spot by a young woman who was a server at a Carrabba's. It showed you the power of online organizing. And within a few hours, hundreds of people were at the airport, and we were -- they were calling for the travel ban to be lifted.</p><p>And then there was a stay, I think, in court. And so this family started coming through. And they were being mobbed by TV reporters, and I realized that they might not have had any idea of why there were all these protesters, cameras, or anything. So I went up.</p><p>And I learned -- to go to -- to deploy to Afghanistan, I learned Dari, which is kind of like Farsi, which is the language of Iran. So I see this man emerge, kind of Middle Eastern appearance. His wife is in a hijab. They got three or four little kids. A bunch of suitcases. They look exhausted.</p><p>And I went up to them and started trying to ask, you know, are you OK? Do you understand what's happening? Do you need any help? Everybody is here to support you. And the more I tried to say this in Farsi, the clearer it became that he -- he didn't understand me at all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And then I realized he was an Arabic speaker. And I studied Arabic in college. I'm not very good at it, but I'd studied it. And had this conversation -- he had no idea what was going on. He was actually Jordanian, and he just wanted to go home.</p><p>And meanwhile, there -- because I'm wearing a tie, the reporters from one of the local TV stations think that I'm his lawyer and they start interviewing me. And one of them was from Telemundo, which was in Spanish, and they were asking me to try to ask him questions in Arabic, which I'm not that good at, and they were asking me in Spanish. And it was a real mess.</p><p>But in the end, I just realized there was this crowd chanting and cheering, and they didn't know what was going on, so I just grabbed the luggage cart to help him and his wife, and just got them out of there to the garage where his cousin was waiting to pick him up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Got him where he was going.</p><p>All right, I want to bring in Dave Comarow. He is a retired patent attorney from here in Las Vegas. And you say you're undecided, as well. Go ahead with your question, Dave.</p><p>QUESTION: Mayor Buttigieg, welcome to our humble little town. BUTTIGIEG: Great to be here.</p><p>QUESTION: I hate that anybody has to ask this question, but, Mayor Pete, if you do become the nominee, how are you going to deal with the almost certain flood of personal attacks based on your sexual orientation?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, it'll happen, and I'm ready. You know, when I decided to come out in...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thanks. When I decided to come out in -- it was during a re-election year in South Bend. I was up for mayor. I decided, after my deployment, that I was just too old to not have a personal life and made that personal decision, not knowing what the effect on my career would be or on being able to win.</p><p>Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana then. And it was tough sledding for -- as it still is for many LGBTQ people in the state where I come from. And I just decided I had to do it. And what wound up happening was that I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And what that tells me was that, at the end of the day, people were ready to judge me based on the job I was doing for them. But I also think it's important to recognize that change on these issues and acceptance and equality, even though it's got a long way to go, it's also happened at a pace that a lot of people are struggling with.</p><p>And I think for those who haven't quite found their way all the way to the right side of history, it's important to beckon them in the right direction. I remember not long after I started dating Chasten, and I ran into a woman I knew in South Bend, older generation, a little more conservative. And she kind of gave me this mischievous pat on the arm, and she said, \"I met your friend the other day, and he is wonderful.\"</p><p>You know, that could have been a moment to give her a lecture on the difference between, you know, your friend and your partner. But what I realized was, in her way, she was kind of inching toward the</p><p>[21:30:00]</p><p>of acceptance, she felt good about it, she felt good that she was moving in that way. And I think in a moment like this, it's really important that we find those who are maybe not quite there yet, and help them get there instead of clubbing them over the head and telling them they're bad people until they see it just the right way. And I think that's a really important part of where our politics needs to go.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So last week, Rush Limbaugh made homophobic comments about you and he said that America is not ready, he doesn't think, for a gay president. Now, then Limbaugh -- I don't know if you know -- but he gave this whole story today that President Trump told him don't apologize...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Oh, great.</p><p>BURNETT: ... for saying anything he said. Publicly, though, Trump says that he would not have a problem supporting a gay candidate. Do you take him at his word?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, not if he's sending out his supporters to talk in this way. And, look, I mean, the idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I mean, I'm sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So they want to debate family values? Let's debate family values. I'm ready.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Our next question is from Nick Elefantis. He is a high school government teacher. He is from Las Vegas and also undecided. Nicholas, please.</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening, Mayor Buttigieg. It's widely acknowledged that the public education system in Nevada and across the nation is broken. Part of it is due to the attrition of teachers. We're faced with low salaries and crippling student debt. What can be done to help keep hard-working, highly qualified teachers in their job, instead of looking for the door?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yeah.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You may see Chasten, who's right next to you, is nodding along, because he's a teacher with high student debt and who has dealt with low compensation. So we as a household -- you know, we understand what you're going through.</p><p>And it is so important that we recruit and motivate and empower teachers to be in that profession. It's such an important profession. And yet, as we talked about earlier, teachers are now being expected to convert into highly trained armed guards if there's a threat to the classroom. You're finding part of your job automated by the over- reliance on test administration.</p><p>And then there's the simple fact that teachers are not paid enough. We can do something about that. And we should do something about that with federal funds.</p><p>So I'm proposing that we triple the funds going into Title I in particular. Those are dollars that go into low-income districts, which is where having a great teacher is especially impactful, because low-income students, and disproportionately black and brown students, will perform better and earn more in the future, be more economically empowered if they have the best teachers.</p><p>We also, I think, need to lift up the profession as a whole. I'm proposing we create a...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Yeah. I'm proposing that we create an Education Access Corps. The idea would be to link up high-quality teaching programs across the country. And if you participate in them, and then commit to teaching in one of those Title I programs, you have a portable teaching license you could take anywhere, and you get your student loans forgiven, if you do have that debt, in exchange for agreeing to be a teacher in such an important area.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Bottom line is, as I like to say is that if we respected our teachers just a little more like we do our soldiers and paid our teachers just a little more like we do our doctors, this country would be a better place for all of us.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So you were talking about federal funding and what you would do with federal funding. Elizabeth Warren, some of your opponents, have called for complete freeze, no federal funding for new charter schools. Do you think that makes sense?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that we need to not have a meat cleaver approach on this, but insist that any charter schools are set up in a way that will benefit traditional public schools, too. It can't just be up to whether you win a lottery that you have opportunity.</p><p>We've got to make sure -- charters can have a role in piloting new ideas or innovations, but they have to be subject to the same accountability and the same scrutiny as traditional public schools. And they should be funded at a comparable level.</p><p>So if we're talking about federal funds being used in a way that would tilt the scale, and then a charter school that gets more money says, see, we got better results, but it's just because they had more resources, that's not fair.</p><p>What we've got to do is make sure that any innovations that are going on in the space of education go in a way that would ultimately reach students at every kind of</p><p>[21:35:00] traditional public school in the country. And I neglected to mention one other thing, talking about teachers and how important that job is. There are a lot of people in school buildings and in classrooms, teachers, but also paraprofessionals and other educators and support staff who are also very much underpaid, and it's important that we, I think, speak to that, as well. I meant to mention that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Johnathan Carter is also a teacher. He's a high school English teacher, part-time college instructor here in Las Vegas, currently undecided, but I believe, Jonathan, leaning towards Mayor Pete. I don't know how he's done tonight for you, but that's what you were I think coming in the door. Go ahead with your question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Hopefully I can bring you across, then.</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Hi.</p><p>QUESTION: The president of the United States has been accused of not always telling the truth about some of the most basic issues concerning Americans.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: That's diplomatic.</p><p>QUESTION: I try. If you are in a debate with him, what will be your approach to ensuring that his mistruths do not go unchecked while still communicating your own vision for the country and not allowing yourself to become nothing more than a fact-checker?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: You know, it's a great point. I think this president is kind of like one of those Chinese fingertraps, you know, the harder you pull, the more you get stuck in them. Because he has this way of commanding our attention by doing something outrageous or telling a lie. And if he -- if he tells a lie, you've got to correct it. If he does something racist, you got to confront it. If he insults a war hero, you got to stand up to it. And yet the moment you do that, you're starting to get sucked into his game.</p><p>And so I believe the discipline that's going to be required of any nominee, and the discipline I plan to bring to that debate stage, is to be ready very quickly to correct his lies and to confront his wrongdoing, but to put it in its place quickly enough that we deny him his famous ability to change the subject.</p><p>Because the real subject of this election is our lives. And that's a winning issue for us. We're the ones trying to get you a raise. We're the ones ready to deliver paid family leave, serious about climate change, prepared to do something about gun violence, standing up for workers and unions. On the things that are going to affect whether our lives go better in the future, I believe we've got all the best answers.</p><p>I think he knows that, and that's why he needs us arguing about whatever crazy nonsense he can use to dominate the news. And so my overall philosophy on how to defeat this president, especially how to debate this president, is, yeah, you've got to stand up to him sometimes, but the less we're talking about him, the more we're talking about you, and that's how we're going to win.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: You know, it's amazing how many people just in casual conversation talk about this, the debates, and how they imagine the debates between Trump and whomever the Democratic nominee is. So you touched on this a little bit, but how would you on a debate stage balance between responding to him, whether -- whatever it is he's saying or sometimes, as you mentioned, it could be five or six topics in one answer, responding and not letting him dominate the conversation?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think it's to remember what the election is about. I believe that every election is about the voter asking one question: How is my life going to be different if you're president instead of you?</p><p>And when it comes to the things that are going to decide our lives and our children's lives going better or worse, we have not only a strong message, we have the majority of the American people with us.</p><p>You know, Democrats are so used to being in a defensive crouch politically, we forget this sometimes, but the American people are with us on wages, with us on health, even with us on guns and with us on immigration reform, issues where we used to hesitate to say what we really believe. The American people are already there.</p><p>We've just got to make sure that we keep the focus on those basic questions. And I will maintain the discipline to keep that at the center of this election and of the debates themselves.</p><p>BURNETT: And so how do you reach voters -- because you're going to want some of these voters to listen to you, to possibly vote for you -- who get their news from sources that are very friendly to the president and may not be aware of the fact that he may be saying something false?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, well, that's why I go on some of those networks. It's a controversial decision. I took some heat in my party. But in addition to appearing on networks like CNN, you're going to see me on networks like Fox News. Not because I'm under any illusions about their objectivity, but how can -- in a world where people are starting to get their own information from their own sources and even have their own facts, how can we be surprised if somebody's not responding to my message if they've literally never even heard it?</p><p>How can we be mad at them for believing a lie, if it's the only thing that ever got to them? And those tendencies are only going to increase with these social media bubbles. That's why I think it's very important to pop those bubbles, to cross through different media, and I'm doing it as a candidate, I'll do it as president, too.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So our next question is from Brian Linsey. He owns a moving and a storage company here in Las Vegas. He's currently leaning towards supporting you, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>[21:40:00]</p><p>Go ahead, Brian.</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening, Mayor Pete. Good afternoon, Chasten. Welcome to Las Vegas to both of you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Thanks.</p><p>QUESTION: Measures to enact legislation to protect our climate and natural resources invariably run into GOP resistance, typically prevented as, \"This will cost us jobs\" or \"This will hurt the economy.\"</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: How do you protect our climate and protect our economy from job loss simultaneously?</p><p>And would you -- would you support a specific legislative proposal for a carbon tax and rebate?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I will. That's the answer to the last part. Because I believe it would play a very important role in making sure that our economy and the prices in our economy accurately reflect the true cost of businesses as usual.</p><p>Remember, the most costly thing we could possibly do is to stay on the path that we're on. And that's not just a moral cost; that's a dollars and cents cost because the catastrophic effects of climate change, which we're already beginning to see, are only going to increase.</p><p>So the idea of a carbon tax and rebate, or a carbon fee and dividend, whatever you want to call it, is that we assess a fee on the price of carbon. But, at least in my plan, we would rebate that right back out to the American people.</p><p>And I'd do it on a progressive basis so that most low and middle- income people would be made more than whole. This is not about taking money out of the economy. This is about making sure that the economy accurately reflects the cost of carbon pollution and climate change. And that's part but only part of how we're going to meet these needs.</p><p>Now, you're right, there has been a lot of partisan resistance to doing the right thing, whether it's climate, whether it's protections for federal lands, for air and for water. But here's another example, kind of, like what we were talking about earlier with guns, where, actually, there's a lot more agreement among the American people than there is on the floor in Congress.</p><p>Right now, most Americans, including in conservative states, believe in protecting public lands, believe in making sure we have clean air and water.</p><p>Now, there are some who have been made to feel like they are part of the problem, if you're working in certain kinds of industry, for example. Ironically, those are some of the very people whose skills we will need to recruit in the next generation of those industries that have to be carbon-free.</p><p>There is no question there will be a transition. And I'm proposing that we invest over $200 billion in supporting workers through that transition. But we also estimate that we will create at least 3 million net new jobs by taking the action we must as a country to mobilize and fight climate change.</p><p>And some of these jobs are -- might sound a little new-fangled, high- tech green jobs. A lot of them are jobs that are perfectly easy to understand right now. I'm talking about building trades. I'm talking about union carpenters and electrical workers and insulators and glaziers that we're going to need just to get our buildings to where they will have to be retrofitted for -- for us to stay ahead of the climate challenge.</p><p>So we've got to break this idea that we're choosing between doing the right thing for our climate and doing the right thing for our economy. The only way forward, for our economy, for our future, for our children and for our climate, is to step up, come together, deal with carbon pollution and lead the world in doing something about it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So earlier tonight, Senator Sanders was talking about the Green New Deal, which he supports. And one of the key tenets of the Green New Deal is a federal jobs guarantee, which he happens to also support. Do you support a federal jobs guarantee?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I want everybody to have an opportunity to work, but I wouldn't structure it in the same way that Senator Sanders is talking about.</p><p>What I would do is make sure not only that we're supporting everyone's ability to get training for jobs that are growing -- I mean, remember, we have shortages right now in key areas, from direct care workers to -- to educators.</p><p>BURNETT: That's true.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: But, also, I'm proposing that we create a national service program, a million paid voluntary national service opportunities a year, to help get people that experience of working on something important. In fact, a big part of it would be a climate core, and then other parts of it could be decided by local communities, so that we set everybody on the path to success, whether they're going to ultimately go to college or whether they're going directly into the workforce.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. We're going to take a very brief break. When we come back, we'll have more with Mayor Pete Buttigieg, right after this.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: And welcome back. We are live from Las Vegas with former mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>[21:48:36]</p><p>So I want to ask you about something else that happened this morning. And I know you're out on the campaign trail, but I know there's no way you missed this, President Trump commuting the sentence of the former Illinois governor and \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(BOOING)</p><p>... Rod Blagojevich, the former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik, Michael Milken, the financier, and a former NFL owner.</p><p>My question, though, is who would be at the top of your list for possible presidential pardons?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I would start with nonviolent drug offenders caught up in the racial disparities of the failed war on drugs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I mean, look, I actually think presidential clemency power can be an important part of how we de-carcerate a country that is shockingly over-incarcerated.</p><p>I mean, if incarceration made a country safe, we'd be the safest country in the world, and we're not. It's bad enough just by the numbers, but when you add to that the racial disparities of who has been incarcerated often for nonviolent offenses, or those who have aged out of being any threat and could contribute in their communities.</p><p>That's where I would be paying my attention. This president -- it seems like he's never met a corrupt politician he didn't like.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's one thing about him that actually is bipartisan, is his fondness for corrupt politicians. (LAUGHTER)</p><p>And it's just, to me, the absolute wrong direction to even think about that pardon power.</p><p>BURNETT: I want to bring in Chelsea Johnson. She's a student at Nevada State College who is undecided tonight.</p><p>[21:50:00]</p><p>Go ahead, Chelsea.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Mayor Pete.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Hi.</p><p>QUESTION: I was wondering what you plan to do on protecting everyday citizens' valuable data that has been collected and sold by social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: What a great question. And it's an example of one of the issues that the next president is going to face that hadn't even been thought about, really. a few years or decades ago.</p><p>And we don't have a national policy on data security or on data privacy. Different states have them. So basically, we have 50 different policies across the country. And not only that, we're relying on very outdated legal protections.</p><p>Just think about this. When you download an app, you have that thing you've got to scroll through about 18 pages of fine print and then you just click \"Agree,\" right? Nobody reads what's in there. There could be anything in there. But in the eyes of the law, that counts as a legitimate legal binding document on your relationship with that company and what's going on with your data.</p><p>It's why I believe we need to set a national standard, even when you give your data to a company, on what they can and can't do with it, certain rights that we have over data, especially when companies are making money off of it.</p><p>And that means accountability for the big tech companies like Facebook and Google and Amazon, but also companies of any size can act in very problematic ways with our data.</p><p>So the time has come to create a body of law that will set those left and right boundaries. We can't just leave it to the companies to regulate themselves, the way we have been.</p><p>And we need leaders who can understand this. You know, we've seen several times now the spectacle of a tech executive appearing before a committee of elected officials who make it abundantly clear that they have no concept of what it is they're supposed to be regulating. We have to make sure we bring the right expertise not just in elected office but in terms of who is appointed to hold these companies accountable and establish a new and tighter framework for what they can and can't do with our personal data.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: This is Lisa Krueger. She's a former precinct captain and delegate at the Nevada convention in 2016, also a retired flight attendant. She's undecided but I believe leaning towards supporting Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>QUESTION: Yes.</p><p>BURNETT: OK. There we go. Go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Mayor Pete. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Also, congratulations on all fronts. You're doing an amazing job and it's wonderful.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You are one of the most exciting candidates that I've seen in decades. But I am curious why the senior population seems to love you so much and the younger crowd, the students, aren't quite as up to date with that.</p><p>I have an 86 year-old father and he loves you. He says \"Mayor Pete\" -- in fact, he thinks you're a doctor. He goes, \"Dr. Pete.\" I'm like, \"No, he's a mayor. He's a mayor.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, all right. He's promoted me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION: But he loves you and he's so behind you, and then I ask my 32 year-old son and he said, \"Well, I mean, yeah, he's OK.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I'm like -- so I'm just curious about that.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Yeah. So I don't know all the reasons for that. You know, even when I was running for mayor, when I was in my 20s, we found that older voters were likely to be the most supportive. I wonder, maybe, if it's partly that the longer you've been here and you've seen leaders of different ages and generations succeed and fail, maybe it demystifies, a little bit, the idea that age is the same thing as wisdom. I don't know.</p><p>What I do know is that we're going to continue reaching out to everybody. Of course, we're thrilled to have a lot of support -- and one thing that was very encouraging in those first two contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, was that we did do well with voters of different age brackets as well as different educational experiences and different kinds of communities, urban, rural and suburban.</p><p>And I have a message for young people, too. And it's the longer you're planning to be here, the more the decisions that are about to be made will affect you personally. I am running to be the most progressive president we will have had in the last half century. But, crucially, I'm also running to do it in a way that can actually start to bring America together and unify a frighteningly divided American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And that will continue to be my message as I reach out to voters of all generations.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So maybe a \"grass is greener\" thing. And, look, nobody -- older people may want to be younger and younger people want to be older. But a new poll out just a few hours ago showed 40 percent of voters either have some reservations or are very uncomfortable about a president under 40 years old. I can tell you, when you hit that number, it doesn't feel so great. However, you're not there yet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>What would you say to them?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, again, I think that, look, every candidate, every person, is different. But let's not equate age with wisdom. After all, we've got the oldest president in American history and how's that working out for us right now?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: So, if you were elected, or when -- if you're the nominee.</p><p>[21:55:00]</p><p>You get a code name, Secret Service code name.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Oh.</p><p>BURNETT: Do you have any kind of thoughts on what you might want that to be?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: One of the many, many ways in which I'm very different from this president is I'm not great at thinking up nicknames. I'll...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNETT: That's true. He would have had several choices at the ready for this when he...</p><p>(UNKNOWN): (OFF-MIKE) BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, I'll -- I'll leave it to others to figure that out. But that's a fun one to turn over in my mind.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNETT: All right. And -- and for the young voters, I do wonder, what do you say to those young voters? Does it -- do you think to yourself, \"Why is it that people my age or people in their 20s and they can look at you and look at your husband and they should have a lot in common? Why is it that they are sometimes wary?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, again, I think everybody ought to be wary right now. I mean, so much is at stake in the decision that we are about to make. We've got to make sure we have a nominee who can win and defeat Donald Trump. And we've got to make sure we have somebody who's going to keep the promises that they are making.</p><p>And I don't blame anybody for being skeptical about my candidacy or any candidacy. But what I'll also say is that, you know, we have worked to show, not just tell, in the course of our campaign, how we can build a life in this country that will be one of belonging, that will not just be about getting the policies right but opening up a better era to just live in and be an American.</p><p>And I want to reach out to people of every background, every age group and also make clear that, whether you support me or not, I'm running to be a president for you as well. And I will support you in your life, no matter who you supported in this election.</p><p>BURNETT: Well, we thank you very much for your time tonight, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Coming up next, presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar. She will join Anderson Cooper. We will be back on this stage and we will be back right after this.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020021802CNV54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7R-VJT1-JB20-G1HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Live Event</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Buttigieg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dems</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Campaign</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Revocation &amp;

Do you ensure that everyone is always \"in like\" with you? Do you tell white lies so that people don't think you're a neghead? Yes, yes and yes? Time to wipe that fake smile off your face - you are suffering from toxic positivity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the American psychotherapists Jamie Long and Samara Quintero, toxic positivity is the \"excessive and ineffective overgeneralisation of a happy, optimistic state across all situations\". In a widely read recent post on their website, they wrote: \"When positivity is used to silence the human experience, it becomes toxic.\" Examples include trying to \"just get on with it\" by dismissing emotions, minimising the experiences of others with feelgood statements, and shaming people for expressing anything other than positivity. Toxic positivity is a dogma that insists, they write, \"that only keeping positive is the right way to live your life\".</p><p>Who could blame us, given the barrage of motivational mantras and #livingmybestlife hashtags. \"Social media sets us up to showcase the best aspects of our lives,\" Quintero says. \"But anything that creates a mask is not authentic.\" It's hard to resist, though, says Scarlett Curtis, whose latest book, It's Not OK to Feel Blue (and Other Lies), serves as a healthy antidote. \"Posting about the best parts of your life can reflect onto your real life, so it becomes this continuing cycle of trying to maintain the illusion.\" The multibillion-pound beauty and wellness industries are also in on the conspiracy, telling you, Long says, that \"you need to look your best and live your best life - oh, and don't leave home without full-coverage foundation\". The pressure is on.</p><p>At best, toxic positivity is smug and superficial; at worst, it's bad for our health and can make us unhappy. The issue with toxic positivity, according to Susan David, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change and Thrive in Work and Life, is that \"it implies that some emotions are good and some are bad - and that bad emotions are not allowed\". David points the finger at the happiness movement: \"What gets lost in the wellintentioned message to 'be happier' is that being unhappy is an authentic human experience that has evolved to help us thrive as a species.\" Your bad mood, she says, is simply data that informs you how to adapt to environmental threats. Parental guilt, for example, signals that \"you value connection with your kids and you're feeling a it's toxic Positivity tHat causes fragility, wHereas being Honest about your feelings leads to agility and resilience lack of it\". Boredom at work shows that you value learning, but aren't getting enough. \"When we dismiss these emotions, we become less practised in understanding what the discomfort is telling us, and therefore fail to develop skills to deal with the world. There is a cost to our resilience, and we become less happy.\" When emotions are denied, she adds, they get stronger. \"There is a rebound effect - internal pain always comes out - but it's a faulty, passive way of being in the world.\"</p><p>Indeed, Long and Quintero have observed the toxic build-up in their clients. \"Most say they're overwhelmed with stress and anxiety,\" Long says, \"but when we take a deeper look, we find that the toxic-positivity style of coping is very common.\" Failing to express a broad range of emotions affects our ability to regulate our stress response, she explains, and therefore causes intense stress reactions, such as anxiety, depression and IBS.</p><p>If you're starting to feel like a happiness failure, don't worry, the backlash is coming. \"There's fatigue around the Goopish pursuit of constant perfection,\" says Lucie Greene, founder of the LA-based forecasting agency Light Years. She attributes the pushback in part to feminism, and its \"sophistication in understanding the biases and seeing through the constructs that make us feel bad\".</p><p>So are you ready to #speakyourtruth? At a talk earlier this year, the feminist author Chidera Eggerue announced the end of her \"Little Miss Nice\" persona. \"I've become a lot more direct,\" she says, \"because I don't see how far it's got us by playing nice. I am no longer invested in making the world comfortable for my oppressors, when I could be using that same energy to centre my own happiness.\" And did the world end? Apparently not. \"I have found myself in a lot more debates,\" she concedes, \"but it's empowering. I've also developed more meaningful relationships.\" In fact, she adds, \"I wish I could go back in time and do all this earlier.\"</p><p>Curtis posts crying selfies because \"if my feed is too positive, it doesn't feel like a reflection of me \u2026 It gets rid of the shame I hold. People respond to it better. They're sick of seeing the other stuff.\"</p><p>It is the act of \"moving our uncomfortable emotions out of our body\", say Long and Quintero, that \"keeps us healthy and relieves the tension caused by suppressing the truth. Accepting ourselves as we are is the path to a robust emotional life.\"</p><p>But will we become emotionally incontinent snowflakes? \"I'm not suggesting that we have to act on every single feeling,\" says David, whose concept of emotional agility is that we notice and accept our inner world with compassion and curiosity. \"It doesn't mean that you need to have it out with whoever you're upset with.\" Indeed, it's toxic positivity that causes fragility, she says, whereas \"being honest about your feelings leads to agility and resilience\".</p><p>What about anger, though? Can we really let rip with such a stigmatised emotion? Is rage permitted? \"There's a difference between honouring your emotions versus acting them out unhealthily,\" Quintero says. \"I can feel rage, but that doesn't give me permission to express it in a way that harms me or those around me. What makes a human being healthy is the ability to cope with all our feelings, especially the uncomfortable ones.\"</p><p>One of the bastions of toxic positivity is the workplace. \"If you open up at the office, you could risk losing face with those in power, you could risk losing your job,\" Quintero says. That said, the workplace is ripe for disruption. According to Long, recent research shows that when leaders don't embrace vulnerability, it leads to more silence and less risk-taking - not ideal for increasing productivity and satisfaction. And, yes, authenticity and vulnerability have to come from the top: \"If the leaders aren't modelling that, their employees won't,\" she says.</p><p>You can always blame Silicon Valley, whose \"yes culture\" has gone global, Greene says. \"Employment is generally so unstable, everyone has become obsessed with positivity as a way to survive.\" But a culture of consensus isn't necessarily best, as it prevents critical thinking. \"Conflict can be constructive,\" she says. The good news is that, according to Greene, \"millennial talent is not buying the big-tech work culture. We've been sold on sloganeering for a long time, but people are starting to call BS on it. Young people are taking a much more critical view.\"</p><p>Yup, the kids will save us. Greene foresees a gen-Z exodus from Instagram in order to protect their mental health. Their feeds are already full of candour. \"They're 10 times more honest than me,\" Curtis says. \"For them, social media is just an extension of who they are, it's not a mask,\" unlike those who had social media \"imposed\" on them. Long states that the only resistance she has received has been from baby-boomers, who \"feel this is overly indulgent and we should just tough it out\". It's their loss. \"Discomfort is the price of admission to the meaning of life,\" David says. \"Only once we've accepted our discomfort can true human change really happen.\" Go on, dare you. .</p><p>How to be less tP Don't expect absolute happiness - it's more likely to be found in daily micro-experiences such as a hug.</p><p>Own your emotions.

TPB...</p><p>125 Views   Print   Interview    By Foo Boon Ping     In this edition of the Digital Reinvention Series, TPBank CEO Nguyen Hung shares how the bank\u2019s digital transformation is being anchored not just on technology, but also right mindset of its staff and process.    TPBank\u2019s goal is to build a win-win partnership with neobanks and fintechs, instead of treating them as rivals   TPBank investing in new and critical platforms such as AI, Big Data, Biometrics and Open API  The bank is undertaking POC (proof of concept) projects in its digital transformation initiative to pilot ideas on reasonable scales and minimise financial loss and other risks    Tien Phong Commercial Joint Stock Bank, popularly known as TPBank, has been in the thick of digital transformation for years now as it aspires to be the leading digital bank in Vietnam. Although a relatively new financial institution \u2013 having been founded just in May 2008 \u2013 TPBank\u2019s digital banking services and products are becoming more and more diversified and friendly to customers.    TPBank prides itself as inheriting strength from strategic shareholders, including DOJI Gold &amp; Gems Group, FPT Group, Vietnam National Reinsurance Corporation (Vinare), SBI Ven Holding Pte. Ltd (Singapore), IFC International Finance Company (under World Bank) and PYN Elite Fund.    In July 2012, the bank appointed Nguyen Hung as Chief Executive. Nguyen, who was re-appointed CEO in September 2020, has 30 years of experience in the banking and finance sector, including more than 20 years of senior management.    Nguyen discusses in this instalment of the Digital Reinvention Series TPBank\u2019s investment in emerging digital platforms to drive better results in key areas such as risk management, human resources management and marketing. He also emphasises the need to invest in people through education and training to make sure they have the right mindset as they balance innovation with development.    FOO BOON Ping (FBP): What does \"reinvention\" mean to you personally?    NGUYEN HUNG (NH) : \u201cReinvention\u201d to me is to constantly find something new, to renew myself, and to be better at what I\u2019m already doing. It doesn\u2019t have to be something brand new that has never been found or been done by anyone. As long as it is new knowledge to me and brings me new experiences which help me improve myself, that is what I try to do every day.    Digital banking is transforming the landscape in Vietnam &amp; ASEAN, with neobanks and big tech challenging the traditional banks. In your opinion, where is the future headed for banks like yourself?    The rise of fintech is clearly getting more powerful than ever. Even though it does bring challenges to traditional banks, I don\u2019t think of fintechs &amp; neobanks as rivals. I\u2019d like to think they\u2019re \u201cpartners\u201d. As innovative as they are, there are some businesses that fintechs &amp; neobanks have not been able to do but only traditional banks can. After all, traditional financial institutions have been around for hundreds of years, they cannot be replaced so easily in a day or two.    That\u2019s why I believe cooperation is the best way to go. We want to work with fintechs &amp; neobanks for their expertise in technology and offer them ours in providing financial services as well as risk-management, to build a win-win partnership.    TPBank is a rather young bank and we keep ourselves open-minded. We also establish fintech departments within ourselves so that we can guarantee to have both the advantages of advanced technology and traditional banking expertise.    What does \"reinvention\" mean for your bank and what you're trying to drive? Why is it so important?     \u201cReinvention\u201d process for our bank means both digitization and digitalization . Some projects are about digitizing parts of the original process to better suit the current demand. However, some other projects require a complete transformation of the product to meet our customers\u2019 expectation. In a way, it is the balance between invention and reinvention .    In essence, with every project, customers\u2019 benefit will be our main focus, and we try to balance our economics and technological resources to make strategic decisions. Naturally, all resources have their limitations. Therefore, it is the CEO\u2019s duty to prioritize multiple investments. Only by doing that can we maintain our competitive advantages yet balance our financial book and guarantee the confidence of our shareholders, while serving the customers to the best of our abilities.    What role is technology playing in the reinvention of the bank? Can you give us some  examples of technologies in use and how they're supporting this?    Technology is surely one of the three most important links in the reinvention of the bank. Along with that is People (or \u201cMindset\u201d) and Process. I believe that only when these three elements work together to change can we come up with new and advanced financial products / services.    For the time being, we are investing in new and critical platforms such as AI, Big Data, Biometrics and Open API. These technologies will not only play a big part in creating new and improved products / services for our customers, but also benefit us in terms of managing certain operations of a financial institution such as risk management, human resources management, marketing, etc.    With a technology partner like Backbase, our time to market has been significantly shortened as it took only 10 months from kick-off to successfully migrate nearly 1 million customers to the new platform. And in the 8 th month, TPBank\u2019s team could confidently take over the development process.    The new microservice architecture allowed us to expose to BackBase\u2019s services and to different partners. Overall performance of the system was also greatly enhanced even with millions of request per day.    With reinvention comes risks and failures. What professional \u201cfailure\u201d have you survived?    For us, digital transformation is not simply a project, but it is a strategic roadmap that includes many experiments and POC (Proof of Concept) projects. Due to the frequent changing of customers\u2019 habits, all of our plans must have high agility, which means they can be done quickly with minimised impacts so that we can start over if they don\u2019t work out.    Much like all financial institutions, our investments can\u2019t always be successful; we have made the wrong bets at times. What we\u2019ve learned from our failures is to carry out POC projects, to pilot our ideas on reasonable scales, and to always have an exit strategy so as to minimise financial loss and other risks. For example, we have set up a pilot environment of nearly 10,000 employees, which is proof of how cautious we are when we aim to alter customers\u2019 behavior in general.    How are you teaching people at your bank about risks and failures?    There are always occupational hazards in any work that we do, maybe even more so in the banking industry, as these hazards can involve issues like finance, reputation and the law. Therefore, understanding, classifying and managing risks are extremely important to the bank.    At the same time, we must have the right mindset when it comes to risk management so as to balance with innovation and development. Simply put, risks should be classified based on characteristics as well as severity. Once that\u2019s done, we can come up with suitable action plans.     Banks don't necessarily have the best reputation and it's a highly regulated market. How do you think your bank can become the bank that people love?    Our slogan is \u201cA deeper understanding\u201d, which means whatever we choose to do eventually is to bring meaningful values to our customers. TPBank does its best to understand the customers\u2019 needs and even to foresee what will benefit them most in the future. We believe once our customers see how our products / services can better their lives, we\u2019ll naturally become \u201cthe bank that people love\u201d.    That being said, TPBank\u2019s goal has always been to bring true values to society, not simply build up our reputation and status.    What are your personal aspirations for the new year?    This year we were met with the Covid-19 challenge and so our priorities must change accordingly. For our customers, we\u2019re doing whatever we can to help promote the economy and overcome the damage of this pandemic by debt restructuring, interest and fee reductions. For our employees, we\u2019re currently providing them with the best working conditions and opportunities without resorting to pay cut or staff reduction. For our shareholders, we\u2019re maintaining profitability as planned by reducing costs and minimising losses.    In the first quarter, we can still closely follow the plan and have nearly the highest growth rate in the industry. However, the rest of the year will be very challenging and we must stay focused in order to guarantee growing profit.    What personal advice do you have for people wanting to follow in your footsteps?    In my opinion, there needs to be a transparent and cooperative top-down digital transformation strategy that transpires from the leadership to every employee. As I mentioned above, technology is only one-third of the answer. What we need to invest in is the people, or their mindset to be exact, through education and training. Only by that can we make real changes to a system with old habits that\u2019s been around many years.   next</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42619280024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CH-V2H1-F07F-81VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The Asian Banker</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC0001SBK</classCode><className>NATIONAL REINSURANCE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6331 FIRE, MARINE, &amp;

And yes, we're here at the SuperReturn  Conference in Berlin who is who and one of the big who's here with me is  Todd Sisitsky.  He's managing partner at TPG Capital just came off the  stage and sharing his thoughts with the audience here.  And Todd, I have to  ask you, you know, we're coming in the news of hearing President Trump last  night, talk about the appeal and replacement of Obamacare that's something  you've been working as a healthcare expert.  What is this mean for the  private equity industry?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SISITSKY:  It is.  Well, thank you and I appreciate it.  Who's too very  generous, but, you know, we has spent a lot of time in healthcare that's  been my day job is really been just one of the co-heads in the healthcare  investment activities of TPG.  And we spent a lot of time tracking the  regulatory change.</p><p> The real story in healthcare though (ph) has been that the majority of the  changes happened below the surface.  The incredible rate of position  employment, the shift in the cost to the employee, all the things have been  seismic changes in healthcare.  We're change for the last five years and  probably there previous four or five decades</p><p> Process create a lot of opportunity.  If you can be in a weigh of volume,  if you can improve the cost efficiency of health care services you can make  great investment, great, great companies.  We have been invested in kind of  11 companies in last two funds, and the companies we track for years, deal  over years and we've had six strategic exits to - just give the buyers over  the last three or four years.  And, you know, and candidly if you can  better the (inaudible), right, in a kind of dislocation and change, you can  benefit as to what is around the corner, I think as we continue to change I  think there's really a lack of clarity right now in terms of what will come  out in Washington, but I think it will be sometimes for health care  investments.</p><p> KELLY: That more investors to come, you think it help you?</p><p> SISITSKY:  More investment would come absolutely.</p><p> KELLY:  Absolutely.  Good.  Well, in one of the big things here is that  where in the world of wash with money, you know, record levels being raise  for private equity fund, I got to think it's hard to stand out in the world  like this.  How do you do it?  How do you -- what's the pitch?</p><p> SISITSKY:  Well, I appreciate I -- that's absolutely true.  I've been  hearing about two (inaudible) for at least the last 20 years of my career,  but it's true.  And is actually even more true today because in some  respects, you know, we're returning capital into the capital we're  investing it at the pace that we've plan and retreat capital at almost  three times about this.  And there's a lot of capital, and people want  their allocations and private equity.  You know, we need to do and what all  the LPs and a lot of the most important partnership here and I talk about  is really stick to our needing and stick to our strategy.  For us, it's  pretty clear.</p><p> We invest very heavily in our sector teams.  We spend years thinking about  not friends whichever (inaudible) the themes, the investable themes with in  the sectors that we can deploy resources against that we can create an  ecosystem around, not only find opportunities, they're differentiated.   Oftentimes actually even this world proprietary, some in proprietary.  But  then companies that we can grow once we own those companies.  So, I think  of that as long term, sector-driven investors.  I think this is growth  investors.  I think that we spend those years looking for the company,  looking for the management team and once we own that business where to keep  investors and we're going to keep growing that until we create something  really special.</p><p> KELLY:  Do you feel you (ph) can get harder with all that money out there.</p><p> SISITSKY: I think it does, but I think what it really speaks to is you just  have to stick to what you're good at.  So, in this world there's kind of  tension (ph) between what's interesting and what's actionable.  The  actionable are the investment bank companies, (inaudible) company that that  goes to 10 or 12, your closest friends.  You got a chaperone dinner and a  couple of hours the management.  We've found we're not very good at the  actionable without angles or without a perspective.  We'll spend a time in  interesting even if we have to put 50 long lease in the water to get two  over five or 10 years that end up three into by IMS, Quintiles at SCA.   Some of the deals that, you know, that I've been involved with.</p><p> And for us towards that payoff and I think actually, you know, in  environment like this, it's all be more important that your figure out what  you're strategy is, you build your ecosystem, invest in your ecosystem and  incur it in ecosystem and then you take your time find the things we have  to differentiate angle and you got one frankly.  The deals that we need to  build out, our portfolio with the last couple of years, and then exactly  consistent we dry to do, even if the world got more competitive in a lot of  respects.</p><p> KELLY: One area where it's been especially competitive at technology, seven  of the last, seven of the 10 biggest deal of last year were intact.  It's  the space you've played in.</p><p> SISITSKY:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  Can you continue to be competitive given all the money that's  there?  You're chasing after big tech deals, you got snap going public this  week, what's feel there?</p><p> SISITSKY: You know, I think we can be very competitive.  We have an  excellent team there.  In fact, a lot of our activity we usually spend  there.  So, if you think about technology, you have to go to for the sub- sector (ph).  Just thinking about for example cyber-security, the two  crimes the people for the most is identity being stolen, their computers  being hacked, and this is an area that obviously very important, it's  becoming more top in mind.  We have been folks in that for years.  We've  gone a series of small investments, tiny and - series of small investment  for a growth found that have helped us understand what the landscape is.   And after of years of knocking the door, you know, we have now taken back  the - in partnership with the parent company, Intel, and what was specially  for a proprietary dialogue.  And we and entail, are totally convince that  we can take it to the next level.  We have ecosystem forward, we have  specific plan.  It wasn't been (inaudible) process.  It, again, importance  of really focusing ahead of time, it content media, CAA, our investment in  CAA.  Ultimately investment in Cirque du Soleil, these are all, again, the  result of years of working and what we think of these different segments of  technology where we can have a differentiated approach, differentiate  angles.</p><p> KELLY: Todd Sisitsky, managing partner at TPG Capital, thanks for spending  a few minutes with us on a very busy day.</p><p> SISITSKY: Thank you, Jason.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

And yes, we're here at the SuperReturn Conference in Berlin who is who and one of the big who's here with me is Todd Sisitsky. He's managing partner at TPG Capital just came off the stage and sharing his thoughts with the audience here. And Todd, I have to ask you, you know, we're coming in the news of hearing President Trump last night, talk about the appeal and replacement of Obamacare that's something you've been working as a healthcare expert. What is this mean for the private equity industry?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SISITSKY: It is. Well, thank you and I appreciate it. Who's too very generous, but, you know, we has spent a lot of time in healthcare that's been my day job is really been just one of the co-heads in the healthcare investment activities of TPG. And we spent a lot of time tracking the regulatory change.</p><p>The real story in healthcare though (ph) has been that the majority of the changes happened below the surface. The incredible rate of position employment, the shift in the cost to the employee, all the things have been seismic changes in healthcare. We're change for the last five years and probably there previous four or five decades</p><p>Process create a lot of opportunity. If you can be in a weigh of volume, if you can improve the cost efficiency of health care services you can make great investment, great, great companies. We have been invested in kind of 11 companies in last two funds, and the companies we track for years, deal over years and we've had six strategic exits to - just give the buyers over the last three or four years. And, you know, and candidly if you can better the (inaudible), right, in a kind of dislocation and change, you can benefit as to what is around the corner, I think as we continue to change I think there's really a lack of clarity right now in terms of what will come out in Washington, but I think it will be sometimes for health care investments.</p><p>KELLY: That more investors to come, you think it help you?</p><p>SISITSKY: More investment would come absolutely.</p><p>KELLY: Absolutely. Good. Well, in one of the big things here is that where in the world of wash with money, you know, record levels being raise for private equity fund, I got to think it's hard to stand out in the world like this. How do you do it? How do you -- what's the pitch?</p><p>SISITSKY: Well, I appreciate I -- that's absolutely true. I've been hearing about two (inaudible) for at least the last 20 years of my career, but it's true. And is actually even more true today because in some respects, you know, we're returning capital into the capital we're investing it at the pace that we've plan and retreat capital at almost three times about this. And there's a lot of capital, and people want their allocations and private equity. You know, we need to do and what all the LPs and a lot of the most important partnership here and I talk about is really stick to our needing and stick to our strategy. For us, it's pretty clear.</p><p>We invest very heavily in our sector teams. We spend years thinking about not friends whichever (inaudible) the themes, the investable themes with in the sectors that we can deploy resources against that we can create an ecosystem around, not only find opportunities, they're differentiated. Oftentimes actually even this world proprietary, some in proprietary. But then companies that we can grow once we own those companies. So, I think of that as long term, sector-driven investors. I think this is growth investors. I think that we spend those years looking for the company, looking for the management team and once we own that business where to keep investors and we're going to keep growing that until we create something really special.</p><p>KELLY: Do you feel you (ph) can get harder with all that money out there.</p><p>SISITSKY: I think it does, but I think what it really speaks to is you just have to stick to what you're good at. So, in this world there's kind of tension (ph) between what's interesting and what's actionable. The actionable are the investment bank companies, (inaudible) company that that goes to 10 or 12, your closest friends. You got a chaperone dinner and a couple of hours the management. We've found we're not very good at the actionable without angles or without a perspective. We'll spend a time in interesting even if we have to put 50 long lease in the water to get two over five or 10 years that end up three into by IMS, Quintiles at SCA. Some of the deals that, you know, that I've been involved with.</p><p>And for us towards that payoff and I think actually, you know, in environment like this, it's all be more important that your figure out what you're strategy is, you build your ecosystem, invest in your ecosystem and incur it in ecosystem and then you take your time find the things we have to differentiate angle and you got one frankly. The deals that we need to build out, our portfolio with the last couple of years, and then exactly consistent we dry to do, even if the world got more competitive in a lot of respects.</p><p>KELLY: One area where it's been especially competitive at technology, seven of the last, seven of the 10 biggest deal of last year were intact. It's the space you've played in.</p><p>SISITSKY: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Can you continue to be competitive given all the money that's there? You're chasing after big tech deals, you got snap going public this week, what's feel there?</p><p>SISITSKY: You know, I think we can be very competitive. We have an excellent team there. In fact, a lot of our activity we usually spend there. So, if you think about technology, you have to go to for the sub- sector (ph). Just thinking about for example cyber-security, the two crimes the people for the most is identity being stolen, their computers being hacked, and this is an area that obviously very important, it's becoming more top in mind. We have been folks in that for years. We've gone a series of small investments, tiny and - series of small investment for a growth found that have helped us understand what the landscape is. And after of years of knocking the door, you know, we have now taken back the - in partnership with the parent company, Intel, and what was specially for a proprietary dialogue. And we and entail, are totally convince that we can take it to the next level. We have ecosystem forward, we have specific plan. It wasn't been (inaudible) process. It, again, importance of really focusing ahead of time, it content media, CAA, our investment in CAA. Ultimately investment in Cirque du Soleil, these are all, again, the result of years of working and what we think of these different segments of technology where we can have a differentiated approach, differentiate angles.</p><p>KELLY: Todd Sisitsky, managing partner at TPG Capital, thanks for spending a few minutes with us on a very busy day.</p><p>SISITSKY: Thank you, Jason.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

I think that we spend those years looking for the company, looking for the management team and once we own that business where to keep investors and we're going to keep growing that until we create something really special.</p><p>KELLY: Do you feel you (ph) can get harder with all that money out there.</p><p>SISITSKY: I think it does, but I think what it really speaks to is you just have to stick to what you're good at. So, in this world there's kind of tension (ph) between what's interesting and what's actionable. The actionable are the investment bank companies, (inaudible) company that that goes to 10 or 12, your closest friends. You got a chaperone dinner and a couple of hours the management. We've found we're not very good at the actionable without angles or without a perspective. We'll spend a time in interesting even if we have to put 50 long lease in the water to get two over five or 10 years that end up three into by IMS, Quintiles at SCA. Some of the deals that, you know, that I've been involved with.</p><p>And for us towards that payoff and I think actually, you know, in environment like this, it's all be more important that your figure out what you're strategy is, you build your ecosystem, invest in your ecosystem and incur it in ecosystem and then you take your time find the things we have to differentiate angle and you got one frankly. The deals that we need to build out, our portfolio with the last couple of years, and then exactly consistent we dry to do, even if the world got more competitive in a lot of respects.</p><p>KELLY: One area where it's been especially competitive at technology, seven of the last, seven of the 10 biggest deal of last year were intact. It's the space you've played in.</p><p>SISITSKY: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Can you continue to be competitive given all the money that's there? You're chasing after big tech deals, you got snap going public this week, what's feel there?</p><p>SISITSKY: You know, I think we can be very competitive. We have an excellent team there. In fact, a lot of our activity we usually spend there. So, if you think about technology, you have to go to for the sub- sector (ph). Just thinking about for example cyber-security, the two crimes the people for the most is identity being stolen, their computers being hacked, and this is an area that obviously very important, it's becoming more top in mind. We have been folks in that for years. We've gone a series of small investments, tiny and - series of small investment for a growth found that have helped us understand what the landscape is. And after of years of knocking the door, you know, we have now taken back the - in partnership with the parent company, Intel, and what was specially for a proprietary dialogue. And we and entail, are totally convince that we can take it to the next level. We have ecosystem forward, we have specific plan. It wasn't been (inaudible) process. It, again, importance of really focusing ahead of time, it content media, CAA, our investment in CAA. Ultimately investment in Cirque du Soleil, these are all, again, the result of years of working and what we think of these different segments of technology where we can have a differentiated approach, differentiate angles.</p><p>KELLY: Todd Sisitsky, managing partner at TPG Capital, thanks for spending a few minutes with us on a very busy day.</p><p>SISITSKY: Thank you, Jason.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Last week, the agency sent out a stark warning on security concerns about the videoconferencing app Zoom. On the same day, the prime minister held the government's first-ever virtual cabinet meeting. The platform he chose to host this historic event? Zoom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To make matters worse, Johnson tweeted a screengrab revealing thumbnail images of awkward-looking ministers with microphones muted, along with their usernames and the meeting number - enough information to give any hacker a field day.</p><p>The role of big technology companies has come under scrutiny as the coronavirus forces billions of people to adapt to life on lockdown. Apps such as Zoom and Houseparty, another social video platform, have become pervasive, allowing workers to communicate with their colleagues and families to stay connected.</p><p>Zoom, which made pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 of $26.4m (\u00a321m) on sales of $622.7m, has been one of the standout successes in this field. The company, founded by Chinese-born billionaire Eric Yuan, floated last year with a share price of $36. It had rocketed to $151.70 by the end of last month, but fell back to $128 on Friday to give Zoom a value of $35.8bn.</p><p>The sell-off came after repeated concerns about Zoom's ability to protect its users' data. The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, asked last week whether Zoom had reviewed security processes since the start of the virus outbreak and its surge in popularity.</p><p>The use of technology to communicate during the lockdown is just one part of the story. More significantly, governments and health services across the world are looking to tech developers to help monitor the spread of the virus, carry out more accurate testing - and potentially help speed up sufferers' recovery.</p><p>The NHS is working with the American tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Palantir, as well as Londonbased Faculty, to use the health service's data to help predict where resources will be needed most.</p><p>All this raises questions over data security and privacy - although a report last year from the National Data Guardian found that about seven in 10 people in England would give up some personal data if it led to benefits such as access to new technologies, lower costs and improved patient care.</p><p>Doing so, however, brings increased risks of data falling into the wrong hands, or being misused in the future.</p><p>\"There is a concern about people using the Covid-19 banner to drive unwelcome behaviours,\" said Jason du Preez, chief executive of Privitar, which builds data security software for private and public organisations. \"If data is used and traded beyond that scope [of the coronavirus], it would be a total disaster. There's a real chance it will happen.\"</p><p>There is a balance to be struck between protecting civil liberties and making the best use of technology, experts say. In China, smartphones have been monitored and people forced the to submit their body temperature for checks. This tight surveillance helped the government contain the outbreak largely in the Hubei province where it emerged, rather than allowing it to spread across the country.</p><p>More primitively, in India, some of those forced to selfisolate have had their hands Boris Johnson'stamped with indelible ink.</p><p>In Britain, such intrusion would not be tolerated.</p><p>However, the NHS is examining plans to develop a location-tracking app that would alert people if they had been in contact with someone testing positive for the coronavirus. The idea is based on a study published in the journal Science, which recommended that the service should be voluntary.</p><p>Some observers believe that the introduction of such new technology during the crisis will mark the start of a new relationship between Big Tech - which has suffered from a \"techlash\" related to the industry's handling of personal data - and its customers.</p><p>\"The trust issue melts away when people are afraid for their circumstances: they sacrifice quite a lot more than they would in normal times,\" said Greg Francis, managing director of Access Partnership, which lobbies governments on behalf of big tech companies. \"That includes rights and privileges such as privacy.\"</p><p>There has been a surge of new apps designed to spot symptoms or deal with the fallout from coronavirus. Despite a willingness of regulators to work with tech companies, there are still laws to be obeyed.</p><p>\"Developers need to consider at the outset the privacy implications of what is being developed,\" said Emma Burnett, head of data protection at the law firm CMS. \"This will involve being transparent to individuals, including what is being processed and why.\"</p><p>When people are afraid, they will sacrifice rights such as privacy</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Boris Johnson's virtual cabinet meeting using Zoom betrayed security flaws have had their hands</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-158856105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YKH-4MW1-JCBW-N20H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 5, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001804</classCode><className>VIDEO CONFERENCING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPHO</classCode><className>VIRTUAL EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX002058</classCode><className>DISEASE AGENTS &amp;

Last week, the agency sent out a stark warning on security concerns about the videoconferencing app Zoom. On the same day, the prime minister held the government's first-ever virtual cabinet meeting.

Zoom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To make matters worse, Johnson tweeted a screengrab revealing thumbnail images of awkward-looking ministers with microphones muted, along with their usernames and the meeting number - enough information to give any hacker a field day.</p><p>The role of big technology companies has come under scrutiny as the coronavirus forces billions of people to adapt to life on lockdown. Apps such as Zoom and Houseparty, another social video platform, have become pervasive, allowing workers to communicate with their colleagues and families to stay connected.</p><p>Zoom, which made pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 of $26.4m (\u00a321m) on sales of $622.7m, has been one of the standout successes in this field. The company, founded by Chinese-born billionaire Eric Yuan, floated last year with a share price of $36. It had rocketed to $151.70 by the end of last month, but fell back to $128 on Friday to give Zoom a value of $35.8bn.</p><p>The sell-off came after repeated concerns about Zoom's ability to protect its users' data. The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, asked last week whether Zoom had reviewed security processes since the start of the virus outbreak and its surge in popularity.</p><p>The use of technology to communicate during the lockdown is just one part of the story. More significantly, governments and health services across the world are looking to tech developers to help monitor the spread of the virus, carry out more accurate testing - and potentially help speed up sufferers' recovery.</p><p>The NHS is working with the American tech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Palantir, as well as Londonbased Faculty, to use the health service's data to help predict where resources will be needed most.</p><p>All this raises questions over data security and privacy - although a report last year from the National Data Guardian found that about seven in 10 people in England would give up some personal data if it led to benefits such as access to new technologies, lower costs and improved patient care.</p><p>Doing so, however, brings increased risks of data falling into the wrong hands, or being misused in the future.</p><p>\"There is a concern about people using the Covid-19 banner to drive unwelcome behaviours,\" said Jason du Preez, chief executive of Privitar, which builds data security software for private and public organisations. \"If data is used and traded beyond that scope [of the coronavirus], it would be a total disaster. There's a real chance it will happen.\"</p><p>There is a balance to be struck between protecting civil liberties and making the best use of technology, experts say. In China, smartphones have been monitored and people forced to submit their body temperature for checks.

Moving forward there is undoubtedly much more that we can and will do with the Internet, and part of that innovation will, naturally, require a reconsideration of existing laws and how new Internet-enabled modalities fit into them.  But when undertaking such a reconsideration, the goal should not be simply to promote Internet-enabled goods above all else; rather, it should be to examine the law's effect on the promotion of new technology within the context of other, competing social goods. In short, there are always trade-offs entailed in changing the legal order. </p><p>As such, efforts to reform, clarify, or otherwise change the law that affects Internet platforms must be balanced against other desirable social goods, not automatically prioritized above them.  Unfortunately \u2014 and frequently with the best of intentions \u2014 efforts to promote one good thing (for instance, more online services) inadequately take account of the balance of the larger legal realities at stake. And one of the most important legal realities that is too often readily thrown aside in the rush to protect the Internet is that policy be established through public, (relatively) democratically accountable channels. Trade deals and domestic policyRecently a letter[1] was sent by a coalition of civil society groups and law professors asking the NAFTA delegation to incorporate U.S.-style intermediary liability immunity into the trade deal. Such a request is notable for its timing in light of the ongoing policy struggles[2] over SESTA \u2014a bill currently working its way through Congress that seeks to curb human trafficking through online platforms \u2014 and the risk that domestic platform companies face of losing (at least in part) the immunity provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. But this NAFTA push is not merely about a tradeoff between less trafficking and more online services, but between promoting policies in a way that protects the rule of law and doing so in a way that undermines the rule of law. Indeed, the NAFTA effort appears to be aimed at least as much at sidestepping the ongoing congressional fight over platform regulation as it is aimed at exporting U.S. law to our trading partners. Thus, according to EFF[3], for example, '[NAFTA renegotiation] comes at a time when Section 230 stands under threat in the United States, currently from the SESTA and FOSTA proposals baking Section 230 into NAFTA may be the best opportunity we have to protect it domestically.' It may well be that incorporating Section 230 into NAFTA is the 'best opportunity' to protect the law as it currently stands from efforts to reform it to address conflicting priorities. But that doesn't mean it's a good idea. In fact, whatever one thinks of the merits of SESTA, it is not obviously a good idea to use a trade agreement as a vehicle to override domestic reforms to Section 230 that Congress might implement. Trade agreements can override domestic law, but that is not the reason we engage in trade negotiations.  In fact, other parts of NAFTA remain controversial[4] precisely for their ability to undermine domestic legal norms, in this case in favor of guaranteeing the expectations of foreign investors. EFF itself is deeply skeptical[5] of this 'investor-state' dispute process ('ISDS'), noting that '[t]he latest provisions would enable multinational corporations to undermine public interest rules.' The irony here is that ISDS provides a mechanism for overriding domestic policy that is a close analogy for what EFF advocates for in the Section 230/SESTA context.  ISDS allows foreign investors to sue NAFTA signatories in a tribunal when domestic laws of that signatory have harmed investment expectations. The end result is that the signatory could be responsible for paying large sums to litigants, which in turn would serve as a deterrent for the signatory to continue to administer its laws in a similar fashion.  Stated differently, NAFTA currently contains a mechanism that favors one party (foreign investors) in a way that prevents signatory nations from enacting and enforcing laws approved of by democratically elected representatives. EFF and others disapprove of this.  Yet, at the same time, EFF also promotes the idea that NAFTA should contain a provision that favors one party (Internet platforms) in a way that would prevent signatory nations from enacting and enforcing laws like SESTA that (might be) approved of by democratically elected representatives.  A more principled stance would be skeptical of the domestic law override in both contexts.Restating Copyright or creating copyright policy?Take another example: Some have suggested[6] that the American Law Institute ('ALI') is being used to subvert Congressional will. Since 2013, ALI has taken upon itself the project to 'restate' the law of copyright. ALI is well known and respected for its common law restatements, but it may be that something more than mere restatement is going on here. As the NY Bar Association[7] recently observed: The Restatement as currently drafted appears inconsistent with the ALI's long-standing goal of promoting clarity in the law: indeed, rather than simply clarifying or restating that law, the draft offers commentary and interpretations beyond the current state of the law that appear intended to shape current and future copyright policy.  It is certainly odd that ALI (or any other group) would seek to restate a body of law that is already stated in the form of an overarching federal statute. The point of a restatement is to gather together the decisions of disparate common law courts interpreting different laws and precedent in order to synthesize a single, coherent framework approximating an overall consensus. If done correctly, a restatement of a federal statute would, theoretically, end up with the exact statute itself along with some commentary about how judicial decisions have filled in the blanks differently \u2014a state of affairs that already exists with the copious academic literature commenting on federal copyright law. But it seems that merely restating judicial interpretations was not the only objective behind the copyright restatement effort. In a letter[8] to ALI, one of the scholars responsible for the restatement project noted that: While congressional efforts to improve the Copyright Act may be a welcome and beneficial development, it will almost certainly be a long and contentious process Register Pallante [has] not[ed] generally that 'Congress has moved slowly in the copyright space.' Reform of copyright law, in other words, and not merely restatement of it, was an important impetus for the project. As an attorney for the Copyright Office observed[9], '[a]lthough presented as a 'Restatement' of copyright law, the project would appear to be more accurately characterized as a rewriting of the law.' But 'rewriting' is a job for the legislature. And even if Congress moves slowly, or the process is frustrating, the democratic processes that produce the law should still be respected. Pyrrhic Policy Victories Attempts to change copyright or entrench liability immunity through any means possible are rational actions at an individual level, but writ large they may undermine the legal fabric of our system and should be resisted.  It's no surprise why some may be frustrated and concerned about intermediary liability and copyright issues: On the margin, it's definitely harder to operate an Internet platform if it faces sweeping liability for the actions of third parties (whether for human trafficking or infringing copyrights). Maybe copyright law needs to be reformed and perhaps intermediary liability must be maintained exactly as it is (or expanded). But the right way to arrive at these policy outcomes is not through backdoors \u2014 and it is not to begin with the assertion that such outcomes are required.  Congress and the courts can be frustrating vehicles through which to enact public policy, but they have the virtue of being relatively open to public deliberation, and of having procedural constraints that can circumscribe excesses and idiosyncratic follies. We might get bad policy from Congress. We might get bad cases from the courts. But the theory of our system is that, on net, having a frustratingly long, circumscribed, and public process will tend to weed out most of the bad ideas and impulses that would otherwise result from unconstrained decision making, even if well-intentioned. We should meet efforts like these to end-run Congress and the courts with significant skepticism. Short term policy 'victories' are likely not worth the long-run consequences. These are important, complicated issues. If we surreptitiously adopt idiosyncratic solutions to them, we risk undermining the rule of law itself.

This president has the backbone to  take the fight and he will continue to make the fight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A closer look at the key issues coming up this morning.

Rosecliff Capital CEO  Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.  And the Wall Street Journal's Assistant  Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman is here.  Great to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning.  Happy to  be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Welcome back Mike, haven't seen you in a while.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, it's been a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  I will tell you what people are asking me in  the street.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was at the doctor's office, they went, \"All the headlines are  about trade and the disruptive Trump Administration.  So why are the  markets or at least some of these gauges hitting new record highs?\"  </p><p>That's what every -- I think the -- and speaking even for myself, I think  that people who are out there working in jobs like doctors, lawyers,  farmers, they have a better understanding of what President Trump's trying  to do on trade than maybe the chattering classes, James Freeman.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The markets have definitely gotten more comfortable with his  approach.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I'll chatter on this as well.  But it is funny when you  read news headlines that they're going to have this G-7 meeting and he's  going to go fight with all of our friends in the -- among the  industrialized countries.  And yet, the markets basically saying, \"He's  going to negotiate for a while, it's all going to work out.\"  Let's see.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's not only the small and medium-sized businesses in the  country that have a lot more confidence but it's also the large  corporations that realize that this is actually going to help them and help  their bottom line and I think that's why you see the markets making new  highs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially pushing back on China since everybody gets that  knows that the country has been stealing our intellectual property.  We got  a big show this morning.  </p><p>Coming up joining the conversation, Financial Services Committee Member and  Wisconsin Congressman, Sean Duffy is with us.  Ways and Means Committee  Member, New York Congressman, Tom Reid is here, along with the Founder and  CEO of Murray Energy, Bob Murray is here.  Plus, Elevation Partners Co- Founder and Managing Director, Facebook Investor and Mentor to Mark  Zuckerberg, Roger McNamee here in the studio.  Lots to talk about with  Roger including what's going on with those valuations in technology.</p><p>Let's kick it off here though with this top story and that is preparing for  that trade fight, President Trump not backing down from his hard line  stance on trade as he prepares to meet with leaders from the G-7  industrialized nations beginning tomorrow.  It will be the first chance  world leaders have to confront the president in person since the U.S.  slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico, and the  European Union last week.</p><p>Speaking from the White House, President Trump's top Economic Advisor,  Larry Kudlow yesterday sought to down those attentions -- downplay those  attentions ahead of the summit, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  We're talking everything through.  There may be disagreements, I  regards this as much like a family quarrel.  President Trump is very clear  with respect to his trade reform efforts that we will do what is necessary  to protect the United States, its businesses and its workforce.  Trump's  trying to fix this broken system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James Freeman, what do you think?  What do you make with that?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think family quarrel is right.  This is different from  the quarrel we have with China which is less of a family.  This is -- it's  interesting.  You -- we've heard some phone calls between these leaders are  not -- is not exceptionally well.</p><p>President Macron in France saying when people asked him what he talked  about with Trump on the phone (INAUDIBLE) he said, \"Well it's kind of like  sausage you don't necessarily want to know what's in it.\"  So I think is  also going to maybe an angry bitter discussion at times.  But I'm hoping  the president ends up saying, \"Let's everybody cut our tariffs by five or  ten percent and call it a day\" and maybe they'll get some progress on that  issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think this is still negotiating, this is a negotiating?   Have you changed your position?  Initially you are not happy about the  tariffs.</p><p>FREEMAN:  No, I'm not -- I can't say I'm optimistic.  I'm saying that's my  hope.  I think best case scenario is he says, \"Let's get some tariff relief  across the board.\"  But I do think this is probably not going to go well  unless he says, \"Let's stop fighting and focus on China intellectual  property, China business rules.  How do we as a global trading society try  and enforce some kind of openness to markets in that country.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is what you've been saying for a long time, you really  want to get your allies on your team when you're fighting the Big Kahuna of  the issue and that is China and its theft.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I worry.  I think first and foremost about those American  companies, the small businesses and those workers in say industries that  need steel and aluminum, that use steel and aluminum where you have an  administration by (INAUDIBLE) is basically putting pressure and making it  difficult to do business in terms of finding your supplies, in terms of  what your costs are.  I worry about the retaliatory tariffs --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- from Canada, Mexico, and even Europe and how that's going to  hit farmers in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they're coming.  And they're coming, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And -- so I -- that's my biggest concern is something that's  done kind of -- in a half-baked way by fiat which is -- was a huge  criticism of the Obama Administration.  So I'm concerned about that.</p><p>However, I think the market is sitting back and saying, \"We are going to  wait and give this administration a little bit of time to see if they  connect\" -- why are you make --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well no.  I generally do -- I just -- I'm hoping he doesn't  misread the signal.  I think the market signal is not, \"This is good what  you're doing.\"  The market signal is we assume you're about to wrap this up  and resolve it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And --</p><p>MURPHY:  I think -- I disagree a little bit because I think if you look at  the president's statement where he says, \"If you tax -- we tax you zero to  sell your goods here.  And you tax us 25 or 50 or 100 percent to sell our  goods there, it's not fair.\"  That's not fair trade.  And I completely  agree.  So --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  And we protect some industries as well.  We have tariffs  on some products.  So obviously, everyone would like these things to go  lower.  Everyone -- I mean, global consumers, investors but --</p><p>MURPHY:  Of course the G7 aren't going to push back on this because they  don't want to -- they have a great deal and they don't want to give in on  that at all.  But I think going back to them and saying, \"Hey, let's look  at this and let's do what's fair.  If you're going to tax me 25 percent,  then I'm going to tax you 25 percent.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one thing --</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  But taxes are bad for us whether whatever another country is  doing because when we put up tariffs, we're paying more.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So whether or not they lowered their barriers and let's hope they  do, that's bad for us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, it -- trade is not so simplistic.  As Newt  Gingrich pointed out yesterday, he questions why we're taking on Canada  who's a critical ally economically, financially, politically and on the  world stage even -- so he's saying that like the production of an  automobile for example, the parts and the production --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Back and forth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- go back and forth and back and forth across the border.   Again, are we really going to get our trousers in a twist over Germany  imported cars in this country where German imports represent four percent  on all auto sales --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But unless that's more about NAFTA.  He wants a bilateral deal  with Canada -- I mean, I know he's mixing it up with the aluminum and steel  tariff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, I'm talking about Germany and then threatening -- because  of national security reasons to put a 25 percent tariff on auto import from  Japan and Europe.  I'm saying that German imported cars only represent four  percent of sales in this country, number one.  And German auto  manufacturers are a critical job source particularly in the south whether  it's Alabama or South Carolina.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's still completely outsized.  I mean, if we're get -- if  we're paying 25 percent going into Europe and then we're charging them 2.5  percent, that's really outsized and that's a major difference even though  that the volume is smaller.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  But is it -- the volume is smaller but these are also  critical employers in this country and we already -- again, it doesn't  benefit the United States on the -- they're going to make a national  security argument on automobiles, that's absurd.  That's what they --  they're studying that at the Commerce Department right now.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  I think free and fair trade is what we're looking for.  So I  don't have the exact numbers --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- but if it's 2.5 I'm getting, you're getting 25, like I don't  see that as fair, you know.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Well that's his point.  Let's turn to North Korea  because the summit is back on, the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani now  says the U.S. has the upper-hand, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP LAWYER:  (INAUDIBLE) they're going to --  they got the nuclear war against us.  They were -- they were going to  defeat us in a nuclear war.  We said we'll work on the summit under those  circumstances.  Well Kim Jong-un got back on his hands and knees and beg  for it, which is exactly the position you want to put him in.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Japan pressing the U.S. to stick to a hard line on North Korea.   Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to meet with the president today at the  White House ahead of Tuesday's summit.  </p><p>Do you think these kinds of comments from Rudy Giuliani, Dagen, are  productive heading into Tuesday?  What's your take on Rudy Giuliani here?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That -- maybe not that comment.  Ultimately this summit coming  in to Tuesday, the part -- we will walk away just knowing whether North  Korea is serious or not.  I think that that's the best that we can hope  for.  Don't set the bar too high, we go in and know if negotiations are  worth pursuing with that nation.</p><p>I quite -- I don't quite get the Rudy Giuliani strategy to be blunt,  whether he's talking about the president's power to pardon himself or this.   Again, there's only one President Trump and I think you have to be careful.   People think that they can speak like him and think that they can use the  same bombast that the president can --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's a good point actually, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and I don't think that works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Giuliani says Kim Jong-un begged for the summit on his hands  and knees.</p><p>MURPHY:  He kind of wants --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- I think someone to maybe be more warm and fuzzy versus, you  know, you have the president the way he is.  You know, you'd think that  maybe the people around him could kind of soothe things or calm things but  maybe not the case.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well if he's on his knees begging, where are the confessions?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where are the confessions.  Where's denuclearization at this  point?  All right.  The Justice Department's internal watchdog, the inter - - the I.G. reportedly concluding that Jim Comey defied authority at times  during his tenure as FBI Director.</p><p>According to ABC News, a draft of the inspector general's report  specifically uses the word insubordinate to describe Comey's behavior.  It  criticizes former Attorney General Loretta Lynch as well for her handling  of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation.  Your thoughts as we await  this I.G. report.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, again, I can't wait to see it because --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, we kind of know he defied authority.  So I'm going  to -- you're going to sit down and read it but we know that he -- that he  did -- when he got for that microphone to basically lambast Hillary Clinton  but then announced there are going to be no charges.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And this is kind of the virtue of this.  I think it remind --  well at a minimum, there's probably a lot of new investigative research we  haven't seen.  But at a minimum, it's going to remind people that before he  became a hero of the anti-Trump movement and a bestselling author, there  was unanimity among senior former officials, democrats, republicans that  this guy had broken the protocol of the FBI, had taken on a prosecutor's  role that he didn't deserve, that was not his job.</p><p>Had made all kinds of decisions that really trashed the traditional due  process practiced by the FBI, so this may be a reminder.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He made a decision to be judged, jury, and executor at the same  time.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's what -- here's what -- I have raised this privately and  publicly with people outside this administration and inside.  Who told  President Trump it was a good idea to keep that big old boy scout on as the  FBI director?  If you break -- when Obama was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He should have fired him right after the inauguration.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When Obama was -- appointed Jim Comey to run the FBI, the Wall  Street Journal wrote an editorial saying, \"Don't do it and here are the  million reasons why\" and I don't know who gave the president the advice  because, again, that's why we have a special counsel because of Comey,  because of his firing and boom, now you got Bob Mueller.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to see what is said about Loretta Lynch in this  I.G. report given the fact that we know that she told Comey to call it a  matter instead of a criminal investigation which it was.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the meeting on the Tarmac with President Clinton.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  All right, we got all that coming up this  morning.  Meanwhile, we'll take a break.  When we come back, devastation in  Guatemala to show you.  This stunning images from the volcanic damage are  released as children burned by eruptions come to America for treatment.   Really an incredible story, we have the very latest.</p><p>And then Twitter is flying high, the social media giant looks to take  advantage of its high stock price by selling a billion dollars in  convertible bonds, we'll tell you about that next, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Children burned by Guatemala's deadly volcano  being sent to United States for treatment now.  Cheryl Casone with a lot  more here, Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes Maria.  So at least six children are going to be arriving at  Shriners Hospital in Galveston, Texas.  And at least 99 people now dead.   The frantic search for survivors is continuing there, nearly 200 people are  still missing.</p><p>The volcano of fire erupting several times this week, spreading a blanket  of ash.  Here is a luxurious hotel before and after the eruptions, now  completely gray as you can see on your screen.  And complete villages have  been smothered the ash after the -- by the ash after the active volcano's  biggest eruption in four decades.</p><p>Well another headline we're watching, Twitter joining other big technology  companies in selling debt in the form of convertible bond.  The company  plans to sell $1 billion of bonds that converts to stock cash or a  combination of both.  Twitter taking that step as its stock hits a three- year high ahead of its move into the S&amp;P500, that is today.  Twitter shares  have been on a bit of a tear soaring 65 percent this year.</p><p>Well, country music's biggest stars and their fans coming together in  national for the annual CMT Awards last night.  This, of course, is a fan- voted award show for country music videos and also TV performances.   Kicking off the night, hosts Little Big Town performed a hilarious  (INAUDIBLE) of the royal wedding, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Look who has appeared in the procession, is that the  queen?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I believe it is.  </p><p>DARIUS RUCKER, SINGER:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE, SINGER:  Oh, the (INAUDIBLE) pilot.  </p><p>FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE, SINGER:  Yes.  But I feel a little bit (INAUDIBLE)  indeed and I like it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that was Darius Rucker dressed up as the queen and then  Florida Georgia Line playing Prince Charles and Prince Harry with pretty  good accents by the way.  </p><p>OK, Carrie Underwood proved that she is still the queen of country with an  incredible performance of her newest hit, \"Cry Pretty.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARRIE UNDERWOOD, COUNTRY SINGER:  You just got to face that you can't cry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Underwood went on to make CMT history with her 18th win claiming  best female video for her collaboration with Ludacris on the song \"The  Champion.\"  But it was Blake Shelton who took home the night's highest  honor video of the year for his song \"I'll name the dogs\" for which he also  won best male video.</p><p>Shelton said he couldn't believe he was nominated in the category with such  talented newer artists.  Blake getting a little gray Maria but still --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's still great.</p><p>CASONE:  -- he's still great.  People love him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, he's still great.  I can see --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As I was --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was on -- motoring things under my breath like Yosemite Sam.   Carrie Underwood has never been and will never be the queen of country  music.  Loretta Lynn is the queen of country music.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dolly Parton, if you want to go back, Patsy Cline.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tammy Wynette.  I don't care, it will never be Carrie Underwood.   God bless her and I mean that from the heart, she's a great singer but she  ain't the queen of country music and Blake Shelton ain't even a country  singer.  I'll leave it at that. </p><p>FREEMAN:  Now you're really -- now you're really getting nasty saying he's  not country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm a big fan.  I'm a fan.  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I know not to say anything here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He is not country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to zip it at this point.</p><p>MURPHY:  I'll say nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, startling  life over again with the help of Kim Kardashian, Alice Maria Johnson now  free after nearly 22 years in prison after President Trump commutes her  sentence.  Details ahead on the president's decision.</p><p>And then comedian Samantha Bee apologizing again for her vulgar comments  about Ivanka Trump but she still gets to dig in aimed in her critics, back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A warning from tough leaders in corporate  America, J.P. Morgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon and Berkshire Hathaway  Chairman Warren Buffett writing an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal with  the headlines, \"Short-termism is Harming the Economy.\"  And if they argue  for companies to reduce or eliminate providing quarterly earnings guidance.</p><p>Joining us now to talk more about that, is Health and Capital Management  Chief Strategist Bank Analyst, Dick Bove.  Dick, good to see you thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>DICK BOVE, STRATEGIC BANK ANALYST, HEALTH AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Thank  you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  I mean obviously the short-termism with the  quarterly guidance and what's going to happen in the next three months does  create a lot of trading in the stocks.  Are you for this less information?</p><p>BOVE:  Well yes.  No, I think this information is critical and it should be  revealed.  But I don't think we're dealing with short-termism when we took  a look at local banks in the current time.  In other words, if you want to  pick one industry that has benefited most by what President Trump has done,  it's hard -- it's going to be hard for it to find something better than  midcap banks.</p><p>You know, we're talking about loans in the United States growing three to  four percent.  If you look at the midcap banks, loans are growing at 12 to  15 percent.  We're talking about six to eight percent growth in the big  bank earnings.  If we're looking at the midcap banks, we're talking about,  you know, growth somewhere which is two to two and a half times that  amount.  </p><p>And if we're looking at trying to make money in stocks, OK, which I think  is what we're all about, there are 40 -- there are 40 midcap banks which  are up over 20 percent this year.  There are, you know, something like 80  that are up over 15 percent and 150 that are up over 10 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BOVE:  So, you know, all of -- all of the things that the president have  done -- has done and what the regulators are doing is going to bonanza for  these midcap banks and these stocks are flying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The roll -- the rollback in regulations has been very  positive and impactful.  But just to be clear, would you favor these  companies giving up reporting quarterly guidance which is what we led into  the segment with as J.P. Morgan CEO and Berkshire's chairman are writing in  the Op-Ed in the Journal today.</p><p>BOVE:  No, not at all.  I think that this com --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't like it.  You don't like the idea.</p><p>BOVE:  No.  The -- well these companies have enough patience to tell the  owners what's going on the companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Every three months, yes.</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  And even, you know, in shorter periods to conferences and  other methods of communicating with their stockholders.  They don't own the  company, the stockholders own the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BOVE:  And the stockholders are entitled to information --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So there you go.</p><p>BOVE:  -- and for them to say they don't want to give it, it's not right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you want to hear that every three months because, James,  you know, the issue of course is whether or not it creates short-termism.   But go ahead, you had another question.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I'm just wondering about you mentioned why this is better  for midcaps now, some reg relief, regulatory relief coming from the  administration, does this mean some of these mega bags really ought to be  shrinking, ought to be breaking themselves up getting into that less  regulated zone?</p><p>BOVE:  Well the fact of the matter is that they are not competing  effectively with the midcap banks.  And it isn't the easing in regulation  that I'm talking about.  What I'm talking about is the president has  created an environment in which small companies and medium-sized companies  are now borrowing money and they're borrowing money from these midcap  banks.</p><p>When you talk about 12 to 15 percent in loan growth, that's where the  strength is coming from.  That's why the earnings are going up, and that's  why the stock prices are going up.  That's not short-termism, that's not  easing in regulation, that's strength coming and bubbling up from the  bottom of the economy which is if you will pushing these banks up.   Remember, this is a totally domestic industry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BOVE:  These companies get all their funding from Americans, they give all  their money in loans to Americans, they don't have to worry about tariffs,  they don't have to worry about a whole bunch of these, you know, Italian  banks or, you know, what's going on in Venezuela.  All they have to look at  is what's going on in the United States and what's going on in the United  States is just terrific.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good story right now, Mike Murphy.</p><p>MURPHY:  Hey Dick, it's Mike Murphy.  So the large cap banks haven't moved  anywhere near as much as the midcap banks have.  But it seems like now that  regulations are helping the large caps also, you might start to see some  M&amp;A activity.  Are there any names in the midcap level that you think are  right for the picking from the J.P. Morgans of the World?</p><p>BOVE:  Well J.P. Morgan will not be allowed to make acquisitions.  In other  words, we have not yet figured out that we do need big banks.  </p><p>You know, when we talk about sanctions of this country and sanctions of  that country, we're talking about the banking industry globally, right?   And to shrink the banking industry in the United States in attempt to them  to put sanctions on Iran or in North Korea or whomever is just crazy.  We  need very big banks.  But if you want to make the most money, investing in  banks you've got to go where the loan growth is the fastest and that is not  the big banks, that is -- that is the midsized banks that are dealing with,  you know, the U.S. economy at the middle level.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BOVE:  And that's where you're making your money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well just to be clear, Mike was asking about acquisitions and  whether or not we're going to see deals for the midcap sector and whether  or not the larger banks as the acquirers.  You're saying, they're at their  limit, they're not going to be able to acquire much more the larger banks  but do you expect M&amp;A in the midcap sector?  Real quick, Dick.</p><p>BOVE:  Yes, it's going to be explosive.  There's going to be more  acquisitions the next 12 months in the midcap banks thank you've seen over  the last few years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go, there's the answer to your question.  Dick, good  to see you sir.  Thanks so much.</p><p>BOVE:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dick Bove joining us there.  Coming up, a record setting month  for border arrest, it is the third month in a row that more than 50,000  illegal immigrants have been rounded up.  The president is not exactly  happy with these numbers, we will explain.</p><p>And then lights out, Red Sox fans causing a delay in the game when they  used their cellphones to distract the opposing team, the low lights coming  up, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning, everybody, welcome back.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, June 7th, your  top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  Markets are looking at  a mixed opening this morning, Dow Industrials up 40 points, S&amp;P 500 also up  a fraction, but the NASDAQ is now negative by a fraction.  This after the  NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 closed at all-time highs yesterday, again.  The  Dow and the S&amp;P 500 finished at the highest levels in three months.  Take a  look at the numbers yesterday, big rally.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed performances to report, it was a rough start  for London, trading on the London stock exchange was delayed, this morning,  due to a technical issue.  Now, the FT 100 is down eight points.  The CAC  Quarante and the DAX Index are up, fractionally.  In Asia overnight,  markets finished mostly higher, with the exception of China.  Shanghai  composite down a fraction, but the best performer was in Japan and Hong  Kong, up almost one percent.</p><p>Securing the Southern Border, a startling new report says illegal border  crossings hit 50,000 in the month of May.  There's still a battle on  Capitol Hill over immigration policy and the outlook, well, is not looking  good.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  Can't see us going  back to immigration issue, unless there were proposal that the President  actually was OK with and said he was willing to sign.  I don't think he's  OK with anything that I've seen coming our way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We take a closer look, straight ahead, this morning.  Sorry not  sorry, Samantha Bee returning to her show after her vulgar comments about  Ivanka Trump.  She apologized to her but she also lashed out at her  critics, taking one more dig there.  Carl Icahn, eyeing a drug maker, the  activist investor reportedly taking mistaken Allergan, a look at the  changes he wants to make at Allergan, coming up.  </p><p>Plus, fans causing some problems at Fenway yesterday, they forced a delay,  trying to distract players with their cell phone lights.  Then, the Iceman  Cometh's Val kilmer says he's returning as Tom Cruise's rival in the sequel  to Top Gun, all those stories coming up.  But first, this top story this  half an hour, make or break time for House Republicans on immigration as  the GOP conference sets a -- get sets to debate the issue later today.  </p><p>There are sharp divisions within the group on how to proceed with this  issue.  Some of the Republicans would like to solve before November's  crucial midterm elections.  Here now is National Border Patrol Council  President, Brandon Judd, Brandon, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us what you're seeing at the border, what should happen on  this issue of immigration based on what you see?</p><p>JUDD:  Well, if you look at it, I'm a lot more optimistic than Senator  McConnell.  I do believe that there are certain House Representatives such  as McCall, McSally and Goodlatte who are going to put something together  that the President is going to be willing to take a hard look at it.  </p><p>What the President wants is he wants us to address border security once and  for all, to finally secure the border, so that the American public doesn't  have to worry about what's coming across the border, the drugs that are  coming across the border, the people from the Middle East, potential  terrorists and all of those different things that are coming across the  border.  And if we can address that, I definitely think the President will  take a hard look at it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we just reported that 50,000 people crossed, this is the  latest numbers we have, can you tell us these were the arrests just for the  month of May, can you tell us what you see in terms of characterizing the  situation today, is really what I ask?</p><p>JUDD:  Yes, certainly. If you look at -- if you look at what we had in  April 2017, President Trump with simple rhetoric alone by himself, he  caused a drop to 45-year lows.  The problem was within our agency, we have  too many Obama holdovers that gave us those policies that didn't secure the  border, and those people are still running our agency today.  </p><p>They did not give us any operations.  Any policy changes that would help  build on that momentum that President Trump single-handily gave us.  And  until we address that issue, we are going to continue to see operations  fail and that's going to cause illegal immigration to continue to climb.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Brandon, hi, James Freeman here at the Wall Street Journal, I  know you follow the politics in this pretty closely.  I think it's  confusing for a lot of people because it seemed like you have had, kind of,  this obvious deal where the President gets his wall and people who want  more legal immigration, get an answer on both high-skill and low-skill  labor, the so-called Dreamers, get a chance to remain productive members of  our society.  Why hasn't this happened, is there a deal to be had here?</p><p>JUDD:  I think there is a deal to be had but I think that the main reason  that it hasn't happened, is the Democrats do not want to give the President  any sort of a win, anything that makes him look good, makes it more  difficult for them in midterm elections, it makes it more difficult for  them going into 2020.  And so they are going to try to stop anything that  is going to give a positive outlook on something that this President does.  </p><p>And frankly, that from a border patrol agent standpoint, from somebody who  puts on a uniform and goes out and patrols the border, that's disappointing  because we want to see people come together, we want to see people act in a  fashion that the American public wants them to do.  We can address the  Dreamers and we can address border security, but we have to do both.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Brandon, it's Dagen McDowell, why not more outrage and anger at  the Republicans, though, who in omnibus spending bill, did not fund new  wall construction and did not put any restrictions with the power or the  purse, in terms of funding on sanctuary cities, that don't those  Republicans and the leadership there deserve your ire more than anybody?</p><p>JUDD:  They do deserve ire.  In fact, I'm very disappointed that the  Republicans haven't stepped forward to close the loopholes that allow the  people to cross the border, legally claim asylum, then get led into the  United States, with the hearing date sometime two years down the road and  they never show up.  They had -- they had the opportunity to seize upon the  momentum that the President gave them.  There should be ire on both sides  of the aisle.  </p><p>But let's be honest with the omnibus, they couldn't have gotten any, sort  of, a bill passed if they would have tried to fund the walls.  The  Democrats were blocking that, they weren't going to allow it to happen.  So  there is ire on both sides but we can't use the omnibus and point to that  and say that's the Republicans' fault, they couldn't have gotten it done,  it wouldn't have been impossible.</p><p>MURPHY:  Brandon, it's Mike Murphy.  Seems to me that, kind of, the simple  compromise here is that you get the wall funded and you get the wall being  built, but then you also deal with the Dreamers who are here and give them  a right to stay here.  Is that just oversimplifying the issue too much or  is that something that you think could happen?</p><p>JUDD:  No, that's not oversimplifying and, in fact, that's exactly what  needs to happen.  But again, you have to look at history and we have to use  history as a guide.  If you look back at the Immigration Reform and Control  Act of 1986, they promised border security measures, they didn't give us  the border security measures, they gave us mass amnesty, but they didn't  give us the border security measures that were necessary for us not to be  back in this situation.  </p><p>They promised us back in '86 that we wouldn't -- that they would secure the  border once and for all, and we wouldn't have to deal with an amnesty  again.  They didn't do that.  And so, what you're looking at, is you're  looking at the lawmakers saying, OK, look, if we want to have any sort of  Dreamers or any sort of amnesty, if you will, we have to secure the border  first.  </p><p>And so they are putting the border security, first, and then the amnesty,  second.  So if the Democrats will give the Republicans the border security  measures, then the Republicans will give them that amnesty.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the House passed that bill that would provide $50 million  in funding to fight MS-13.  How important is that money?  Where is it  needed?  I mean, the questions become, is the money reaching the places  that it's intended?</p><p>JUDD:  Well, I mean, we don't know whether the money is going reach the  places intended as of yet, but I am hopeful that it will.  If you look at  this money, we've got to -- we've got to put it on the border but we also  have to put it within the United States as well.  Those -- these MS-13  people, they're already -- these gang members are already here, they are  brutally dangerous.  </p><p>They murder, they rape, all you have to do is look at their motto and say,  this is a problem and we must address this problem.  It's got to be  addressed on the border.  It's got to be addressed in our -- in our cities  as we currently have it.  And so, that money has got to be distributed in  different ways, whether it gets to where it needs to go, that remains to be  seen, but I am optimistic under this administration.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I know we are short of time here, so just real quick, is this an  issue that gets resolved in 2018, 2019 or never in terms of a deal that has  border security and allows more legal immigration?</p><p>JUDD:  I would never bet against this President as far as what he's already  been able to accomplish in such a short time.  This is one of his main  priorities, and I think that he does, in fact, get it done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Brandon, it's good to have  you on the program, thanks so much.</p><p>JUDD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brandon Judd, joining us there.  Coming up, billionaire  investor Carl Icahn, reportedly buying a small stake in the drug maker,  Allergan.  How this will impact the company as it faces pressure from other  activists investors as well.  Then, an angry apology, comedian Samantha Bee  saying sorry for her vulgar comments about Ivanka Trump, but also taking  aim at her critics, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, billionaire investor, Carl Icahn, acquiring a  stake in Allergan.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  Carl Icahn has bought a small stake in  Allergan.  The drug maker is under pressure from activist shareholders.   The size of his investment, not disclosed but Icahn has been a long-time  supporter of Allergan CEO, Brenton Saunders.  Earlier this week, some  investment firms urged Allergan not to pursue large acquisitions.  Shares  of the drug maker down about seven percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Alice Mary Johnson is now a free woman.  President Trump commuting  life sentence after she spent 21 years behind bar for nonviolent drug and  money laundering charges.  The grandmother, running into the arms of family  and friends, as you can see here.  Her release coming after Kim Kardashian- West lobbied President Trump to get her released.  This picture is from  last week.  </p><p>OK, remember this vulgar comment, Comedian, Samantha Bee, her --  president's daughter last week?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAMANTHA BEE, COMEDIAN:  One mother to another, do something about your  dad's immigration practices, you feckless (BLEEP).  He listens to you.  </p><p>(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) </p><p>BEE:  Put on something tight and low cut and tell your father to (BLEEP)  stop it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, she returned to her show on TBS' \"Full Frontal\" and  apologized on air for that comment again.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEE:  A lot of people were offended and angry that I used to describe the  president's daughter and advise her last week.  It is a word I have used on  the show many times hoping to go reclaim it, this time I used it as an  insult.  I crossed the line.  I regret it.  And I do apologize for that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>CASONE:  Well, many people were upset about the fact that Roseanne Barr  show, \"Roseanne\", was canceled over her offensive comments.  Meanwhile,  Samantha Bee gets to keep her show on TBS.  Although, TBS is, we should  say, going to have more closely monitoring of her show in general. </p><p>OK.  Now, to this: Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer are reuniting in \"Top Gun 2\",  guess the (INAUDIBLE).  Kilmer's going to reprise his role as Iceman.  The  rival, of course, to Tom Cruise's maverick.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are still dangerous.  You can be my wingman any  time.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  OK.  The original \"Top Gun\" grossed nearly $357 million worldwide  and that was in the 80s folks, OK, let's just give that some context.  The  sequel takes off next summer.  OK, Maria, my favorite guy was Iceman in the  movie, in the original \"Top Gun\".  I admit it.  We'll see what Val Kilmer  looks like in this new one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.  It's been a while.</p><p>CASONE:  I don't know.  He looks a little different now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He does.  He looks a lot different.  I'm sure Dagen has  something to say about that.  Because he looks a lot different.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is he going to have a stand-in?  Did he have a full tip to toe  body transplant because he does not look -- Tom Cruise -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe he'll get into shape for the film.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Tom Cruise has held it together, man.  Tom Cruise looks good.   He's been keeping on top of that, shall we say.  We've always go after  women for, like, nips and tucks, and working on our faces.  Tom Cruise has  been seeing some doctors, I think it's pretty clear.  He looks good though.  </p><p>MURPHY:  \"Top Gun\" should've been the lead story; that's big news.  We're  watching it from the 80s.  I think that's big news.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let us know if you're going to go see it.  Send us a tweet.   Coming up, Philadelphia Eagles Safety, Malcolm Jenkins explains why he did  not want to attend the White House Super Bowl celebration but he does it  without saying a word.  We will show you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, Red Sox fans causing chaos.  But first, we begin  with the NBA finals: Golden State up three games to none now.  Jared Max,  with the story.</p><p>MAX:  Maria, it is possible that tomorrow night will be the last game  Lebron James plays with his home state Cleveland Cavaliers.  If this is the  end, he's going out with a bang.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  A tremendous God-given ability.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Does that count as an assist and a basket?  Triple-doubled.  33  points, 11 assist, 10 rebounds.  Cavs led by 13.  But if you turned off the  game about the half time, you missed it all.  Kevin Durant, who scored 24  in the first-half, kept going in the second.  Durant outscored the rest of  the Warriors starters, 43-41.  The game featured 11 ties, 13 lead changes,  but Durant dominated as the warriors outscored the Cavs in the second-half,  58-44.  This late by three by Durant put the game away, final 110-102.  No  team has ever comeback to win at NBA Playoff Series that trailed 3-0.  </p><p>Philadelphia Eagles' Head Coach, Doug Peterson, addressed this week's  biggest news story: his team's disinvite to the White House by President  Trump.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DOUG PETERSON, HEAD COACH, PHILADELPHIA EAGLES:  I was looking forward to  going down and being recognized as world champions and, you know, it is  what it is.  We're here today, got an OTA practice.  I'm focused on these  the next couple of days, getting through next week and onto training camp.   So, that's where we're at.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  Peterson was mostly tight-lipped and anthem (INAUDIBLE) or Malcolm  Jenkins on the Eagles was silent.  He had a different approach with  reporters.  He held up signs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Are you surprised that you guys are involved in this  controversy with the White House?  Are you not going say anything today or  just going to use these posters?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  You're not listening with the one side and other numbers about social  injustice and others.  If the Washington Capitals win game five at the  Stanley Cup final tonight, will they go to the White House to celebrate the  first title in team history?  Devante Smith-Pelly who's Canadian-born --  one of two black players on the team, said the team hasn't discussed it but  his mind likely made up, not going.  </p><p>Hey, isn't this next image pretty from Fenway Park?  Take a look at this  last night at the Boston Red Sox game.  The problem is, they're not at a  Paul McCartney concert singing \"Hey Jude\".  They're blinding the Tigers'  batters.  Boston's 7-1-win last night briefly delayed because of it.   Tigers skipped a run.  Gordon (INAUDIBLE) says the fans are just having  fun, I get it.  But when it's in that center field, my hitters are looking  right into it.  It's very dangerous.  </p><p>Oh, and the T.V. broadcast cruise might turn away the cameras from fans who  run on the field, but hey, we're in the right place if you want to watch  (INAUDIBLE) get tackled by a security.  If you're a security guard, this  is, like, the moment you dream of: of hitting a home run in the world  series.  They finally get the guy down and suffice to say, he probably was  not in comfort setting for sleep last night.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you said that's what he wanted?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I mean, as a security guard, this is like a dream moment, you  know.  If some idiot runs out on the field; he's had too much to drink  likely, I'm guessing, and then you get to take him down.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So, are they (INAUDIBLE) and wild?  Are fans not allowed to use  the cell phones?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, for the lights holding them up, obviously, and I know this  seems like just kind of a fun little story, it looks pretty, but it's not  half-time of the Super Bowl and it's not a concert.  And the lights being  shied, yes, I mean, if you're fluorescent -- you know -- </p><p>MURPHY:  You can even identify a mile an hour fast ball --</p><p>MAX:  Exactly.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- in your eye.  It could be. </p><p>FREEMAN:  I know, but this is not in the rules of baseball, is it?  I mean,  I'm thinking people sometimes wear white t-shirts in center field bleachers  to mess with the batter, right?  </p><p>MAX:  I think Commissioner Rob Manfred should calm down on this.  I know  it's fun, calm down it immediately.  Stop it, so it doesn't happen in other  sports.  This is like the idiots who shine the lasers at the pilots.  Stop  it.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, on LeBron's dunk, he got the basket, and assist, and a rebound  too, don't forget.</p><p>MAX:  All three.  A triple-double.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's that.  Good game.  Jared, thank you.  All  right, Jared, Max.  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7  or in Sirius Radio XM 115.  Still ahead, Mark Zuckerberg, could be back on  the hot seat on Capitol Hill to talk about Facebook's ties to Chinese phone  maker, Huawei, on one-on-one with Zuckerberg's mentor, Roger McNamee for  his take next hour right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Whenever you go in a pizza joint you  always want to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, very good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She can -- this is Maria Bartiromo's wheelhouse  that you just entered.  She can toss dough in the air.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We've seen this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Has this been a segment on the show, yet or -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did a segment on \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" with my sister when we  made my father's pizza.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We need to do that again, for sure.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it could be an annual -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More than annual. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to send a camera crew to your house, like when  you're with your family, making pizza.  It would be awesome.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll show you how to make pizza.</p><p>Look, we've got to get into the story about Iran.  You mentioned it earlier  and what went on in the Obama administration -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of allowing Iran to have access to the U.S.  financial system.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the President had said as part of his terrible nuclear  deal, don't worry -- he said this to Congress -- I'm not going to let the  Iranians into the U.S. banking system.  That's one sanction I'm not going  to remove.</p><p>Well, they figure out that if they want to give Iran access to billions of  dollars, that Iran wanted it in dollars and then to convert that to euros.   So they decided secretly to issue a license allowing Iran to transact in  the U.S. banking system.</p><p>Well, the plan failed because U.S. banks would not participate.  And I know  over the last decade especially, people have really beaten up on the big  banks.  I've been among those people.  And I think this is a time where  you've got to say hats off to bankers for -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two major banks said no, we're not doing it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And good for them to say no, we're not going to participate  in this secret deal to fund the Ayatollah.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I remember right after the Iranian nuclear deal was inked,  because of the sanctions on U.S. banks, John Kerry took a trip to I think  it was London and met with all these banking heads and all these executives  in the financial system and was trying to encourage them to do business  with Iran -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which would have been illegal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally said we've got restrictions on U.S. banks but you  guys, you can go ahead and start transacting business with Iran because  they were so desperate for the deal to work and for money to get funneled.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  The banks had regulators they had to answer to -- that's why  they couldn't do it when the President -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they knew -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The banks were afraid of breaking the law.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think we ought to give more credit -- I don't think it  was just compliance.  I think they made the right decision and they  realized the customers wouldn't like this either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a big story.  We're going to talk about this about  coming.</p><p>We've got Financial Services Committee member and Wisconsin Congressman  Sean Duffy coming up so we will ask him about that along with Ways and  Means Committee member and New York Congressman Tom Reed.  We'll see what  they think about this whole Iran situation.</p><p>Plus, Murray Energy founder and president and CEO Bob Murray has a thing or  two to say about trade and tariff as well.</p><p>So stay with us on all of that coming up.  Big hour coming up.</p><p>But first this top story and that is trade tensions.  President Trump  meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today ahead of the G-7  meeting and the President's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway is live at the White House this morning with more.   Doug -- good morning to you.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>And this marks about the start of the President's busiest week since he  assumed office.  It begins this afternoon with the visit of Japanese  President Shinzo Abe who arrives here at 12:00 noon.  The two men are  planning for a joint press conference at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>They have hit it all very well as you well know.  Shinzo Abe was the first  foreign leader to visit the Trump Tower during the transition, later  invited to Mar-A-Lago where the two men enjoyed golf.  They seemed to have  hit it off very, very well.</p><p>No country has a greater interest in reining in North Korea's nuclear  capability than Japan.  That country is truly facing an existential threat  from Kim Jong-un's ballistic missiles.  His meeting with Trump today points  out that the upcoming summit in Singapore is not really a bilateral  meeting, although it is that by name, but that the interest of many  countries -- Japan, South Korea, China, the Pacific Rim countries and many  others -- all have a very important stake in this.</p><p>Complicating the preparations for the summit is the G-7 meeting in Quebec  tomorrow which the President will attend.  It comes amid heated debate over  President Trump's pursuit of more tariffs against Canada, against Mexico,  against the European Union and the President's ban against the Japanese --  excuse me, the Chinese phone company ZTE which has been accused of evading  the ban on sanctions against Iran and North Korea.</p><p>Larry Kudlow was asked about whether there's been a consideration of  lifting the ban on ZTE yesterday.  Here's what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  No decisions on both sides as of now.  And of course, I refer you  to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce.  But as of this moment, no  decision has been reached by both sides.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Trump leaves for the G-7 summit tomorrow.  From there he will  jet off to Singapore where so much is at stake, so much is unknown, and so  many countries are awaiting eagerly to find out what happens and whether  there will be subsequent meetings at all.  </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  And we check back as news develops.  Doug -- thank  you.  Doug McKelway there -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at the White House this morning.</p><p>Facebook fallout -- Senator Ed Markey is calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to  testify before Cngress again following backlash over the social media  company's data partnership with Chinese phone maker Huawei.</p><p>Yesterday, the Senator tweeted this, \"For more than 10 years Facebook has  shared users' personal data with Chinese companies including one with close  ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  I'm calling for Mark Zuckerberg to  come to the Senate and explain how U.S. national security was not  jeopardized.\"</p><p>Here's a look back to what Zuckerberg said during his testimony on the hill  back in April.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook.  I run it.  And I'm responsible for what  happens here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg,  early investor in Facebook certainly, and managing director and co-founder  of Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee here with us.  Roger -- great to see  you.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Always  great to be here -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. </p><p>So you've previously voiced your concerns over Facebook and the business  model.  How do you feel about the response from Facebook?  Where are we now  on this issue?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We're nowhere near the end, unfortunately.  The company had this  model for years called \"move fast and break things\".  The notion was don't  let anything get in the way of growth.</p><p>The reality is it was really \"move fast, break things, apologize and then  move on\" as though nothing has happened.  And that's really where Mark is  now.  He's apologizing because every rock we turn over has another scandal  hidden underneath it.</p><p>And this one in China, we don't know exactly how bad it is.  What we know,  though, is that Facebook was not monitoring these companies.  And if the  Defense Department is telling us they won't buy Huawei products because  they're afraid of bugging and hacking, I think we have to be concerned that  Huawei with 10 years or whatever of control of Facebook user accounts is  going to have had the opportunity to download all that data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is one of the biggest stories of our time,  frankly.  When you look at China and what has occurred and the fact that  there's this massive technology transfer going on, where China acquires  American companies, forces the transfer of technology and then you see  Facebook, it's not the technology or secrets but it's all their user data.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And Mark has worked so hard to try to get in the good graces of  the Chinese government in order to have the opportunity to participate  there -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the thing though, yes.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  -- and so I do not find their response even remotely comforting,  because their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the  bare minimum when they're forced to.  And the situation here is they  weren't paying attention.  They have no idea what these guys did and they  had years to mess with this data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And there are other technology companies that wanted a  foothold in China but would not adhere to China rules, in terms of forcing  the technology.  Look at Google.</p><p>By the way, Google now reportedly bracing for a fine of up to $11 billion  following an anti-trust issue in the European Union.  That of course,  investigation into the company according to the \"Financial Times\" is coming  to a head.  This would be the second major penalty for Google coming from  the European competition regulators.</p><p>What's going on in terms of regulation within tech?  We're just at the  beginning of this.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We are.  And it's really important that we have some threat of  regulation because the companies have done a terrible job of self- regulation.  I mean, they have been given all the room in the world to  manage themselves and yet we've clearly seen one disaster after another.</p><p>And the issues that Google faces in Europe are not unique to Google.   Amazon has competitive issues in many markets around the world.  Facebook  is clearly behaving like a monopolist around the world.  And as a  consequence, regulators I think are appropriately worried that the  entrepreneurial economy, especially in this country, is being stifled.</p><p>These guys are blocking the new startups from getting going.  They're  really limiting the rate of innovation in this country.  And that's not the  American way.  The American way is we let a thousand flowers bloom.  We let  entrepreneur create new things.</p><p>And these guys can be really successful without blocking every new thing  that comes along.  And it's important for regulators to make that point and  find ways to constrain them so that we can have this kind of economy that  really supports jobs all across America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are there other companies out there that are also selling the  data right now that we don't even know about?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I assume so.  In fact, I think you have to assume that whatever  data you had that was in one of these systems has been compromised  somewhere.  The only company that has made a strategy of protecting your  data is Apple and even there I don't think you can feel 100 percent safe.   But you're going to feel much safer there.</p><p>The worst offenders on this have been the Android operating system that  Google owns and Facebook.  Both of which have been so porous that frankly,  you just have to assume everything has been compromised.</p><p>And so that's why when regulators look at this, the important thing to look  at is to protect users from inappropriate usage of their data going forward  -- there's no way to get the data back.  So what you have to do is place  restrictions on how it's used.  We have to be given control over what any  company does with the data that they have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's that.  There's also the issue of conservative ideas  being crushed, being, you know, eliminated.  So we had Kevin McCarthy on  the show recently, the majority leader, he said that.  That, you know,  these companies are editing the information that we all see.  We had Devin  Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee Sunday who said the same thing.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  There's no question that they edit like crazy.  But I think the  perception they edit one side more than the other is not actually correct.   I think what's going on is that these companies are not transparent.  We  have no idea what they're doing when they edit.</p><p>I think in reality, what they're doing is creating what is known as a  filter bubble around each person.  They give each person what that person  wants and their idea of what that person wants may or may not be correct.   But their notion is they give you your preferences all the time and  reinforce that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you saw the story last week where if you typed in GOP in  California, you pulled up a list of ideologies on Google and one of them  was Nazism.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  No, no, no.  That kind of stuff is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How does that happen -- Roger?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  The answer is this stuff is totally automated and these people  have no idea, right.  They're trying to sell ads.  They're not worried  about truth.  They're not worried about fact.  They're worried about  engagement.  They're worried about their revenue.  They want to give you  what they think you want.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now they can be worried -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  They obviously thought somebody wanted to know the party  sentiment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now they're going to have to worry about regulation.  I mean  Devin Nunes said look -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  They should have to worry about regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if somebody doesn't come in the free market and do what  Google does and make sure to promise us that they're not going to be  editing things like this, then it's fine.  If not, we're going to have to  look at this as if they're monopolies.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  You have to look that way.  Now, I think it's about time people  started to look at them that way.  The right answer in the short run is to  force them to have a button at the top that gives you a choice of view.   You can give me what you think I want.  But I want to be able to see an  unfiltered view as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick -- would you put money into this sector today?  Do  you want to buy any of these stocks?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I don't want to buy any of them.  I own -- I still own some  Facebook, I still own Apple, I still own Amazon.  I would not -- I think  we're very late in the market cycle.  I think rates are still rising.   There's a lot of uncertainty on global trade and the tech industry's really  sensitive to global trade.</p><p>So I think it looks good relative to the market but I'm nervous about the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are so good.  How's the band going?  Moonalice?</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Awesome -- playing a lot of rock and roll.  It's summertime.   Moonalice.com for anybody who wants to check it out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are my rock and roll mentor.  Roger -- good to see you.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Always great to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roger McNamee.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  welcome back.</p><p>Las Vegas police releasing 9-1-1 calls from the deadliest mass shooting in  modern U.S. history.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They're tough to listen to -- Maria.</p><p>You hear things like panic, you hear fear, you hear the desperation in  these voices; as you said, Las Vegas police releasing these 9-1-1 calls  eight months after the mass shooting.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My friend just got shot.  We need an ambulance.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have three gunshot wounds and I have no idea where  we re.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You need an ambulance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And there's so many calls to listen to, folks.  Authorities also  releasing this video from surveillance cameras that show people frantically  fleeing the scene.  The gunfire came from the 32nd floor windows of the  Mandalay Bay Resort; 58 people were killed that night.</p><p>Well, incredible video of a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming last  night.  The National Weather Service said the tornado was on the ground for  at least 45 minutes.  Some brave people heading outside, snapping photos of  the monstrous twister -- brave or maybe just crazy, I don't know.</p><p>You can see the massive thunderstorm that sparked the tornado hovering  above.  No word yet if there was any damage or injuries but incredible  pictures.</p><p>Well, a more than 50 percent jump in fuel cost is hitting air travelers  right in the wallet as airlines start to raise their fares.  Delta Airlines  cutting its profit forecast for the year, adding it could take anywhere  from six months to a year to make up for increase fuel costs.  United  Airlines also expected to raise ticket prices very soon.  Shares of Delta  Airlines are down about 3 percent this year.  United Continental up about 4  percent.</p><p>Ok, here's something a little more fun.  For a bride to chew on as she  walks down the aisle, who doesn't want this?  Via Italian Kitchen  announcing this week couples tying the knot this summer could enter to win  an exclusive pizza bouquet and they get a boutonniere.</p><p>They claim it's going to be the first ever of its kind.  I think that's  true.  Entries have to be in by June 15th.  Win or lose, entrants will  receive a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  But for the pizza-loving  bride, Maria -- hey, why not girls do it.  Go for it.  Fully support it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>Coming up -- the battle over immigration.  House Republicans meet for  crucial negotiations today on border control, just as a startling new  report says illegal border crossings had hit 50,000 in the month of May.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The GOP getting ready for a crucial debate on immigration later today;  there are stark divisions within the Republican conference.  This, as the  DHS Reports that border arrests have exceeded 50,000 just for the month of  May.  And this is the third month in a row that they've exceeded 50,000.</p><p>Here now, Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York, a member of the  House Ways and Means Committee, who has signed a discharge petition which  could force votes on immigration.  Congressman -- good to see you, Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Thanks for having me  on -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you do that?  You need to force a decision on  immigration because it's so in the background at this point.  </p><p>REED:  This has been going on for months.  This is now seven months into  this issue of resolving it, not just for the Dreamers and these kids that  are caught up in a broken immigration system, but more fundamentally to  secure our borders and get this wall and structures constructed to secure  the border so we're starting to fix the problem.</p><p>And this discharge petition is just going to have an open debate on four  bills that will say let's go on record, put the position of the House out  there so that we can then go with the senate and see if we can get to the  White House to sign this and start legislating for the people back home.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Congressman -- the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark  Meadows sounded hopeful on the debate.  Here's what he said yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS:  We're still not in a  situation where there's an agreement.  I think there is great progress  that's being made.  Hopefully what we'll see is the objections get smaller  and less of hurdle in the hours to come.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are the hurdles -- Congressman?  Because, you know, at  the same time, you also hear Mitch McConnell saying this is never getting  anywhere before the midterm elections.  </p><p>REED:  Well, I'm glad to hear that type of conversation.  And I think this  petition is forcing and leveraging the pressure that is necessary to  finally say let's get this done.  And some of the issues that are out there  is what is the path for potential citizenship for the Dreamers, how much  money will go into the wall?  How much money will go into technology?  But  those are issues that we can work out and should have worked out months  ago.  But now we're getting to the point where it will get resolved because  they have no other option because the clock is ticking.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me switch gears here because we're waiting on the IG  report.  Jim Comey apparently defied authority when he was the FBI  director.  That's what we understand is in the IG report.  Does this chip  away at credibility there?  What are you expecting in terms of the  inspector general report which is forthcoming -- we expect this week.  </p><p>REED:  Well, first of all, absolutely it chips away at Mr. Comey's  credibility.  And remember who the IG is.  This is essentially the internal  affairs, the police of the police if you would, whose job is not to conduct  a political investigation but to hold accountable our government officials  such as James Comey to say look, I'm going to call balls and strikes here.</p><p>And that they are clearly saying and the information I'm hearing is  troublesome.  You acted insubordinate, in an insubordinate manner.  And at  the end of the day, when you have your FBI director doing that, we should  learn from it, we should hold people accountable and move forward in a  stronger fashion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman -- hi, James Freeman with the \"Wall Street Journal\".   We've been talking about the revelations this week that in order to  facilitate the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama secretly sought to give  Iran the ability to transact through the American financial system in order  to get frozen assets converted into dollars and then euros.</p><p>Does this -- does this change the politics in terms of how people on  Capitol Hill view the President's decision to abandon that deal?  Or is  this kind of a partisan rut where it doesn't have much impact?  </p><p>REED:  I hope it does.  But it definitely illustrates what I've been saying  all along about the Iranian deal.  That was, President Obama's  administration saying they were out of time, they needed to cut a deal,  they wanted to put this win up on the board.  And they were willing to  negotiate everything away in order to get the Iranian deal signed into law  in my humble opinion.</p><p>And this is yet just another sign of how they were doing that and trying to  move the ball for political deadlines rather than what we should be  focusing on, is substance of a deal that is going to keep nuclear weapons  out of the hands of Iranians.</p><p>And now what has happened is the President has gone forward in a leadership  role to say we're going to hold these guys accountable.  We're not going to  honor a deal that was done in a hasty manner in order to achieve some type  of deadline because they were leaving the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for those banks to push back and say we're not going do  it.  </p><p>REED:  Amen.  Thank God they did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want -- I want to add one thing, Congressman -- in terms  of it was almost as if American banks and even businesses knew that this  was a bad deal from the start.  </p><p>REED:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And would not step up because, again, you had just myriad  businesses in Europe immediately beginning to transact business with Iran  after this deal was done, oh so anxiously going into that country.  You did  not have that in the United States.</p><p>Boeing is kind of one of the only examples that we can cite of inking a  deal with Iran.  So it wasn't just the banks.  It was scores of other  companies.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's a great point.  And this is why we have a process for  treaties where people in this country, people overseas -- they understand  it's a real agreement.  The United States has made a decision.</p><p>President Obama didn't do that.  He basically got around the need for a  treaty.  They had this cheap maneuver in the Congress -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For the U.N.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, good for American businesses and banks in this case saying  this isn't going to fly and it won't fly with our customer.  </p><p>REED:  And if I could add, a great point, and that is why when President  Trump did this with the Iranian deal, it squarely is going to put American  businesses as well as European businesses, who are you going to side with?   The Iranians or America?</p><p>And that is going to be further leveraged to say I know where people will  want to do business. That's with us as proud Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- real quick before you go.  Are you going to do  phase two of the tax cut plan before the midterms?  </p><p>REED:  We're definitely moving forward on the committee.  We're drafting  that.  We're working on it, having conversations.  And we want to do it.   We want to protect those individuals and make this code permanent for  individuals as well as the expensing provisions for businesses across the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think that will be something we'll see before the  midterms?  </p><p>REED:  I do believe so.  We're on track to get that done and that's exactly  where I think we're going to land.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you sir.  Thank you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks for having us on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Reed joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the power of big tech -- the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 hitting  record highs, boosted by the technology sector.  We're taking at look at  how long this rally can last. </p><p>Then bottoms up at Wal-Mart -- the retailer going upscale with wine at  bargain prices.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  It is Thursday, June 7th.  Your top  stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>It is looking like a mixed picture for markets at the opening of trading  this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a gain of 70 points on the  Dow Jones Industrial average.  This right here, this is the high of the  morning, Dow industrials up 70, S&amp;P and NASDAQ are up just a fraction.  But  it is -- the Dow that's really going to be the splash.  Yesterday it was a  record-breaker for the NASDAQ and the Russell meanwhile.  The Russell 2000  Index and the NASDAQ hitting all-time highs while the Dow and S&amp;P 500  closed the day at their highest levels in three months.  Take a look at  those numbers, pretty strong performance.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story.  London's trading day got off to a  late start.  The market got hit by a rare technical glitch delaying the  open.  The FT-100 is up 20 points right now, the CAC Quarante and DAX index  are higher by a quarter of a percent at this hour.  </p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher as you can see there, with  the exception of China.  Shang Hai Composite was down a fraction.  </p><p>Coming up, more Americans banking on the big inheritance (INAUDIBLE) to  secure their future.  We'll take a look at this trend and how we're  investing it.</p><p>Starbucks customers, getting awakening this morning.  A cup of coffee just  got more expensive.

We've  got more for you coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, big tech continues to power  the markets.  The NASDAQ, the Russell 2000 index hitting at record highs  and the S&amp;P is not far behind.  Joining us right now is the chief  investment officer at Federated Investors, who just throw in there $15  billion in (INAUDIBLE) management, Stephen Auth is with us.  Stephen, good  to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're fully invested here.  </p><p>AUTH:  Well, pretty close.  Yes, we think that the market's heading higher.   The consensus I -- the consensus really is that we're going to roll over as  we approach the peak from back in early January and I think people think  we're late cycle.  Market's expensive.  We think we're not late cycle.  We  don't think the market's expensive.  And we're heading into an earnings  season, probably going to be the best earnings season in almost a decade.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We just came off of a great earnings season.  26 percent profit  growth.</p><p>AUTH:  We did.  And this one's even going to be better.  You know, earnings  will be up about 20 percent.  And we're only weeks away now.  And I think  that's the next focus on the market.  I think when once we power through  the January highs, you know, technically you could have the market head  considerably higher.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Steve, you pointed out that a lot of people are not bullish  this market, you know, they're giving a lot of reasons why the market  should roll over here.  And having been through 2000 and been through 2008,  but prior to those two periods you had everybody sell your house, invest in  the market.</p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Everybody was uber bullish.  Whereas now, I feel the consensus is  very negative which I think is a great opportunity for the market because  the earnings are really showing real growth in certain sectors.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, it's really funny, we've got this great fundamental backdrop,  yet the overall consensus is very cautious.  I put out a piece a couple of  weeks, I called the five myths.  And to me, you know, talking a lot to  investors, there's this belief that what goes up must come down, that we're  late cycle.  That the market's over expensive.  And it's just, we're not.   We're not late cycle.  If you look at where we are.  The expansion -- the  average expansion in this cycle per year is about 2.1 percent.  Whereas  most economic expansions would be more than double that.  You could argue - - you know, in time it's been long.  But in distance it hasn't been.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the age of it, like we're on our tenth year right now.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, people are worried about the age.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why we're bringing it up, that's what skeptics bring up.  </p><p>AUTH:  I think age is potentially a good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Age is just a number.  Come on. </p><p>AUTH:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Whatever you are is the new 30.  30 I'm wondering with the --  with the stocks, you're saying they're not expensive.  So, I thin  traditional analysis, you look at trailing earnings and you say, wow,  that's expensive.  You look at forward earnings it looks kind of  reasonable.  </p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is there a specific yardstick you use to say stocks are cheap,  stocks are not cheap? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, our yardstick is we look forward.  We try to analyze the  fundamentals of where we're heading.  And people have been saying this  market's expensive all the way up and it's mostly because they're looking  at trailing numbers.  But on a -- on a forward basis, this market is not  expensive.  And on individual stocks it's not expensive.  I mean, some of  the stocks we like, you mentioned some of the tech stocks, like Facebook as  an example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You like that?  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, stock's trading in, 24 times next year's earnings.  That's not  expensive.  Particularly with the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not compared to Amazon.  </p><p>AUTH:  Probably understated, yes, not compared to Amazon, Apple's 16 times,  J.P. Morgan stock we like, it's trading at 13 times.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Wait, why do you say Facebook's earnings are understated? What  does that mean? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, if you look at the traditional accounting in this country,  based on widget production basically, right?  So, when you invest in a  factory, you get to expense that over two decades.  But if you're investing  in tech and data, its immediate expensed.  But there's assets on the  balance sheets of companies like Facebook that are not even on the --  they're off-balance sheet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well they're not monetizing WhatsApp, they're not monetizing  the Messenger.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, all this data has enormous value.  And it's not showing up on  the balance sheets, they're already been expensed and in fact the  acquisition of it hasn't been.  So, you know, if you look on a cash flow  basis, these companies are generating enormous amounts of cash flow.  </p><p>MURPHY:  How much harder is your job right now?  Because the velocity of  change, with new technology coming out, you know, you have a company going  from a start-up, early stage company to a multibillion dollar company in a  couple of years.  Does that make your job and analyzing and valuing these  companies that much harder?</p><p>AUTH:  I think in general investing in stocks has become more and more  difficult.  At the same time, more and more investors have just gone  passive and that's what creates the great opportunity for the active  manager and active managers have now been outperforming the last 12 to 18  months.  There's so much money in the market that just -- is blindly  investing.  In some ways, it makes our job a little bit easier in effect.   But yes, I mean, is the complexity high? That's what you're exploring on  the show every morning.  It's gotten more and more complex.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  It is a complex world.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But even looking back 10 years, are investors still shaken from  the financial crisis and overinvested in fixed income, thinking that fixed  income, particularly treasuries -- longer term treasuries are some sort of  haven, is that the real concern here? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're staring at a bear market for something, right?</p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's either, it's going to be equities or -- </p><p>AUTH:  I mean, you're half full, half empty.  But I would say that the half  full element here and one of our thesis for what we call the secular bull.   We think we're in this long cycle secular bull is just that, the base of  this expansion is the worst economic crisis since really the great  depression and every economic actor out there has been negatively affected  by this and they all think sooner or later it's going to roll over.  Even  the regulators.  So they've been very kind to this market as a result.  So  when everyone's expecting something to happen, that's usually doesn't  happen.  And that's why stocks we think are still undervalued.  Is there a  bubble in bonds? We're not a believer of that.  We think bond yields are  low for a reason and we think they're going to grind higher but we only  anticipate -- and certainly if we had a big selloff in bonds, that would  hurt equities for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, the Federal Reserve meeting next week,  you're expecting the Fed to raise interest rates?  </p><p>AUTH:  Well, me and everyone else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And everybody else?</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Let's just talk about this for a second, during the break  we were talking about and noticing some of this price increases, the price  of coffee, Starbucks coffee's going up, airline tickets are going up.  What  else did we say? </p><p>MUROHY:  Gas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gasoline prices are going up.  Is inflation an issue?  How does  the Fed deal with that?  And what does the markets do as rates starts going  higher? </p><p>AUTH:  So, some things are going up.  But there's a lot of stuff not going  up.  Price of diapers isn't going up.  Most staples the prices are not  going up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>AUTH:  But there's not a lot of pricing power.  And you've got the Amazon  effect out there, literally with the Gatling gun on top of the mountain  top, waiting for anyone to volunteer there here (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right -- you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I'll throw it at you this way.  Maybe consumers aren't  getting those price increases passed along, that inflation, but it is  hitting businesses.  Steel prices even before these tariffs go into effect  are up 40 percent in the United States year-to-date or were through the end  of last week, even more year over year.  You have freight costs going up  and Cisco, the food company is saying our costs have gone up.  We can't  pass them under our customers.  That hits profit margins.  So, is that a  concern if you own stocks?  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, Dagen, we're about to produce a 20 percent year over year  quarterly gains in earnings in the upcoming quarter.  So yes, cost  pressures are affecting some companies and active investors like us, we're  very carefully watching which companies don't have enough pricing power or  aren't.  But there's other ways to offset commodity price increases as you  get productivity.  You get a corporate tax cut and maybe you use some of  that money to pay your workers a little --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the trade issue?  Are you worried about the trade  issue, aluminum and steel tariffs, China fight?  </p><p>AUTH:  No.  We're trying to get free and fair trade.  I mean, you've been  talking about this on the show.  But we just see that as a powerful  negotiation.  The president has most of the cards.  He's a very good  negotiator.  And you go into China, the good cops go in there, Kudlow and - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mnuchin.</p><p>AUTH:  Mnuchin, right?  And they say look, here's the deal.  You guys are  shipping $500 billion to us a year.  We're shipping you 120.  We want that  number to change.  You've got to take down some of your barriers so we can  ship more to you.  Give us $200 billion or the bad cops are going to be  over here, Navarro, etcetera.  That's what's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, you know what?  I'm so glad you're here.  Because this  was the top of our show.  This was the first words we said.  Dagen brought  this up at the top of the show saying, why we're all worried about all this  trade stuff and look at the markets new record highs.  This is why.   Stephen Auth just told us the sentiments of Wall Street.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.  You think this is all a negotiation.   You just want a better trade deal.  </p><p>AUTH:  And you know, a month ago we were talking about do the Chinese cheat  or not?  Now we're talking about how much is it?  You know, we're up to $80  billion, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AUTH:  Well OK, that's not going to work.  But we'll carry, the bid ask is  now 8200.  I couldn't find a number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the last time I check, $300 billion cost, to the theft of  intellectual property a year? </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're saying basically you think these larger problems are going  to be pushed aside.  I don't think this is progress that the government  says we're now going to set numbers for imports and exports.  Is it? </p><p>AUTH:  Look, to me the press is hysterical about this and if you think  about it, all the president wants is free and fair trade.  The tariffs is a  cajole he's using to negotiate better terms.   BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>AUTH:  The rest of the world, we're dealing with an entitlement here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  Even our so-called allies in Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AUTH:  We rebuilt the world after World War II.  We gave them all these  deals.  And now we're saying end of the entitlements.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yesterday Kudlow called the tariffs a tool.  There you go.</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, good to see you.  </p><p>AUTH:  Likewise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Stephen Auth joining us, Federated  Investors.</p><p>Coming up, get ready to pay more for your coffee.  You just heard it.   Starbucks is raising prices again.  We'll tell you how much.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  welcome back.  Starbucks hiking the cost of your morning cup of  coffee again.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  OK, this is going to get expensive, Maria.  Starbucks fans are  going to have to dig a bit deeper for the cup of Joe in the morning.  The  company raising prices between $00.10 and $00.20 on all sizes of its brewed  coffee in most of its stores here in the U.S.  Starbucks blaming the move  on the nine percent increase in operating expenses for the first half of  its fiscal year.  That's compared to last year.  Starbucks shares are down  less than one percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Jessica Alba's Honest Company receiving a fresh round of funding.   The company is getting a $200 million investment from private equity firm L  Catterton.  The Honest says, that the new investment is going to help  expand its business globally, increase product supply and funds of  innovation.  The company has not disclosed the size of the stake that L  Catterton is actually going to receive in all of this.  </p><p>Well, bargain hunters can now grab a fancy bottle of wine at Wal-Mart.  The  company trying to appeal to more upscale tastes, launching its own wine  label called Wine Makers Selection.  Customers are going to be able to buy  10 fine wines from California, France and Italy.  Retailing for about  $11.00 a bottle.  The retailer says the wine will be higher quality than  other brands of wine that it actually currently sells.  This puts them of  course in direct competition with their rival Costco.  Costco's got its own  private wine label.  Shares of Wal-Mart down 14 percent this year.  Costco  shares are up six percent.  </p><p>And then I'm so excited about this, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are  teaming up for the fourth rendition of a \"Star Is Born\" and Oscar buzz is  already swirling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOPER:  Do you write songs or anything? </p><p>GAGA:  I don't sing my own songs.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why? </p><p>GAGA:  I just don't feel comfortable.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why wouldn't you feel comfortable? </p><p>GAGA:  Almost every single person has told me they like the way I sound,  but they don't like the way I look.  </p><p>COOPER:  I think you're beautiful.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Bradley Cooper is directing Lady Gaga's feature debut as a  Hollywood lead.  Cooper plays an aging performer who takes a shy, talented  young singer played of course by, Lady Gaga.  Under his wing, she of course  brings her musical expertise to the film.  There's a slew of original songs  for this one.  She wrote a handful of them with Cooper and other artists  like Mark Ronson and Willie Nelson's son, Lukas.  \"A Star is Born\" hits  theaters October 5th.  I was actually looking at the trailer last night.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow that really does look good.  I'm looking forward to it too.  </p><p>CASONE:  Her songs are incredible on this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, she's going to be compared to Janet Gaynor,  Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand who all played this role.  So, that's  what she will be compared to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, you're saying --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  High expectation.  Coming up, windfall as the pathway to  wealth, we'll tell you why a third of Americans are banking on an  inheritance to shore up their financial futures.  Are you one of them,  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans are relying on their parents for  money, that's according to a new report from Merrill Edge that finds one in  three Americans are relying on an inheritance for financial stability.   Joining us right now in a FOX Business Exclusive is Bank of America Merrill  Edge head Aron Levine.  Good to see you, Aron.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>ARON LEVINE, MERRILL EDGE HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA:  Hey, good to see you  again.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this survey finds that number jumping to 63 percent.</p><p>LEVINE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When narrowed down between generation z or those aged between  18 and 22.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Yes, you think about that 18 to 22, that youngest generation is  facing three really serious challenges, right?  One, student debt.  It's  now up to $1.5 trillion.  29 percent increase in just the last four years.   All right, that's one huge one.  Second one, it is a fact that their  parents are living longer, they have a perception they're going to live  longer.  So now, I'm thinking about what if I live in to my 80s or 90s.   And how do I finance that?  Over the course of time.  And third is, they  are now at point now where they're starting college and thinking about well  I need to save for a home someday.  I have always competing priorities.   So, when you take in those three things, student debt, longevity and  competing priorities, they're saying, boy, I hope I get some inheritance to  solve this problem.  Because I'm really not sure how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since, I know an 18-year-old is not thinking  about their retirement.  But they're not getting Social Security, today's  18-year-old, I don't think, now that we know that the Social Security going  to be dipping into its trust fund for the first time in 36 years.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Right. Yes.  So, it's really creating a new normal in a lot of  ways.  In terms of how to redefine retirement.  I think we talked about the  last time I was on, if you're in your young 20s, you're not sincerely  saying at 65 I'm going to have this pot of money and I'm just going to get  out of the workforce.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVINE:  I think there's a clear view that says, you know, I may continue  working, hopefully it's not in the same job I'm in and I have some  financial freedom.  But the question is, how do I finance that over the  course of time versus some lump sum I have to have by a certain age?  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, Aron, one thing I see as a big change in the landscape, this  would be access that the younger generation has to information, it's  education.  I think 18 to 22-year-olds today are starting to learn more and  focus more about their money, about retirement, about what they're going to  need.  And I think that's a huge benefit to the entire country.  </p><p>LEVINE:  You're absolutely right.  So, I think all those fears that I sort  of talked about, that the upside is they're very self-aware and they are  actually taking advantage of the access.  So they go online, they're  starting to educate themselves.  And it's our job, places like Merrill Edge  and Bank of America to provide that education access and then say, what  would you like to do about it?  And I think what you're seeing is, that's  leading towards where this generation has a kind of profits and purpose  mindset.  So if I'm going to invest my money, I want to invest in something  that's a little more socially conscious.  And that's why it's important  that all of the industry is delivering those kinds of investment vehicles  so that generation can say boy, I do want to invest.  I'd love to invest in  a company that has a certain sort of moral compass.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And so, when you advise Generation Z, step one, do you say OK,  your parents by the way are going to live maybe to 100 and by the way,  we're looking at the finances of Social Security and Medicare, you're  probably on your own.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Yes, I think the -- hopefully not in your -- on one ways you're  not on your own, as you can get some advice and there are ways to reach  out.  I think what we're trying to do is say, one, you're your self- educated and focus on a plan.  Like anything, like, you can't just do it  without a very clear plan.  So that's what we key on is getting them a life  plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you.  Good to see you.  Aron Levine, Bank of  America.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining is this morning.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, June 7th.  Your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Markets are higher this morning, off of highs but the nonetheless showing  gain at the start of trading about 55 points on the Dow, up a quarter of a  point on the -- up two points rather on the S&amp;P.  The NASDAQ just slip into  negative territory.  It is down two points right now after NASDAQ and  Russell 2000 Index is closed all-time highs yesterday again.  The Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 yesterday finished at the highest levels in three months in.   In Europe this morning mixed performances.  Take a look, as you see, the  FT-100 is up 32 points in the day.  It was a rough beginning for London.   Trading on the London Stock Exchange was delayed this morning due to a  technical issue.  In Asia overnight markets mostly higher.  Take a look,  fractional moves pretty much higher across the board with the exception of  China.  Trade tensions.  </p><p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is headed to the White House today ahead  of the G7 meeting.  President Trump at odds with the other six nations in  the G7 going into the Summit over his tariff and trade policies.  Larry  Kudlow weighed in on trade fight on \"AFTER THE BELL\" yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  We're not even, it is  not a level playing field.  And the President has made a decision to be  strong, he's got strong backbone as you know and he is saying look, tariffs  are part of our quiver.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump just tweeting this on trade, isn't it ironic  getting ready to go to the G7 in Canada to fight for our country on trade.   We have the worst trade deals ever made.  Then off to Singapore to meet  with North Korea and the nuclear problem.  But back home we still have the  13 angry Democrats pushing the witch-hunt.  The President just tweeted that  this morning.  Meanwhile, securing the southern border.  Startling new  reports as illegal border crossings hit 50,000 in the month of May.  We  have the very latest coming up.  Sorry, well, not really sorry.  Samantha  Bee returning to her show after her vulgar comments about Ivanka Trump.   She apologized but to her but she also lashed out at her critics and  skeptics.</p><p>Twitter shares flying high.  The company is now looking to take advantage  by issuing convertible bonds.  Now some are raise questions about the  evaluation of Twitter.  It is being included in the S&amp;P 500 as well.  Coca- cola taking a page out of Pepsi's playbook.  The soft drink giant going  clear.  Where you can find it coming up.  All those stories coming up this  Thursday morning.  And joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business  Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff Capital CEO and managing partner, Mike  Murphy, and the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor,  James Freeman.  Great to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good show so far, guys.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Lots of fun so far.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  A lot to talk about.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  What does it say about Facebook -- sorry, Twitter  management's belief in the valuation that they're doing these convertibles?  </p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's actually a good.  The stock has moved 300 percent and  it converts up around $57.00 a share.  So, I think they're taking some  money in after this big moves up.  I think I like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good thing, Mike Murphy, you pulled that one out of your hankie  pocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The stock is up --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was ready for that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think it's got -- so it's $57.00 valuation.  The stock  is up 40.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It converts, and they're paying .25 percent interest.  So they're  basically getting free money and they're using the huge run-up that the  stock has had.  I like it -- from a CEO standpoint I like it, as an  investor, I like it also.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To tee up your upcoming guest when we have that last Congressman  on and he mentioned another round of tax cuts, tax reform.  James Freeman  was over there giggling like somebody just put a dozen cupcakes in fronts  of him.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's fun.  Yes.  No.  It doesn't make your eyes lined up when you  think about the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  You were like smiling and giggling.  It was hilarious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anyone make the tax cuts on individuals permanent.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  They should.  Mitch McConnell should be putting this on the floor  every day, calling the Democrats on it.  Also, you know, we've seen how  important growth is, and we're going to be talking about entitlements, how  important growth is and that's why they're not looking so good lately after  the last weeks and years of not so great growth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the data has been better, that's for sure.  Joining the  conversation this morning, the founder, president, and CEO of Murray  Energy, Bob Murray is with us along with the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\"  Stuart Varney weighing in as well.  Don't miss.  We got a lot of coming up  this hour.  But first, let's kick it off right here with this top story and  that is preparing for trade fight.  President Trump not backing down from  his hard-line stance on trade as he prepares to meet with the leaders from  the G7 industrialized countries tomorrow.  </p><p>It will be the first chance that world leaders have to confront the  President in person.  Since the U.S. slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum  imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union last week.  Joining me  right now to weigh in from Washington is a member of the House Financial  Services Committee, Congressman Sean Duffy of Wisconsin.  Congressman, it's  good to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY (R), WISCONSIN:  Good morning, Maria.  It's great to be  with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on this?  Are you concerned about fallout  from these trade tensions particularly when it comes to the retaliatory  measures.  We've heard from all of the above and they're going to come  right back at us with similar tariffs on imports.  </p><p>DUFFY:  And, you know, they're trying to use politics as to -- as to who  they targets with regard to the tariffs.  So in Wisconsin, Donald Trump as,  you know, won by a very slim margin, he went up in my district as a swing  set of voters.  And so they're targeting cranberries, we produced the most  cranberries in America in my district.  We make the premier ginseng in the  world.  We're world famous in Asia for Marathon County Ginseng in my  district, they're targeting ginseng now too.  (INAUDIBLE) and day, they're  targeting those products.  </p><p>So, I got to tell you what though, I think that though my constituents are  a bit nervous about how this is going to play out.  They support the  President because they understand that free trade has to be fair and they  understand the world has not been fair to America, they want him to fight  and make this a better playing field which means in the long run, they're  going to be able to sell more of their products in a global stage as  opposed to, you know, having, you know, access to markets but a more  limited access because of unfair trade practices by our trade partners.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But -- I mean, what about that?  I mean, you mentioned  dairy, aren't you looking at a shortage in Wisconsin of dairy?  I mean,  isn't that going to turn prices up?  Governor Scott Walker now creating a  task force to focus on coming up with a recommendation to save the state's  diary industry produces roughly what?  14 percent of the country's milk?   So if we're going to have tariffs on that, when you're already talking  about a shortage, doesn't this send prices sky-high and impact voters?   </p><p>DUFFY:  First of all, by the way, at 14 percent, Maria, we make the best  milk in America, to our cows produce the tastiest milk, so we should drink  Wisconsin dairy milk.  That aside, no we've -- so when prices go down, our  farmers milk more cows.  When our prices go up, they milk more cows.  So  now we have supply and demand problem.  Our prices are low right now, we  have a glut of supply.  And so what we have to do is how do we actually get  a balance in this market where our farmers can actually get a fair price  for their milk when they can actually make a profit.  We don't just have a  big farms but a little small Wisconsin dairy farms can survive and thrive. </p><p>Canada has not been fair in this space and so I think with regard to the to  NAFTA the way President Trump has played this out, we're going to have  Canada come to the table and renegotiate how they deal with dairy, between  our two countries and in the end, that's going to help the Wisconsin dairy  farmer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you want a bilateral deal with Canada and a bilateral deal  with Mexico?  </p><p>DUFFY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like the President have suggested?  You don't.</p><p>DUFFY:  No.  I'm fine with NAFTA but I'm saying during this negotiation  because the President has held out for a longer period of time, I think  he's a bit freaked out Canada and Mexico.  They're coming to the table and  they're willing to negotiate on things four months ago, five months ago.   They weren't willing to negotiate.  And for us, this dairy issue with  Canada is incredibly important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  No, I get you.  And I understand the President wanting to  play poker in some sense, you know, come out and explain the issue.  $800- billion deficit with the rest of the world.  We need better deals, I get  that but how worried are you that this goes horribly wrong?  That in fact,  we see retaliation from all of these countries, we've already heard they're  going to come up with the same tariffs, 25 percent.  And it sends prices  higher, sends the economy into recession and really turns off voters?  </p><p>DUFFY:  Listen, we should all be nervous about that.  I mean, this is --  this is somewhat high stakes poker as you mentioned, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  But the benefit of actually negotiating better trade feels I think  is fantastic for Americans' future.  What the problem is it can go wrong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  But even if you look at China, I mean, if you don't deal with  China's unfair trade practices, there are tariffs barriers or the fact that  they steal our I.P.  If we don't deal with them today, is it going to be  easier to deal with China, you know, 10 or 15 years from now, our economy  is not much bigger or their military is not much stronger?  You have to  deal with these problems right now.  It should have been dealt with, you  know, 20 years ago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No.  The China story I totally agree with.  They've  been stealing for us -- from us for decades and I think the President is  right to push back.  Let me ask you about immigration, House Republicans  are meeting this morning for a potential make-or-break negotiations to try  and hammer out an immigration deal.  I mean, what are the major sticking  points?  Is it all about DACA?  And where do you stand on the so-called  DREAMers?  </p><p>DUFFY:  So I will tell you that we have to be fair what we do with the  DACA, young people, not all kids but, you know, some of them now into  adulthood.  You know, how many get into the program, about 800,000 under  Barack Obama, President Trump said let's do 1.8 million, what is that  number?  When we -- when we let them in the country, do they have a pathway  to citizenship?  Can they become U.S. citizens?  What do you with their  parents brought them in illegally?  Those are all sticking points that we  have to navigate and negotiate.  And then what we do with the border wall.   The President wants $25 billion for the border.  Well, one Congress can't  find the next Congress, so we can appropriate, you know, $25 billion today  but there is a new Congress in January.  </p><p>And if they try to take that money away, you have what happened to Ronald  Reagan in '86 where you have amnesty today for border security tomorrow and  border security never comes.  So, try to navigating and negotiate  (INAUDIBLE) two together is going to be important.  And, you know, we have  a two-hour meeting this morning.  I'm going from you to this meeting and I  think that, you know, from the Freedom Caucus to guys like you know, Will  Hurd and Jeff Denham and Carlos Curbelo who -- this is a really important  issue for them politically.  We're going to be able to come to a -- to a  consensus on how you deal with DACA and board security.  And the bottom  line is the Senate says, we can't do what the House is going to do.  And we  have to say, that's -- I don't care about the Senate.  We're going to pass  a bill that can pass the House.  And then let's see what the Senate does  because have Democrats to say, I care about these kids.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>DUFFY:  Let's help the kids out.  But I don't think they want to actually  help the kids.  They love the political issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're not really helping the kids.  Right. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>DUFFY:  They're not helping the kids and I think when you send a bill to  the Senate, you're going to see them contorted and twisted trying to figure  out how to deal with a Republican package that actually helps immigrant  kids who came in no-fault of their own as a young children.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, what a week we have coming up.  We got the  Kim  Jong-un-Donald Trump meeting on the 12th, we've got obviously, the Federal  Reserve is meeting and you've got the ECB meeting but also the Justice  Department's internal watchdog, the inspector general coming out with its  report reportedly concluding that Jim Comey defied authority at times  during his tenure as FBI director.  This comes from ABC news and they say a  draft of the inspector general's report specifically uses the word  insubordinate to describe Comey's behavior.  It criticizes former Attorney  General Loretta Lynch for her handling of the Clinton e-mail investigation.   Your reaction and what are you expecting in the coming weeks from this I.G  report and its implications?  </p><p>DUFFY:  Well, you know, I think -- this -- what this I.G. report is going  to show if the reports are accurate, the leaks are accurate and by the way,  this is another example of how there's no secrets in this town, Maria.   Everything leaks out.  And so I think this is going to be vindication that  our concern about how the FBI and the DOJ were playing politics, how they  weren't playing in a way that they traditionally have played in run-ups to  elections or Presidential candidates.  We're going to be vindicated in our  concern over the last year and a half rather in regard to what the FBI and  the DOJ actually did with regard to Hillary Clinton and to Donald Trump.   And I think the most important thing here, Maria, is America has to have  faith and trust in the FBI and the DOJ.  I mean, we give them incredible  power to keep us safe.  And if we don't trust them, we take that power away  and then we're less safe.  So we have to clean house, we have to shine the  light into what went wrong, we have to fix it, we have to get good people  back into these agencies so we can continue with the power that they have  that they use appropriately but actually keep the next 9/11 from happening.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say we're all going to be vindicated, what does that mean?   Are we going to see accountability for this stuff if in fact they did tip  the scales or tried to tip scales in favor of Hillary Clinton and try to --  and away from Donald Trump?   </p><p>DUFFY:  Well, I think -- when I say vindication, I mean, we're going to  expose what did Loretta Lynch do.  What did Jim Comey do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So we'll actually get the details.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUFFY:  What did Andrew McCabe do?  Yes.  We get the details and I think we  can learn from those mistakes.  It's not my call on -- are they prosecuted,  they commit crimes, I don't know that.  I haven't seen the reporter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick before you go.  Sean, are you comfortable with  what's happening with ZTE?  I mean, Congress was upset when the President  came out and said we got to help with jobs, now apparently there's a new in  place in place with the U.S. and ZTE.  The Chinese telecom company.  </p><p>DUFFY:  No, actually.  I'm not sure what the President is negotiating  behind the scenes.  I'm not aware of those conversations.  Obviously  something is at play here that I think the President was offered that  allowed him to bring ZTE back into -- a space because going to consider  negotiating and save them.  I don't like it.  But, again, I don't have all  the facts and nor do you, I think the President is only one who knows what  the offer is on table from the Chinese and how to resolve these trade  imbalances and ZTE for the Chinese is a big part of that resolution.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Congressman, it's good to  see you, sir.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Bye, Maria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Sean Duffy joining us.  Stay tuned for Fox  Business.  Our special extended coverage of the U.S. Summit with North  Korea.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will be starting an hour earlier on Tuesday,  5:00 a.m. Eastern as this historic summit takes place.  We'll be live from  5:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.  I hope you get up early with us as we cover  this U.S.-North Korea Summit.  Take a break right here.  Twitter is making  its entry into the S&amp;P 500 by planning to sell a billion dollars in  convertible debt.  Details on the social media company's second ever debt  offering coming up.  Then no laughing matter, Samantha Bee's new apology  after using an explicit to describe Ivanka Trump.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Alice Marie Johnson speaks out after President  Trump commuted her prison sentence.  Cheryl Casone with all the details  now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, Johnson tasting her first full day  of freedom after spending almost 21 years behind bars in Alabama for non- violent drug and money laundering charges.  The 63-year old reunited with  her family and her friends yesterday.  In an interview this morning she  says what she would tell President Trump if she have the opportunity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALICE MARIE JOHNSON, INMATE:  I would tell President Trump thank you so  much that I am going to be that one that is going to make you so proud.   And I hope that my life will encourage him to do this for others, too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, her release coming after Kim Kardashian-West lobbied  President Trump for her release.  This picture was taken last week.   President Trump tweeting just moments ago, good luck to Alice Johnson.   Have a wonderful life.  Well, remember this vulgar comment, comedian  Samantha Bee hurled at the President's daughter?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SAMANTHA BEE, AMERICAN-CANADIAN COMEDIAN:  One mother to another, do  something about your dad's immigration practices you feckless (bleep) he  listens to you. Put on something tight and low-cut and tell you father to  (bleep) stop it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, she returned to her show on CBS Full Frontal and she  apologized on air for that comment again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BEE:  A lot of people were offended and angry that I used an epithet to  describe the President's daughter and adviser last week.  It is a word I  have used on the show many times.  Hoping to reclaim it.  This time it.   This time I used it as insult.  I crossed the line, I regret it and I do  apologize for that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the Full Frontal host is still facing scrutiny according to  the Hollywood reporter TBS is having more oversight of her show and hopes  preventing backlash from another potential incident.  </p><p>And then finally check this out, an alligator head butt to trapper.  Just  go ahead and watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  OK.  So, yes.  They were trying to remove from a Florida  neighborhood.  The trappers appeared to have control of the alligator but  the gator fought back, whipping its neck around to head butt one of them.   The officer was OK.  Eventually they did get the gator -- into the truck.   I just shiver every time I watch that video.  Yes.  These things are mean.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very scary.  Yes.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  A new warning about the danger of drones.  Why the  Department of Homeland Security is reportedly pushing for more authority in  the wake of looming threats, that's next.  And then the new twist on an old  plastic.  Where you can buy Coca-Cola's first clear soda, coming up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New concerns this morning over the danger of  drones.  The Department of Homeland Security reportedly pushing for greater  authority to destroy them.  According to Reuters, DHS is concerned over  terrorists already using the devices on the battlefield abroad.  Joining us  now, Fox News Correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  And Lea, as a veteran and  former Intel official, what type of threats do drones create?  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  They create a huge threat both on  the battlefield like you just mentioned but also here in the United States.   I've heard from operators and special mission units that have told me that  the enemy, ISIS and other terrorist organizations overseas have been using  drones, they're cheap, they're easy to buy, you can put things on them like  cameras and you can put payloads on them like small weapons and different  types of sensors, things like chemical biological -- radiological things  that can harm people.  So, not only they are the dangers overseas but here  in the United States.  The real issue with drones is they're so small, you  can't see them coming.  So if you look at like a national capital area, the  area where -- Washington, you see the President or the Congressmen and  Senators are.  So many people come to visit.  That's an area that has  restricted airspace but you can't see drones flying on radar into that  airspace.  </p><p>So there's been a huge problem with keeping people out.  Whether they're  just being negligent because they're flying drones and they're not really  paying attention to where they're going or they don't know the rules, the  bottom line is our Federal Law Enforcement officials need to be able to  take those drones down when they become a problem.  For example, if drones  are flown into a populated area like over a stadium, is it somebody who  just hasn't been paying attention to the rule, somebody who just is curious  and isn't being responsible or just somebody who wishes to do us harm but  we know the enemy will use them on the battlefield, they will certainly use  them here to make attacks on us in our country if we let them.  If we don't  give law Enforcement the tools to be able to take them down.  </p><p>MURPHY:  OK.  You would like to be able to address the concern on the other  hand, I know a lot of consumers want this not just same day but immediate  delivery, we're probably going to be seeing more of this.  Is this really  an issue more for just getting good intelligence on bad guys before they  strike as opposed to regulating drones in particular?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I don't think that that's possible.  I think that, you know,  the issue of drones they've just grown so quickly and unfortunately,  regulations really didn't get ahead of the commercial business of drones.   So they've become -- something that people consider a toy, they've been  something -- they've become something people use in their businesses, like  people in a real estate like to, you know, take videos with drones,  photographers, wedding photographers, it just exploded as an industry and  they really didn't get ahead of it on regulation but I have been on your  show before reporting on how at a local level law enforcement officials  have had problems with drones.</p><p>For example, SWAT teams who all of a sudden look up and they see a drone  and they don't know if it's the bad guy in the building that they're going  up against that's collecting intelligence on them or was just somebody  who's flown a drone into the -- into the area but the bottom line is if  they don't have ability to take it down it's going to be a problem.  And I  think when you think -- you know, when you look at this, you have to -- you  have to think what's more important?  Our security or people playing with  drones?  So it's important to give people the ability to grow their  businesses, to give them ability to use this fun and exciting new tool but  it's also important to protect us as Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We got a big summit next week, Lea, North Korean Summit,  Wall Street Journal article today revealing that the U.S. and North Koreans  delegates are negotiating everything from the menu to the seating chart.   Your take on this upcoming meeting on Tuesday.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, I think that's pretty typical when you look at meetings  of leaders of countries, that the protocol is always going to be very  important, they're going to be a lot of people assigned to developing how  that, you know, how the protocol is implemented and to coming up with the  plans.  There is a lot of sensitivities involved as well and I know the  North Koreans are very sensitive about the placement of its leader and  where he will be.  There are things like, you know, little details like who  comes in the room first, signifies who is more important when they take  pictures together will both flags be in those pictures.  When they walk  into a setting, how many steps will they go down before stopping?  All  these details are going to be planned because this needs to go off as  smoothly as possible but, you know, one thing that you're going to hear  about is also that there are some advantages that are going to be played  into these negotiations but it's all -- it's all going to be very important  because you do have some ego involved in this -- in this meeting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just a little.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Just a little.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We leave it there.  Lea, good to see you. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we are going to be live beginning at 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday  for this North Korean summit with the United States.  So join us early from  5:00 to 9:00.  We have special coverage throughout the day on Tuesday  morning and Monday night.  We have this breaking news.  We can confirm that  the administration has struck a deal with Chinese telecom firm ZTE.  ZTE  will pay a billion-dollar fine and have a $400-million escrow account for  future enforcement action.  The commerce department will select a group of  compliance coordinators to monitor ZTE for 10 years.  Again, a billion  dollar fine there.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, I'll speak with  the founder, President and CEO Murray Energy, Bob Murray.  He is weighing  in on the outlook for coal, the energy sector and a lot more.  Back in a  moment right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Thursday, everybody, thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, June 7th, your top  stories right now 8:31 a.m. on the East Coast.  Breaking news, Fox Business  has learned the administration has struck a deal with Chinese telecom firm  ZTE.  The company will pay a billion-dollar fine and have $400 million in  escrow for future enforcement action.  The commerce department will select  a group of compliance coordinates to monitor ZTE for the next 10 years.  </p><p>We may be in for a mixed day on markets.  Futures indicating a mixed  showing at the start of trading, although, the Dow Jones Industrials  Average has been strong throughout the morning, showing a gain right now  about 60 points right out of the gate, that's a quarter of a percent  higher.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are mixed, as you can see, the NASDAQ is  down right now five points.  It was a record-breaking ride yesterday,  though, for the NASDAQ along with the Russell 2000 Index.  The Dow and the  S&amp;P 500 closed the day at their highest levels in three months.  The NASDAQ  hit an all-time high.  Today, of course, we look at a bit of a pullback.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, London's trading day got off to a late start, the  market got hit by a rare technical glitch forcing a late opening.  Markets  right now are trading higher across the board with the FT-100 up a quarter  of a percent.  In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, as you  can see there.  </p><p>Trade tensions continued to intensify ahead of this weekend's G7 meeting.   Ahead of the meeting, Japanese Prime Shinzo Abe heads to the White House  later today.  The President is at odds with six other countries going into  the summit over his tariff and trade policy.  Meanwhile, President Trump  getting ready to fulfill another campaign promise.  The President appears  ready to push ahead with support for coal miners as he's been touting for  months.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And other countries, they  love their coal.  Over here we haven't treat it with the respect it  deserves.  We're going to fight for you like I promised I would in the  campaign, and you were very good to me and I'm going to be even better to  you, I promise you that.</p><p>We are going to put our coal miners back to work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll discuss the President's plans and how it could help the  coal industry with coal executive Bob Murray, coming up.</p><p>Twitter shares at a three-year high this morning.  We will tell why the  social media company plans to -- plans $1 billion in bonds, raising some  eyebrows on Wall Street.  The company is doing a billion-dollar convert  plan as enabling it to enter the S&amp;P 500, by the way.  Coca-Cola has a  clear strategy in Japan.  We will tell you what they are doing to attract  more drinkers.</p><p>First, though, this, topping our news this half an hour, crossing party  lines to President Trump 2020.  Democratic Senator from West Virginia, Joe  Manchin, tells POLITICO, \"He is open to supporting the person who I think  is best for my country and my state.  If his policies are best, I'll be  right there.\"  Meaning President Trump.  Manchin reportedly goes on to say,  his support of Hillary Clinton was a political mistake, given her comments  during the 2016 campaign about putting coal miners out of business with her  plans for cleaner energy solutions.  Joining us right now is Murray Energy  Founder, President, and CEO, Bob Murray.  Good to see you, Bob, thanks so  much for joining us.</p><p>ROBERT MURRAY, CEO, MURRAY ENERGY CORPORTATION:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting to see Senator Manchin's possible move saying he  would support President Trump and it was a mistake to support Hillary  Clinton.</p><p>MURRAY:  Well, of course, it was.  And, of course, he's a politician.   Hillary Clinton is anathema in West Virginia and many parts of the country  today as you well know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURRAY:  But he did support her.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about these plans the President wants to push forward with  these plans to order power companies across the country to buy electricity  from struggling coal and nuclear plants.  This is unprecedented, it's an  effort to help coal and nuclear power plants that are on the brink of  collapse because of competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable  energy sources.  Tell us more about the plan.  We know it's not a done deal  yet.</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes.  We fully support President Trump and Energy Secretary  Perry's efforts to secure the reliability, resiliency, and the security of  the nation's electric power grid.  The failed policies, Maria, of the Obama  administration current Congressional Democrats, and the total inaction of  the feckless Federal Energy Regulatory Commission members have necessitated  this federal action to prevent catastrophic brownouts and blackouts in our  country.  For instance, the State of Texas and California will face  operational challenges and potential reliability concerns this summer,  because of Texas's loss of base load generation and California's radical  policies, relative to their electric power supply.  </p><p>So, you see, it is not about coal miners and about coal, it is about  reliable, low-cost, secure, resilient electric power supplies for that  couple on fixed income, for that manufacturer of a product for the global  marketplace, for that single mom, we must have base load generation which  is being eliminated at an alarming rate.  And the President and Secretary  Perry get it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK, Bob, James Freeman here at The Wall Street Journal.  I'm a  little concerned here, though, I agree it was time for the war on coal to  end but now it seems like the President is maybe going in the other  direction toward a war on behalf of coal.  Wouldn't it be better to just  get the government out of the business of encouraging some energy sources,  discouraging others, instead of saying to the -- to plant operators, you  must buy this particular mix?  Why not just discourage alternative energy  requirements?  He's got a lot of power, a lot of programs at the federal  level.  He can just say, we're no longer going to put our thumb on the  scale on behalf of wind or solar or whatever the next (INAUDIBLE) is?</p><p>MURRAY:  You're right and you're wrong.  Number one, the government is very  much involved in the electric power grid.  Right now, windmills and solar  panels get a 30 percent production tax credit from the taxpayer.  You  cannot say that they are not subsidized, indeed, Warren Buffett himself  said, they don't make sense.  He's the largest operator of windmills in the  country, but he says we make a lot of money off of the production tax  credit.  So, the government is already involved.  We need --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  But let's focus on getting --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MURRAY:  -- favoring some fuels and ways to generate electricity over  others.  So, we are just trying to balance the playing field.  In -- before  Mr. Obama, 52 percent of our electricity came from coal.  He closed 531  coal fired plants.  That's 56,000 megawatts, another 12,700 carrying over  from the Obama administration will close by the end of 2020.  Our power  share will go down to 27 percent from the 15 percent.  In recent cold snap,  the only one this winter, and the PJM Interconnection from December 27th to  January 8th, 2 million Americans lost their power.  22 people lost their  lives.  During this time, nuclear and power and coal supplied 70 percent of  the electricity in the PJM Interconnection.  37,000 megawatts of supposedly  natural gas powered electricity were entirely unavailable due to priority  for home heating and use and inability of the freezing natural gas  pipelines to supply the electric plants.  So, we need to have capacity.  We  need to have these -- this power available.  One other thing --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURRAY:  -- electric power during this very winter, $500 dollars a kilowatt  hour from its usual $30.00 a kilowatt hour.  The price of natural gas  increased 60 times during those 12 days.  That's -- to $175 (INAUDIBLE)  from $3.00.  So, wind and solar did not provide anything and coal and  nuclear provided 70 percent of our electricity.  That --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you told -- you told government all of this.  I mean, we're  learning more about how this push for the legislation came about.   According to these details uncovered in the Freedom of Information Act  request from E! News and energy publication, you wrote up six versions of  the executive orders including this energy measure, you gave them to the  administration.  Why did you feel the need to get involved in that way?   Bob?</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have these revelations about your involvement in the  potential regulations.  Do you think the President is going to get a major  pushback on that?  Why do you think you needed to get involved in that way?</p><p>MURRAY:  Yes, I think he will get a major pushback from those who support  natural gas and windmills and solar panels, but it has to be done because  we have very unreliable electric power grids.  Wait and see what happens  this summer in Texas and California, it already happened in December,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURRAY:  We have a dangerous situation in the United States of America  today.</p><p>MURPHY:  Bob, this is Mike Murphy.  You know, we hear so much about oil and  natural gas, and how new technology is making it easier and having a major  impact on those industries.  Is new technology also having a big impact on  the coal industry?</p><p>MURRAY:  Not yet because there's been no commitment to it.  They are  technology, sir, HELE, high energy low emission technology that can reduce  the emissions from natural gas or from coal to be low natural gas.  But  there's been no commitment to install them by the electric utility industry  in this country. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Bob, it's great to have your insights on all of this,  thanks so much.</p><p>MURRAY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob Murray.  We'll see you soon, sir.  Coming up, Twitter  gearing up to sell a billion dollars of new convertible debt.  We break  down the company's business strategy, next.  Then, Coca-Cola's new look,  check it out, where you can purchase the new clear zero calorie beverage,  coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Twitter preparing a $1-billion convert note  offerings.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with  more details on that, and the market that's going to open higher.  Hi,  Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, good morning to you, Maria.  That's  right, the Twitter taking advantage of the fact that the stock is sitting  at three-year highs, crossing through $40.00 apiece yesterday, and they're  about to join the S&amp;P 500, today, replacing Monsanto.  The only issue these  convertible bonds when your stock is sitting at a high valuation, basically  it converts debt into equity in the future, and Twitter, as we know, is on  a roll looking to make money in 2018 and reporting two straight profitable  quarters.  But so just to put it in context, a $40 apiece, we're still  sitting 45 percent its record high, back in 2013.  </p><p>And another story catching our attention this morning, and this is  blasphemy in my view, Coca-Cola Japan is launching a zero calorie,  colorless, lemon-flavored Coca-Cola.  That's right, it should be at the  caramel flavor and that's why it's colorless.  Coca-Cola Japan says they  aren't selling it anywhere else just yet but in my view, if you're going to  make it colorless and clear and lemon favor, Maria, just have a Sprite.   Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.</p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Susan.  We'll see you later.  Susan Li on the floor  of the NYSE.  California Republicans are feeling optimistic after this  week's primaries.  Joining us now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Good morning to you, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN ANCHOR:  I'm sorry, Maria, I'm just laughing at the  blasphemy comment --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Stu, she's right, have a Sprite.</p><p>VARNEY:  That was really good stuff right there.  OK.  Let's get to  California, frequently on this show, my show, your show, I've said, in my  lifetime, you'll never see a Republican elected to state-wide office in  California.  It's so blue, it ain't true.  I'm beginning to rethink that,  because I've taken a closer look at the primary results.  One primary --  no, one election in particular, you remember a guy called Josh Newman, he  is a state Senator, he's a Democrat, he represents a district in Orange  County.  He lost a recall vote by 18 points, and that was in a district  which Hillary Clinton had won by 13 points.  In other words, a Democrat  lost in heavily-Democrat territory and he was recalled.  Why did that  happen?  Because Mr. Newman promoted and voted for the gas tax increase in  California, which went into effect this year.  That has pushed the price of  gas to $0.80 a gallon, above the national average price, and Californians  don't like it.</p><p>My point here is that there is some scope here for the Republicans if and  when they exploit the gas tax issue, and they will exploit it, because John  Cox is the Republican Gubernatorial Candidate, and he organized this  reversal of the gas tax initiative that comes up in November.  My bottom  line here is, there's an opening here for Republicans in California, much  to my amazement. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is amazing.  It's true.  And John Cox did a good job in  terms of pointing out where Gavin Newsom was when all of these policies  went into effect, he basically encouraged them in terms of high taxes and  sanctuary, et cetera.</p><p>VARNEY:  Hope springs eternal for the Republicans in California.  Maybe  we're on to something, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks, Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.  </p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour right after MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart in 10 minutes' time.  But first, high-tech jewelry  that keeps women safe?  Details on a new device that triggers an emergency  alert when facing a threat, that's coming up.  As we take a break, smart  phone parts supplier are rallying on -- in the premarket this morning on  its deal with ZTE.  Take a look at all of them, up across the board.  Back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A high-tech way to keep women safe.  There is a  worldwide competition for teams of entrepreneurs building emergency alert  devices.  The goal to trigger first responders within 90 seconds of any  danger.  The Safety Pro (ph) from Leaf Wearables was announced as the  winner last night.  </p><p>Joining us right now are Naveen and Anu Jain.  Naveen, great to see you.   Anu, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>NAVEEN JAIN, CO-FOUNDER, WOMEN'S SAFETY XPRIZE:  Maria, it's already an  honor and pleasure to be with on your show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we are happy you're here.  This sounds really promising.   Tell us about the product.</p><p>N. JAIN:  Well, this is Anu's passion, so I'm going to let Anu talk about  this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us, Anu.</p><p>ANU JAIN, CO-FOUNDER, WOMEN'S SAFETY XPRIZE:  So, really excited.  We had  amazing solutions.  The goal was to really build an inconspicuous device  that we can put on ourselves, hide somewhere on us.  And when we're being  assaulted, we can basically send an emergency alert, and within 90 seconds,  we know that help is on the way.  And basically, even -- it'll work even in  areas of no connectivity and -- no connectivity, and, you know, you know  that help is on the way and it has to be affordable under $40.00 so that we  know it can be scaled across the world and available to all girls and women  around the world.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, the way the product works is when a woman feels in danger, she  presses a button on the device and first responders (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>A. JAIN:  Yes, yes.  So, it was fascinating to see the solution.  Some of  them had little, you know, whether it was a ring or a watch, you just press  a little button that sends a trigger --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the alert goes right to first responders?</p><p>A. JAIN:  So, the alert goes to basically a community of responders which  we have pre-set.  It could be family members, it could be friends, the  police, and some of the solutions actually were biosensors which were on --  touching your skin.  And one of them, actually, work with the breathing  pattern.  So, if you were being assaulted, your hands are tied, you just  breathe in a certain pattern and it automatically triggered the emergency  alert.  So, it was very cool.</p><p>N. JAIN:  You know, the best part really was that, you know, we didn't have  to really think about what the solutions would look like.  Once we defined  it, we actually care about this problem because it's so, you know,  prominent in the college campuses.  You know, people think there's  something that's happened in other countries, the third-world problem.  If  it is not of the United States problem, it's not a blue state problem, this  is a national problem.  It happens on our college campuses.  You know, we  have a daughter and we always wonder, you know, is she safe, until she gets  to the dorm room, we always wonder is she coming back. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are really no -- until now, there are no easy solutions to  contact first responders, number one.  But the alternative for women was to  -- you're going to carry mace where you got in your purse you can't get to  it.  A lot of communities you were not allowed to carry a gun.  You -- a  knife, (INAUDIBLE) got -- then, again, a lot of types are illegal, and this  is a way to make sure that you're keeping yourself safe.</p><p>A. JAIN:  Exactly, and it's totally inconspicuous.  I mean, the beauty of  the winners -- solution is it's the tiny chip, that really you can put --  you can put that in any part of your jewelry and make it a daily piece of  item that you wear all the time.  And, you know, the beauty is that it  works in an area where there is no connectivity.  So it doesn't matter  where you are.  You know that you are -- you'll have help on the way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you both partnered with XPRIZE?</p><p>N. JAIN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, tell us about XPRIZE.</p><p>N. JAIN:  So, we are both on the board of XPRIZE.  And again, the XPRIZE is  just a platform for incentive prizes.  Ideally, is that as a  philanthropist, you define what's the problem you actually care about.  And  in this case is we want to find a solution -- well, we don't know what it's  going to look like.  And the problem is, how do we find something that can  be cheap, affordable, and would work anywhere?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting stuff.  Congratulation to you both.</p><p>N. JAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anu, Naveen, great to see you.  Thank you so much for joining  us.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>A. JAIN:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anu and Naveen Jain, check it out.  We'll be right back right  here, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see everybody.  James Freeman, Mike Murphy, Dagen  McDowell.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  ZTE deserved to die.  Hope he got something good for the trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  We'll see about that.  We'll be following the ZTE  story throughout the day here on Fox Business.  Have a great day,  everybody.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now.  Here's Stuart.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

View original post here[2]. Former fund manager and FX trader Richard Breslow has an uncomfortable message for the investing world today: \"It's time to finally admit that fixed-income markets are the only ones capable of expressing an honest picture of the world.  And the picture they paint with 10-year Treasuries, bunds and JGBs at recession-level yields is something that can't any longer be blithely explained away as some technical distortion. \"   It doesn't matter to \u2014 or perhaps it is better to say it is crucially indicative of \u2014 underlying sentiment, that no matter how much of this stuff profligate governments will be issuing, investors feel the urgent need to have them in their portfolio. </p><p> Via Bloomberg, With all due respect to those positing much higher yields as a real risk given the hunky-dory view of the world from the large corner suite, we remain as mired in economic inequality as ever. With all of the threats that portends. And anxiety levels have not abated. I couldn't care less what some statistic that anyone wishes to cite claiming that it isn't true. Dr. Lawrence Summers wrotean interesting articlethat is running today on the Bloomberg terminal[3]. In it, he lays out the challenges political leaders must overcome to preserve in whole, or at least mostly, the post-war global Western hegemonic order.  In truth, we are sliding further and further away from achieving any of those goals. Suddenly locking in 3 percent yields doesn't seem so counterintuitive. Equities can go to the moon. With the sovereign wealth funds picking winners and losers among supposed competitors and putting public monies behind their choices, how far down is big tech really going to go? On the day that Apple hit its valuation milestone, I was looking at the list of owners of the shares and suddenly wasn't nearly as impressed. Buying back shares, touting 'adjusted earnings' and substituting M...or actual investment makes these markets great investments, but hardly indicative of economies putting the thoughts of future recessions out of everyone's minds. There were three stories I read yesterday that really got me going. A great read about a well-deserved victory lap byMorgan Stanleyfor having called a month ago the big-tech correction. In it they say that, after making the out-of-consensus prediction, their phones 'were not ringing'. Apparently, the pull of confirmation bias precluded clients from wanting to hear another opinion. Is it true that you can't be fired if you maintain that everyone you talked to agreed with the position? Anyway, as the sell-off took place, 'inbound traffic picked up considerably'. This story is indicative of so much.  The second story was about Facebook wanting to team up with banks and share information to offer customer-service products. The shares of the company and the financial sector as a whole rose. How quickly we all forget. I know the first question I would ask the next time a banking regulator testifies that we are being too harsh.  Lastly, I was reading the gruesome accounts of the diplomatic blow-up between Canada and Saudi Arabia. It was appalling that so much of the analysis focused on what this could cost in trade. Concluding, it was affordable. I'm sure this is not what Keynes meant when he argued about the primacy of economics in guiding the world forward.   Since it has been a day of rethinking things, I've got another. As one dollar bull to another. The charts just won't be convinced this thing is going anywhere anytime soon. The trading range of DXY, with its multiple tops, is just too compelling to ignore.  And the broader Bloomberg Dollar Index looks like it has already decided the rally has played out for now. Back to the drawing board.

We're going to say good morning to Maria Bartiromo.  Good to  see you.  Welcome back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there ladies, thanks so  much.  Great to be back.  Good morning everybody, welcome back from the  summertime.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday September  4th.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors have a lot to keep their eyes on this week between waiting for a  trade deal with Canada and expected tariffs on more Chinese goods.  Plus,  news on the political front.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures this morning showing the markets will open mix.  Dow Industrials  down about 20 points right now.  Fractional moves on the upside though for  the S&amp;P500, up almost one point and the NASDAQ up eight and a half right  now.</p><p>This after a mixed close on Friday for the major indices, take a look at  Friday's performance, August, still finishing in the green though despite  Friday's decline of about 22 points on the Dow.  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ were up  as you can see.  The Dow adding just over two percent for the month of  August, the S&amp;P500 was up three percent for the month of August, and the  NASDAQ is the big winner with an additional 5.7 percent move for the month  of August alone.</p><p>Check out markets in Europe this morning, take a look, we are looking at a  down session with the FT-100 down 11 points, CAC Quarante down about 55,  better than one percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down almost one  percent despite reports that President Trump is ready to drop another round  of tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods as early as this week.</p><p>Asian markets finished mostly in positive territory overnight with the  exception of Japan.  Nikkei Average down just marginally.</p><p>Here comes the judge, Brett Kavanaugh is set to be begin Senate  confirmation hearings today, this as the Trump Administration announced  that it will withhold more than 100,000 pages of documents on Kavanaugh.   They say that the documents are protected by constitutional privilege.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  His records speaks for itself.  So those  who raise questions now about 100,000 documents, et cetera, that they'd  like to see when he works for the White House years ago, you know, that's  just an attempt to slowdown the proceedings to embarrass him.  But his  record is going to carry him through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The administration did release more than 42,000 pages on  Kavanaugh just yesterday.  </p><p>Extreme weather to report, Tropical Storm Gordon is now barrowing toward  the Gulf Coast.  The very latest on Gordon's move.</p><p>Then outrage after Colin Kaepernick was named the new face of Nike, the  backlash coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it  all down, our own Dagen McDowell.  The Wall Street Journal's Global  Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.  And Kings College Business and Economics  Professor Brian Brenberg.  Great to see you.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning.  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from the summer.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to be back.  I missed you.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I missed you so much.  But  you're the hardest worker and woman in the news business, so you deserve  some time off.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I am dying to hear what you think about everything that's  going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much going on.  Jon, it's good to see you again.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It is good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot on the economic front as well.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Lot to talk about on trade.  We have a great story on paper  today on the dairy market.  I was going to send this to you over the  weekend Dagen.  A good points and hypocrisy on both sides about dairy  trade, is it the center of U.S.-Canada trade arguments right now?  And both  sides are rigging our dairy markets, so we should -- and our viewers should  take a look at that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And look what I've printed out this morning, \"Why Milk Matters?\"   The U.S. and Canada trade fight.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I knew Dagen was going to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There is apparently a -- again, this is why it's not that big of  a stumbling block I don't think in the -- in the negotiations with Canada  to be part of the NAFTA rewrite because we actually benefit from the  current policy in Canada.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We're running a trade surplus.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  $650 million trade surplus on dairy.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We're actually dumping surplus milk into Canada and we want to  be able to dump more.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see.  I mean, the -- a deal with Mexico is, what, a  handshake?  I mean, it's done.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will Canada follow up soon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, that's the big question.  And then there was an  interesting episode last week where the president had an interview with  Bloomberg News and somehow it leaked out.  He -- where he made some  comments off the record saying he's not going to give Canada any ground  whatsoever and they either have to take it or leave, so let's see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing that Jon pointed out last week though that in order to  get fast-track status on this trade and that is pass it with just a simple  majority instead of 60 votes in the Senate, Canada according to, like,  Senator Toomey for example, he says among others that Canada has to be part  of it to get fast-track approval.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And the president was tweeting about this week --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Congress has to sign off on this.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- he was tweeting to Congress, \"Stay out of this, take  whatever deal I give you.\"  Or else -- he's saying he's going to pull out  of all these trade deals.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But the fact is it makes zero sense from Canada's perspective to  not get something done.  If they didn't get something done, they would be  the big losers in this.  That's why ultimately I think they'll come the  president's way and get something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very important point.  I think I agree with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's why dairy matters so much because if they get the wrong  side of the dairy deal, it's a very politically powerful industry and  particularly in Quebec and we'll have to see how much they dig their heels  in on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got a lot on that coming up, that's one of the key  stories of course.  Joining the conversation this morning, St. Louis  Federal Reserve President and CEO James Bullard is here.  Of course, we got  a Federal Reserve meeting this month and we are expecting rates to move  higher again.</p><p>House Judiciary Committee Member, California Congressman Darrell Issa is  with us this morning, along with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.   Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz here as well.  Big three  hours ahead, don't miss moments of it.</p><p>Let's kick it off right here with this top story this hour and that is on  the hot seat, Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh goes before the Senate  Judiciary Committee later this morning.  That will set off a partisan  battle over what is a consequential lifetime appointment.  </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham a member of the Judiciary Committee sounding off and  confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed potentially with democratic  votes as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does he have the votes to win confirmation of the  court?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  If he does  well at the hearing he will get -- my belief is he does well and I'm sure  he will do well.  I think there are a handful of democrats who will vote  for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know Dagen, you've got democrats from states that Trump won  which people are expecting those states, those democrats actually vote yes  for Kavanaugh, what do you say?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are 10 democratic senators up for re-election in states  that President Trump won.  Half of those Trump won those states by double  digits.  The three to watch particularly are Joe Manchin in West Virginia,  Joe Donnelly in Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota.</p><p>Why are we watching these three democrats?  Because they all voted for Neil  Gorsuch.  They were the three senators who stepped up and gave a thumbs up  to Gorsuch.  But as the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page points out in a  lengthy editorial titled, \"The Kavanaugh Hazing\" that democrats are going  to use these hearings to try and drive people to the polls and try and  drive votes coming up on the midterms.  And they are going to portray a  nightmare scenario that this man is put on the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And they're raising the question of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Something that's been in place for 50 years which people are  not expecting to -- has any movement whatsoever.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Well -- and they're making this huge think about documents and  access to documents which has really nothing to do this -- with this.  When  you think about somebody who's been the district court for 12 years, has  300 opinions under his belt, you know where he stands.</p><p>It's not hard to assess where he is, that's not the point for democrats,  they simply want to score points in the midterm election and they're going  to use this week as a grandstand to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love -- I love this outrage --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's right.  I think this -- this question of Roe v. Wade is  an important one.  You know, the rally big issue for a lot of people is  will he uphold the presidents of the court or will he be willing to move  them in another direction not just on Roe v. Wade but also on gay marriage.   I think that's where he's going to be pressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But hasn't he made suggestions already that he's not interested  in changing something that's been in place for 650 years?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It sounds like -- it sounds like he has --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- in closed door meetings and now we have to see --</p><p>BRENBERG:  And it's a -- and it's a John Roberts Court.  He's not going to  move the court.  He cares very much about presidents.  So, for that very  reason I think it's less of an issue than democrats are making (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this outrage over the documents.  Meanwhile, we're still  waiting on documents from the FBI and the DOJ.  Congress is still waiting  on all these documents for a year and a half right now and yet there's all  this outrage over the documents over Brett Kavanaugh.  And then there's --  go ahead Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I was just going to say that -- so we -- on Trump  Administration withheld 101,000 document pages entirely under executive  privilege.  Senators and their staff were allowed to view 147,000 or so in  a secure room on Capitol Hill.  This is very similar to how the Obama White  House handled the documents for Elena Kagan when she was up for Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a good point.  That's a very good point.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think there's two issues on the documents, one is he was a  staff secretary.  My understanding of that job is you control documents,  your whole job is deciding what -- how documents are managed.  So you could  basically ask for all White House documents that came through his desk.   That's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Chuck Grassley did the -- but when he was the staff  secretary in the White House, Chuck Grassley I do not believe actually asks  for those documents to be even turned over because they would be under  executive public.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But then there's another issue of how the -- how the U.S.  treated prisoners and the whole war against Islamic terror, there's some  questions on the democratic side about what position he took in the states.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why they want to see the document.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And that's where -- I think that's where the -- a lot of  contention is.</p><p>BRENBERG:  But --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To your point, what these -- what the justices look at in terms  of overturning why they will never overturn some of these major decisions  because they look at, I think the legal term is (INAUDIBLE) where it's  become part of our social fabric and the way that we live our lives.</p><p>Like Roe v. Wade for example or even Miranda, this is something the Journal  writes about that Justice William Rehnquist was a critic of the 1966  decision but in 2000 he refused a chance to overturn the Miranda ruling  because it become -- it had been universally in use for so long.  So it  becomes part of our everyday lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A part of the legal process.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But you see why when he said --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he said that repeatedly that this has been in place, he's  not interested in changing something that's been in place for 50 years.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But that matters a lot to social conservatives.  Don't they  want -- don't social conservatives want to hear him say, \"Yes, I am going  to move on Roe v. Wade.\"  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So I think everybody wants to hear what he has to say on it.</p><p>BRENBERG:  I think the left is upset because they like to use the Supreme  Court as a super congressional body to make law instead of interpret law.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>BRENBERG:  And they know Kavanaugh is not somebody who will allow that to  happen.  It's not about what's happened in the past, it's about what they  won't be able to get done in the future that's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's such an important point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If democrats -- in -- if democrats in Congress want to make law  that is progressive, then make law.  Do not use the court to do that --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Pass it through Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to do that on your behalf because you're position is so weak  you could never pass a law basically pushing us to the left.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  That's the central issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well all of this comes up this morning.  The hearing begins I  guess just after nine or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  9:30a.m. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  9:30a.m. this morning.  We will obviously have it live here for  you, so stay with us on those hearings.</p><p>Turning to technology, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as well as Facebook's Chief  Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are going to be testifying tomorrow in  front of these Senate Intel Committee.  They will answer questions about  foreign use of social media to influence elections.</p><p>Separately, Mr. Dorsey will testify before the House Commerce Committee as  you heard here first regarding the tribute of conservative voices on  Twitter.  Let's talk about this, what are we going to hear tomorrow from  these technology chiefs tomorrow and from both of these --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, they're going to get it from every side.  Conservatives  feel, you know, that the conservative voices are being repressed on social  media.  Democrats are concerned about, you know, about Russian meddling and  other meddling.  So I think it's going to be -- it's going to be a tough  couple of days for these executives.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know it's interesting because conservatives usually do not  want to see more government, more regulation in business, in free  enterprise.  And yet, these companies have become so big and so powerful  more so than they expected initially, so what do you do?</p><p>BRENBERG:  And they shouldn't want to see more involvement from the  government here.  But the problem is with Twitter especially, it looks like  Dorsey is stepping in at the last moment and making decisions.</p><p>They don't have a process, they don't have clear guidelines, it looks  personality-driven and conservatives look at that and say the personalities  at the top are progressive liberal and that's why our voices are being --  are suffering here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're going to -- they're going to have to explain how they  actually do decide when to take somebody off the platform.  Dorsey's going  to have to explain in detail how his platform actually ban certain voices,  right?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And, you know -- and there's also the whole issue of privacy  of how they're letting information out to -- you know, to the public.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How they make money off the backs of people's most private  personal information because I don't think -- like particularly with  Google.  Google has a lot of explaining to do and I don't think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They keep blowing off the invitations, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I don't think -- it's a question as to who shows up  because Sundar Pichai that Senator Burr wanted the CEO of Google there,  he's not going.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's some question as to whether Larry Page shows up, that  remains to be seen, one of the two founders of Google.  But again, how much  access they have to -- our -- the way that we behave online.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we know they have a lot of access to it Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The interesting --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know that, you know, there are certain things that have been  taken off these platforms and you have to scratch your head and say, why?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I don't think this story is going away.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No way.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's going to be with us -- it's going to be with us for a  while and who knows if it ends up in some kind of anti-trust movement  either in Congress or out of --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To break these companies up because they're too big.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  To -- that's one thing.  And then there's the question of, you  know, rules of how they -- of how they deal with -- of how they deal with  privacy and private (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'll -- but one thing I'll add because I raise this issue  because Congress quite frankly let Facebook as one example get to the size  that it is with the acquisition of, say, Instagram, number one. </p><p>Number two, it's interesting that Amazon is now moving deeper into the  advertising space giving potentially Google a run for its money.  That's  really one thing that will also at the power of these platforms is if you  have a lot more competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And there was one search engine that raised millions is  recently DuckDuckGo.  So you're seeing an effort at competition because  that's what people would like, competition, as opposed to regulation.</p><p>BRENBERG:  And ultimately that's the best regulator.  But what's been  interesting is we've been talking about this for a very long time.  The big  tech names have not been able to inspire confidence.  They've been very bad  upon their story that's why they're in this position right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Think until you make it.  It's in their entire mantra.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Not very good at faking it anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And, you know -- and, again, it come to bite them in the, well,  where the sun doesn't shine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got a lot coming up.  Keep it right here for the  live coverage of all of that, the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings starts at  9:30 this morning and then, of course, tomorrow on the technology  testimonies as well.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  When we come back, bracing for impact, Tropical  Storm Gordon is now gaining strength as it marches toward the Gulf.  We've  got the very latest on the hurricane warning now in effect.</p><p>And then Nike take sides, the backlash after the company taps Colin  Kaepernick for its Just Do It Campaign, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Bracing for impact, Gulf Coast states on high  alert this morning as Tropical Storm Gordon is expected to strengthen into  a hurricane.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning Maria.  Gordon  bearing down on the Gulf Coast overnight lashing South Florida with heavy  rains and high winds.  The storm expected to turn into a hurricane later  today when it makes landfall.</p><p>Gordon whipping winds at 60 miles per hour causing flash flooding.  Storm  surge warnings also in effect right now, a hurricane warning put into  effect as far north as Mississippi.  As much as eight inches of rain could  fall in some parts of the Gulf States through late Thursday which we should  say that some of those rigs are already being shut down in the Gulf.  Those  oil rigs that, of course, watch here.</p><p>Well, billionaire CEO of JD.com Richard Liu is now back in China after  being released by police in Minneapolis.  He was arrested late Friday on  suspicion of sexual misconduct.  Details of the allegations have not been  released and Liu is denying the claims.  Police say the investigation is  considered active and they are intense reactions in China.</p><p>News outlets and social media are certainly talking about his arrest.   China's foreign minister says it is looking into the circumstances  surrounding his arrest.  JD.com is China's second largest online shopping  site after Alibaba.  Shares of the company trading lower by down -- down by  more than three percent right now in the premarket actually.</p><p>Well, Nike is feeling the heat after naming former quarterback Colin  Kaepernick the face of its 30th Just Do It Campaign.  The new ad features  the line \"Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.\"   Nike customers are clearly not happy about the company getting political</p><p>Many videos being shared on social media, show people burning their Nike  shoes as you can see in this video, that's one instance of many.  But Nike,  they're standing by their decision.  They say, \"We believe Colin is one of  the most inspirational athletes of this generation who has leveraged the  power of sports to help move the world forward.\"</p><p>Kaepernick hasn't played in the NFL since the 2016 season, folks, when he  began protesting on the field during the national anthem.  And to kick it  off, shares of Nike are down in the premarket, down more than half a  percent Maria.  Big news at Nike, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Coming up, stock soaring  to new highs, will the market run continue into autumn?  We're breaking  down what's important for markets coming up next.  We got a Federal Reserve  meeting coming up this month.</p><p>Then liberal backlash, the New Yorker uninviting Steve Bannon from its  festival after a celebrity outcry.  What Bannon is saying now, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a lot happening in the couple of months  ahead, that could be impactful for the market.  Wall Street rallying as  stocks are at.  We're near record highs heading into the first trading day  of the month.</p><p>Some investors though are fearing that the market could trade down in  September, a historical volatile stretch for global markets.  Joining us  right now to walk through the catalyst for stocks, Mark Lehman is JMP  Securities President.  Mark, it's good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>MARK LEHMAN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's going to be the big catalyst in your view for the  markets in the fourth quarter?</p><p>LEHMAN:  Well, you're going to see obviously third quarter earnings which  will be interesting.  You're going to see a bunch of IPOs.  Post Labor Day  you're going to see filing after filing.  We saw one last week with  SurveyMonkey which will obviously be an important bell weather for the tech  market.</p><p>But you also have trade talks and, of course, 60 days away with the midterm  elections.  So there's lots to things for investors to be excited about and  plenty for them to be worried about.</p><p>BRENBERG:  We keep talking about trade and how it's going to affect markets  and yet all summer the story has been, markets have shrugged.  Why do you  think they're going to care potentially coming up here in the fall or is it  going to be another case where we think it's a big deal and it's not?</p><p>LEHMAN:  Well, I think like most things we've been in kind of the denial  and anger phase for a little bit.  That's the way we start things and we're  in the middle of kind of figuring things out.  I think we're going to find  out after a quarter or two of how these tariffs are looking and obviously  between Canada and Mexico we're not quite sure how that's going to look in  their biggest trade partners.</p><p>I think it's clarity comes into those places.  But right now business is  pretty good, I think people are on the sidelines deciding how it's going to  -- how they're going to react.  But I think right now we're still in the  figuring out phase.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Mark, we know that 2018 earnings numbers are really good, you  know, well into the double digits.  What's 2019 looking like?  What's 2020  looking like on the earnings front?</p><p>LEHMAN:  You know, I think '19 -- this has been such a good year, you have  such a good response from the tax cuts at least from earnings perspective.   I think expecting a little bit of a down draft year-over-year.  It's a lot  large numbers will probably cause earnings to come down and expectations to  be tempered.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how these numbers turn out.  Obviously, '18  was supposed to be a good year, not a great year but it's been turn --  turning into a great year for earnings.  I would expect '19 to be temper  and we'll see how Wall Street reacts.  Seeing the three percent bond or seeing an umbrella of a three percent bond  puts a I think a real catalyst for earnings because that low rate continues  to make people want to put more money in equities and I think that will  continue into the fall and in 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this has been the stock market rally that has had more  naysayers than I can remember in recent history, people who have been  doubters all along.  The Wall Street Journal on its front page today talks  about how global fund managers are holding higher than average levels of  cash in their portfolios.</p><p>And even some major investment banks like Morgan Stanley have already  recommended trimming their technology allocations.  So that bodes well for  the market the fact that people are what -- so worried about it.</p><p>LEHMAN:  Well, you know, you can -- I've been on this show, I've called it  the most disrespected bull market in history.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>LEHMAN:  I think having people who don't believe ascribe to the high enough  to buy theory of stocks which obviously I don't know that's Warren Buffett.   I mean, people will have to have exposure and people are those fund  managers you talk about are not supposed to be a fund manager of cash,  they're supposed to money inactively manage it.</p><p>And I think as these stocks trade higher and earnings continue to  accelerate you will see more of that belief and I think you're going to see  more of that into the fall.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Isn't that skepticism a great thing?  I mean the last two  expansions were short circuited by over exuberance.  If we have under  exuberance right now, isn't that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was my point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But that's what -- </p><p>LEHMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) no, I look -- I have been very --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  Really, he made it better than I did.</p><p>LEHMAN:  Right.  Well -- and listen --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But look at all these uncertainty that a Federal Reserve  meeting this month the were expecting that the Fed raises rates in  September, correct?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Uh-hmm.  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got the midterm elections which can go either way, and  of course, the uncertainty about trade.  </p><p>LEHMAN:  It's true.  And I think people have continued to look at tech as  kind of anomalous and tech is not anomalous.  You know, people look at  Amazon and saying, \"Wow, it's one of the great companies\" or \"Apple is one  of the great companies.\"</p><p>Apple is far from being just a tech company, it's a healthcare company,  it's an autonomous company, it's an entertainment company, it's a media  company.  You have all these parts of it and people are not really paying  attention of the fact that these are much bigger than the narrowness of a  tech company.</p><p>And I think you'll see this in the fall, you're going to see, again,  SurveyMonkey's one of the companies, you're going to see a bunch of  companies that you really want to pay attention to because that's where the  growth of the economy is and the growth of the markets and I think you're  going to continue to see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If you have all the supply, doesn't that hurt markets in terms  of performance?</p><p>LEHMAN:  Well, supply obviously is having that despite of any imbalances  there.  But listen, you have plenty of M&amp;A going on, you have lots of that  already relative to previous peaks that we've been a part of.  This is  nothing compared to an IPO market in the past, nothing at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I'll add really quickly, Sam Stovall said on the --  this program last week that in the fourth quarter of midterm election years  the S&amp;P on average is up 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter and it's up 90  percent of the time.  And that's some -- once that uncertainty falls away.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  From his mouth.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's amazing that the third the third quarter is up in just a  couple of weeks.</p><p>LEHMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the earnings period will likely be dictating performance.   Mark, great to have you.  Thank you so much, good to see you always.</p><p>LEHMAN:  Thanks so much.  Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mark Lehman joining us there.  Coming up, the founder of the  notorious Taliban linked Haqqani network now dead.  What it means for the  war in terror in Afghanistan.</p><p>Plus, no college diploma, no problem.  Apparently more big companies like  Apple among others ditching college degree requirements for jobs, the  impact next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, September 4th,  your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Trade under President Trump, investors are reacting to the future of  America's trade policies with Canada and China, the two uncertainties right  now.  </p><p>Futures are currently mixed.  Take a look, indicating the market will open  with the Dow, down about 20 points and the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ higher by  a fraction.  The Dow Industrials finishing lower on Friday, falling 22  points at the close, with the NASDAQ up 21 at the close.</p><p>This coming as the NASDAQ posted the biggest gain in August in 18 years.   It was a good month for the month of August, for the NASDAQ, as you can  see.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  Take a look,  FT-100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris, down better  than one percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, down almost one percent.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of  Japan.  It was down just a fraction.  </p><p>Fighting for his life, a Georgia police officer is shot while responding to  a shoplifting report at a Wal-Mart, the very latest developments, coming  up.</p><p>Plus, a dis-invitation for Steve Bannon, the New Yorker Festival is  dropping the former White House Chief Strategist after celebrities like Jim  Carrey, Judd Apatow said they would not participate if Bannon remained on  the schedule, the backlash, coming up.</p><p>And no college degree no problem, we're breaking down the major hiring  shift for big-technology companies later this hour, where college degree  may not be required any longer.</p><p>All that coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an  hour, the war on terror continues this morning, the Taliban, announcing  earlier this morning that the leader of the notorious Haqqani network has  died.</p><p>This comes as unnamed U.S. service member was killed in Afghanistan, and  what the military is describing, as an insider attack, one other member was  wounded.  </p><p>Joining me to discuss that is retired four-star general, Fox News Senior  Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure,  good to see you this morning.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good to  see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the developments here, the fact that this  leader is now dead, does that change anything?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, he's been an iconic leader for some time, he's been sick,  he's elderly, he was paralyzed and he really was not involved in day to day  operations.  He turned that over to his son a year ago.  But if anything,  you know, his death just further commits the ideological fighters that the  Haqqani people are, you know, to this -- to this cause that they have.  </p><p>And so they're going to continue.  This network has been a real thorn on  the side of Afghanistan and U.S. forces ever since 2001.  And the problem  is that they take up residence inside Pakistan, in north western Pakistan,  is where their bases are, and it's from those bases that they attack into  Afghanistan and conduct operations against U.S. and Afghan forces.</p><p>They are responsible for most of these horrific suicide bombings that take  place in Kabul.  Recently, some of that has been done by ISIS, but over  these last 17 years, Haqqani has done most of all of that.  </p><p>Our problem has been this, Maria, we have never attacked the Haqqani  network the way we did the Al-Qaeda network, which is also in north western  Pakistan, why?  Because the Pakistanis refused to let us do that, why is  that?  Because they absolutely support the Haqqani network, their  intelligence service supports them.  </p><p>We have evidence of the military providing training for them, they've given  them logistics, they've given them resources, and this has been a horrific  thing for 17 years.  We are on our third president trying to do something  about that, the past two failed miserably.  This network continues to  thrive and they continue to kill Afghans and Afghan people and U.S.  soldiers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the state of this network, of ISIS right now, for a  year and a half, we have been talking about ISIS being on the run.  But  recently, we're seeing issues of, in certain corners, where they are back,  and now you've got this Taliban-linked network as well.  Where are we, in  the state, in terms of against terrorism, right now?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, well, first of all, the Al-Qaeda network is thriving and ISIS  is thriving outside of Syria and Iraq, we did take their territory away  from them.  That was something that had to be done because that was a major  recruiting tool for them and also a place where they could direct actions  in other parts.  </p><p>There's 30 affiliates that are outside of Syria and Iraq, and there's one  that is a growing menace inside of Afghanistan.  The Al-Qaeda itself, still  -- their headquarters are still in north western Pakistan, and they have  other networks in Africa, a significant one in Syria that they're about to  conduct campaigns against.  </p><p>But the radical Islamist Global Jihad is out there and is doing well.   We've been at this for 17 years and the fact is, if we are totally honest  with ourselves, despite all of our efforts this -- there has been expansion  in their capabilities over these years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Let me -- let me zero in on Syria, because the President  has made it clear, this weekend, he will not tolerate an assault from  President Bashar al-Assad and his allies on rebel fighters in the Idlib  Province.  </p><p>Here's yesterday's tweet from the President and he says, President Bashar  al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province.  The Russians  and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in  this potential human tragedy.  Hundreds of thousands of people could be  killed.  Don't let that happen.  The President writes.</p><p>This comes after Iran's foreign minister said that terrorists must be  purged from the region.  What do you make of the President's strategy in  such a volatile region?</p><p>KEANE:  You know, what's happening here has set the -- set the framework  for everybody.  The Iranians and the Russians successfully propped up the  Assad regime.  And what they've been doing -- and that began with the  Russians in 2015.  And what they've been doing this last year or so, is  consolidating those gains.  </p><p>And this is one of the last opposition forces strongholds in Idlib  Province.  The problem is, there are about 3 million people and residents  there.  Now, these fighters are largely Al-Qaeda fighters and there's about  10,000 of them strong, and some other few thousands of other fighters there  as well.  </p><p>This is -- this is the most fiercest, toughest of the opposition forces  that the Assad regime will have to deal with and that's why they have put  this off as long as they have.  The Turks are also trying to deter this  from happening and they moved some forces down into northern Syria.</p><p>The President is using some rhetoric to do that.  But to be frank about it,  we have very little leverage, in Syria, to stop this.  They're in the  planning and preparation phase, I do believe they eventually will execute  this at some point.  We will know when the campaign begins because the  bombing will begin.  </p><p>And believe me, the Russians do most of the bombing in Syria, they've been  doing that for well over a year now.  And their way of war here is the same  way that Putin made war in Chechnya, in a place called Grozny, the inside  of Chechnya in 2000.  </p><p>And that is to go in there, where conventional bombs and eliminate as much  of the population as possible, thereby depriving the terrorists as they  call them, or insurgence from support from the people and obviously,  killing terrorists as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KEANE:  But the objective for the Russians will be as it is for Assad, to  go kill as many people as we possibly can, destroy their homes, destroy  their facilities, destroy their hospitals, destroy their warehouses, taking  much all of their quality of life away from them, and thus -- therefore,  dry up the terrorist support that they're getting from the people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still, such an incredibly dangerous situation, General.  Let me  switch gears because this week, one of the big issues will likely be the  trade issues between China and the U.S., we actually could see the U.S.  impose that additional $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, this  Thursday, the 6th, and we are waiting on that.</p><p>What's your take on where we are with China and also the trade story around  Canada as the U.S. successfully does a deal with Mexico, and now awaits  China's -- Canada's participation, rather, so China and Canada, the  unknowns?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  Well, I think the major issue certainly is China.  Canada is  a major trading partner as well.  But I generally agree that taking on  these trade imbalances is the right thing to do and try to fix some of it  as much as possible.</p><p>We've obviously had some success with the European Union.  We'll have to  see the final result of that, at least that's been the goal, the goal to  zero tariffs that would be really something that we could do  internationally, unlikely to be sure.</p><p>But listen, China has been conducting economic warfare on the United States  and our allies for years and it's about time that somebody is calling them  on this, not just the trade imbalance but the incredible amount of  intellectual property theft, the incredible amount of cyber espionage  that's taking place.  </p><p>We are on a collision course with China, not just economically, but also in  terms of what their militarization of the Western Pacific, their  geopolitical goals, all at the expense of the -- of the United States.  The  president maintains public diplomacy, you know, President Xi is my friend,  we've got a great relationship.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  And that's fine, but the team that's working beneath him, his  economic team, and also his national security team, very clear eyed about  China, they know that they are a major obstacle to the United States  interest around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obstacles, but now, also an issue for the North Korea story, so  now we know for sure that the trade issues between the U.S. and China have  begun to impact the general discussion about denuclearization in North  Korea, China teaming up with North Korea, and the President basically  calling back Pompeo from even going to North Korea because of it.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, that occurs as a result of some original letter we received  from the North Korean official prior to the visit, and the President read  that attitude as much as he saw an attitude change just prior to the  Singapore Summit and he cancelled it.</p><p>He's using that cancellation of the visit as leverage.  We'll see if that  attitude changes.  We are just waiting for the North Koreans to do  something positive on denuclearization, which they have not done to date.   And I think that we'll give them a little bit more rope there.  </p><p>But the President and his team are running out of rope, frankly, and after  a number of weeks, they are going to have to start slapping sanctions,  harder sanctions on North Korea.  And here is the big one, because China  has opened up the aperture and has provided some sanction relief to North  Korea ever since the Singapore Summit.  </p><p>If they don't stop that, we'll going to have to sanction China as well,  we'll have to go after some of their banking systems.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, all right, more will be revealed here.  General, it's good  to talk to you as always.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, a Georgia police officer  is fighting for his life this morning, after being shot in the head while  responding to a shoplifting call at Wal-Mart, the very latest on his  condition, coming up.  </p><p>Then, liberal backlash, the New Yorker uninviting Steve Bannon from its  festival, after celebrities outcries, what Bannon is now saying, next, back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, a police officer is fighting for his life this  morning after he was shot in the head.  Cheryl Casone with the details,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Maria, 34-year-old officer Matt Cooper was responding to a call of  men shoplifting bandanas at a Walmart, near Atlanta.  He was shot while he  was chasing a suspect across the street.  The suspect then killed himself;  two others are in custody.  The six-year veteran on the force is in serious  condition this morning.  He's also an army veteran, a husband, and a father  of two.  </p><p>Well, Steve Bannon has been dropped from the annual New Yorker festival  after liberal outrage.  The former White House adviser was disinvited from  the event after several celebrities, including Jim Carry, Patton Oswalt,  and Judd Apatow said they would boycott the festival if Bannon showed up.   Well, Bannon responded in a statement, he called David Remnick, the Editor  of the New Yorker gutless.  </p><p>Well, \"Crazy Rich Asians\" continues to dominate theaters for third weekend  in a row.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We can't afford this.  So, your family is rich.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're comfortable.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That is exactly what a super-rich person would say.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The movie brought in just over $22 million.  Its domestic gross  now totals over 110 million -- forget the global box office, it's bigger.   Also, for the third weekend in a row, \"The Meg\" made $10.5 million.  That  scary thriller is still doing well.  Third place, \"Mission Impossible:  Fallout\" with $7 million.  Rounding up the top five: \"Operation Finale\" and  \"Searching,\" each earned about 6 million.  Maria, back to \"Mission  Impossible: Fallout\" topped the international box office this weekend.   $77.3 million in China, global take at 649. Tom Cruise is 56-years-old,  maybe this bodes for the \"Top Gun\" sequel that's going to be coming out  soon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  I got to see \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" that  is good.  </p><p>CASONE:  I know.  Me too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, no college diploma, apparently  no problem.  More big companies such as Google, Apple, they're ditching  college degree requirements for jobs.  We've got that story coming up right  after this short break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  No diploma, no problem, apparently.  More and  more companies are scrapping degree requirements for jobs those degrees of  college.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now, Lauren. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hey, great to see you.  I know.  No B.A., no problem is what  the companies are saying.  They're not saying don't go get a college  degree, they're just saying if you don't have one, it's not going to be a  barrier for you to work in certain jobs at our company.  So, what are these  15 major companies that's saying no B.A. is totally fine?  Nordstrom, Bank  of America, (INAUDIBLE), Apple, Google, IBM, you might not expect to see  some of those names on that list, and they're doing this as we get the  August job report -- it comes down on Friday.  But we do have the numbers  from July.  The national unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, it is going down  and it is going down among those who do not have college degrees.  </p><p>If you look at those with high school diplomas, the unemployment rate in  July went down to four percent.  And if you look at those with less than a  high school diploma, it went from one year ago, seven percent to 5.1  percent now.  That's not terrible.  The big question is why is this  happening?  Is it that college is too expense with the average tuition and  fees for private school about $32,000 and we're graduating with a combined,  what, $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, or is it that -- and you might  know the answer to this, Brian -- the colleges aren't preparing and  training the students (INAUDIBLE) as workers, whether it's coding, or some  of the vocational skills, have we lowered our standards, what's the problem  right now?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're a college professor.  You can't be happy about this.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  No, actually I am happy about it.  Because, look, the fact is,  for many, many students they're going to college for four, five, six years.   If they're getting out, when they're getting out with a degree, they don't  have the skills that employers want and employers are just saying, if we're  going through that process and you're going to spend that kind of money?   Forget about it.  Come work for us.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, it's the school's problems.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Yes.  I mean, in so many cases, these degree programs aren't  preparing them to add value in the workplace, they're not teaching how to  be good professionals, they are sitting in classrooms, they're hearing  ideological rants; walking with a distorted view of reality.  Come on, why  would a company want to hire somebody like that? </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, not only that, but they're taking on thousands and  thousands and thousands of dollars of debt --</p><p>BRENBERG:  Which makes it even worse.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- to get all of that.  And I think a lot of people on the  worker side are saying, do I need to go through all of this and take on all  of this debt to be prepared for the workplace?  But on the other side I  think, you know, you said there's a 3.9 percent unemployment rate.  That is  really the crux of the whole thing; the worker shortages in industries all  across the economy and companies are saying, well, you know, maybe we don't  need college graduates for this job or that job, maybe we need to broaden  our horizon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.  Big worker shortage right now in truck drivers.   Amazon needs truck drivers.  Construction.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Home care aid.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Even financial advisers.  As people get older, as this  generation gets older, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been an advocate for -- my brother and I, for years, have  had this conversation, if we could go back and do it again we would out of  high school try to go and work for a major corporation and get on the job  training.  Because ultimately, it keeps you -- people are literally  spending a quarter of a million dollars for an education and social  justice, and gender pronounce.  That's what they -- that's what the people  at these liberal arts colleges are worried about.  And if more of these  technology companies start educating people right out of high school, find  smart kids and basically make them sign a contract say, you know, we'll  teach you -- give you on the job training, you're going to work here for  five years and you can go up and do whatever you want.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Having said all of this -- Brian, I'm sure you can speak to  this, the research shows, unequivocally, that people with college degrees  fare much better in life.  Your lifetime earnings are much higher if you  have a college degree than if you --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really important point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- encouraging people to skip college altogether.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  That doesn't imply causation; it's the reason they're getting  these jobs because they went to college, would they get them anyway.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  All good questions.  Lauren, great to see you.   Thank you so much, Lauren Simonetti.  Still ahead, Nike takes side.

Burning right into the fall here with the Kavanaugh  hearings this week, right.  No stalling here, straight into it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real busy.  We'll see.  And they're supposed to get Democratic  support, but we'll see.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Big  week.  We also have the jobs report coming up, end of the week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting?  Another good number -- Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  More good numbers.  Yes.  I mean there's no evidence out there  that, you know, the economy is slowing down.  So -- </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  -- which I said on  \"OUTNUMBERED\" yesterday, loudly.</p><p>It's incredible what the job market's been able to do this year because the  first seven months of the year job growth on average every month is  actually faster than it was the seven months -- the first seven months of  last year which deep into an expansion is pretty incredible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest  rates next meeting -- September 26th -- we are expecting a hike in rates.</p><p>And of course, then we've got third quarter earnings on tap, amazing that  the third quarter is over in just three weeks and then we'll have the  earnings period beginning once again.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And we just reported last week the Commerce Department came  out with really strong earnings numbers, 16 percent year over year earnings  growth for the economy as a whole in the second quarter.  That too is on a  boom level.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And speaking of tax cuts, one of the reasons the economy's going  great guns, 2.9 percent growth year over year in disposable income  adjusting for inflation.  That's a solid number that deserves to get -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think you were asking earlier, say one bad thing about the  economy.  I'll tell you the one bad thing is borrowed money.  We're running  towards trillion dollar budget deficits and no one is paying attention to  that.  That's not going to help a couple of years down the road.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very good point especially s interest rates move  higher.</p><p>All of that on the agenda this morning.  And joining the conversation this  morning, we've got the President of the St. Louis Federal Reserve here in  studio, James Bullard, president and CEO at the St. Louis Fed is here.   Plus Harvard law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz is going to will  handicap the hearings today.  And former presidential candidate and former  Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee here as well.  All ahead -- don't miss a  moment of it.</p><p>But first, our top story this hour.  And that is the battle for Brett  Kavanaugh's confirmation.  The Supreme Court nominee will face the Senate  Judiciary Committee this morning.  Republicans and Democrats remain largely  divided over securing this nomination.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  I  think you're hearing from a lot of people that can't find anything wrong  with the qualifications of Kavanaugh.  And so many Democrats that said even  before he was nominated they were going to vote against anybody that was on  that list.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  So the bottom line is how much more do you need to know to vote  no?  </p><p>SENATOR DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE MINORITY WHIP:  There's a serious  question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the  Mueller investigation -- something which most Republicans and the  overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake.</p><p>And we asked, of course, Judge Kavanaugh what do you think and he says it's  hands off when it comes to a president during his term in office.  I think  that's a mistake.  And it's one of the major reasons people have misgivings  about his nomination.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that and a lot of other  things, California Congressman, member of the House Judiciary Committee,  Darrell Issa.  Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  </p><p>DARRELL ISSA (R-CA), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Thank you -- Maria.   Thanks for teeing it up that way.  It is always amazing.  Dick Durbin and  so many of those who are the \"I'm going to vote no\" no what matter, are now  grousing overnight that they got 42,000 additional documents that they had  absolutely no right to get out of the Bush One Library.  And they're  complaining they don't have enough time to read them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean it's interesting about all of the outrage over the  documents.  Meanwhile, I know that I've been covering and watching this  document holdout by the FBI and the Department of Justice now for a year  and-a-half, where Congress has been asking for documents.  And it's no  problem, they're just not giving the documents.  And yet this holdback on  documents has created outrage.</p><p>What is your take in terms of what documents should be given over Brett  Kavanaugh, what should be seen, what should be widely distributed and what  shouldn't?  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, I think the one thing that has really stood out is that the  Bush -- H. Bush Library was willing to give any documents.  President Bush,  the father is still alive and those documents are historically not shared.</p><p>You know, many years ago, Justice Roberts actually told me that, you know,  he was uncomfortable with the fact that Reagan's documents came out which  would be fine, Reagan had passed away, but how about the chief justice who  hadn't?  So the idea that these documents between a lawyer and his client  become available is pretty unprecedented and it gives the -- if they want  it, it gives them more information than they would ordinarily get.</p><p>There's not one senator that would say oh, yes, give everything I've ever  said to my attorney, just give that out and forget about attorney/client  privilege much less the normal presidential privilege.</p><p>Here's the thing that's important is if you can't find anything wrong in  over a million documents that were given without selection -- in other  words, they didn't hold back certain ones, why is it you think that if you  just get a few more you're going to get something.</p><p>This man's been an open book.  The problem for the Democrats is they don't  like the book.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a really important point that you make.  Do you  think that there are the votes to nominate Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court, sir?  </p><p>ISSA:  Yes, I think he'll get exactly as Lindsey Graham said 55 or more.   In the ordinary course of a different environment, most of these Democrats  would vote for him.  They have no reason not to.  Politically they're just  choosing to vote no, no matter what.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me switch gears, Congressman -- and ask about you what's  going on between the President and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Once  again, the President is out publicly calling him out, this time accusing  Sessions of hurting the GOP's chances in the midterms.</p><p>So here are these tweets that the President put out this weekend.  Two long  running Obama era investigations of two very popular Republican congressmen  were brought to a well-publicized charge, just ahead of the midterms by the  Jeff Sessions Justice Department.  Two easy wins now in doubt because there  is not enough time.  Good job, Jeff,\" the President writes.</p><p>Then he writes \"The Democrats, none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions, must  love him now.  Same thing with lying James Comey -- the Dems all hated him,  wanted him out, thought he was disgusting until I fired him.  Immediately  he became a wonderful man, a saint-like figure, in fact.  Really sick.\"</p><p>Your reaction to what the President is saying about Jeff Sessions, first  off.  It's odd to see a President calling out his attorney general  repeatedly.  But then again it's odd to see your attorney general not doing  the things that you would expect.  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, I think those are the two balancing acts.  The President wants  to motivate Attorney General Jeff Sessions to be, if you will, the Senator  Sessions that he had hired -- somebody who would be aggressive in getting  documents out that should be released and clearly in the case of the two  congressmen that were indicted three years after their assistant U.S.  attorneys knew about the offenses and fully vetted them is a good example  where the Justice Department is not following its own guidelines, its own  rules on not interfering with elections and putting these out exactly when  neither candidate could get off the ballot, but very likely one or both of  them could be defeated because of these indictments for which there will be  no trial until after the elections.</p><p>So it is an example of, Jeff -- get with the program.  The program is  enforce the laws and regulations, hold these people accountable.  In other  words, run the department.</p><p>And so I think any president looks at his cabinet and says are you running  your department according to the normal rules.  This isn't a political  statement.  This is purely a -- they've got Justice Department guidelines  and they seem to be ignoring them in one direction, which is against  Republicans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, why is he doing that -- Congressman?  I mean what do you  think is going on?  Is there something that he's against the President on?   Why is he not moving forward on things that seem quite obvious in terms of  action from the A.G.?  </p><p>ISSA:  Well, look, Jeff and I worked together for a long time when he was a  senator.  And the one thing that I didn't expect is a deer in the  headlights kind of action where there is so much inaction.</p><p>But candidly, it's not that Jeff Sessions is doing something wrong, it's  that he isn't doing something.  And that's the part where Republicans are  getting frustrated because they want an attorney general that if he has not  recused will be engaged.  And if he is recused, limit only his deputy to  that area that he recused himself.</p><p>Jeff Sessions is still the attorney general and should be doing 99 percent  of overseeing the department.  And yet it seems like very often he does  nothing.  And that's -- I think that's frustrating the President. </p><p>But you know, when there's about 24 people in the greater cabinet, you want  every one of them doing their job.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>ISSA:  When you see one that is under-performing, it worries you.  And the  President, of course, worries over Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to ask you about Twitter and about these testimonies  that are going to happen this week.  But before I move on to that, real  quick, if the President were to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions, how  hard would it be for him to get a new A.G. in there?  Would the Democrats  slow walk the process and not appoint somebody?  </p><p>ISSA:  It will take 30 hours to replace him.  That's the known is 30 hours  of somebody that 51 or 50 plus the Vice President will vote for and that  will be what they'll have to do.</p><p>The question is, who.  They have to choose somebody who has already been  well vetted, somebody the President has confidence in, somebody that really  knows how to take over that department from day one.  That is the  challenge.  And I think until they find that person, the Attorney General  will stay where he is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's talk tech for a moment.  As I first reported  here Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg will face  questions over allowing foreign entities to use their platforms to  influence elections.  This happens tomorrow.  Both will testify.  Jack  Dorsey is also going to testify in front of the Commerce and Energy  Committee.  What should we expect to come out of this?  </p><p>ISSA:  I think you should expect questions on that subject but also I think  on this whole sort of shadow blocking the bias that these media seem to  have.  I think the important thing -- Energy and Commerce, I'm a member on  leave of absence from that committee -- Energy and Commerce oversees a lot  of things.  One of them is, are these entities operating because they have  certain liability exemptions?  Are they operating properly under those?</p><p>And that becomes a real question.  If they're not doing their job the way  you would expect a common carrier to do it, they in fact could expose  themselves to considerable liability.  If they in fact aren't doing their  job relative to elections, they could really distort our ability to get, if  you will, a democracy that we can believe in -- so both are going to be  important subjects.  I think you're going to see some varying onto other  subjects because a lot of people are frustrated with these mediums, if you  will, being hard left.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the worst thing that could happen to these companies?  </p><p>ISSA:  The worst thing that could happen to them is that they don't get the  kind of exemptions they have and that they could be sued by people who feel  they've been done wrong in any number of ways.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a very important point.

Dong Feng Motor, Geely Automobile, and Guangzhou Automobile have lost about  $25 billion in their market cap in Hong Kong just this year.  </p><p>In fact in July, new car sales in China were 5.5 percent lower than in the  same month last year -- pretty substantial drop there.</p><p>Well, Amazon reportedly looking to raise its profile in the $88 billion  online advertising market.  \"The New York Times\" says the company is  gearing up to take on industry leaders Google and Facebook with targeted  ads that consumers are likely to see as suggestions instead of intrusions.

Back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Luxury for less -- Gerri Willis is breaking down how to buy a Rolex watch  on a budget.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  We didn't want to pay $8,000 for  the submarine (ph), all right.  No way.  So we took a look at how do we buy  it on the cheap -- take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS:  Ah, the statement watch.  Cardi B isn't the only one dripping in  finesse and timeless luxury.  You see them everywhere, mostly on the arms  of celebrities.  But with price tags of $3,000 to millions of dollars, how  can you buy one without breaking the bank?  </p><p>PAUL ALTIERI, BOB'S WATCHES:  What we encourage people to do is to go  online, go to Google, you know, shop around.  And you can buy and save 15  to 25 percent by buying pre-owned versus -- </p><p>WILLIS:  What do you mean -- so a used Rolex?  </p><p>ALLEN:  Yes, a used or what we call pre-owned Rolex.  So you go online --  there's a lot of reputable dealers.  We always encourage people to buy from  a reputable dealer.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Paul Altieri owns the online retail store Bob's Watches, one of  the world's biggest online secondhand watch vendors with $32 million in  sales last year.  It's primary offering, the Rolex -- the most recognizable  among luxury watch brands and popular.  When actor Paul Newman's sporty  Rolex watch went up for auction at Phillips in New York -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It is history now.  </p><p>WILLIS:  -- it sold for a record $17.8 million.</p><p>The iconic Rolex takes a full year to make, according to the Swiss maker,  and the enclosure clasp on each watch is closed a thousand times before the  watch is sold.  Some experts say that no Rolex design is approved unless  it's visible from 20 feet away.  The trick for the buyer -- getting the  real thing.  </p><p>ALTIERI:  We always say buy from a reputable dealer, number 1.  Number 2 is  when you're looking at the watch, if the deal seems too good to be true  it's probably not a real watch.  So if you see a watch and it's $50 or  $100, it's probably not a genuine Rolex.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Check out these Rolexes -- beautiful, right.  They're going to be  auctioned off starting September 5th on Bob's Watches.  And If you want to  know if a Rolex is real or not, check out the serial number.  First of all  there should be one on the case and secondly, it has to be quality etched.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.</p><p>WILLIS:  So this is a lot of fun.  I have to tell you, another sign that  you've got a real Rolex as opposed to a fake -- that secondhand sweeps  instead of ticking along.  So you've got to watch for all the particulars.   But you've got to buy from, you know, somebody you can trust at the end of  the day -- a real dealer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  Gerri -- thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're most welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Gerri Willis.</p><p>Coming up -- backlash over Nike's new deal, the boycott after the company  selects Colin Kaepernick for its \"Just Do It\" ad campaign.

That has investors' attention this morning.</p><p>Futures are indicating a mixed market at the start of trading this morning.   As you can see, things have worsened quite a bit.  Dow Industrials down now  80 points.  We're expecting a decline right out of the gate of about a  third of a percent on the Dow.  The S&amp;P 500 is down a fraction.  And the  Nasdaq with a 16-point decline, down a quarter of a percent.</p><p>This after a mixed performance on Friday for the major indices.  As you can  see, the Dow is down 20 but the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq were up on the session  on Friday.  </p><p>In Europe this morning declines across the board, take a look, FT-100 down  almost one half a percent.  CAC Quarante in Paris down 1-1/3 percent.  And  the DAX Index in Germany down better than one percent.   Right here, these are the lows of the morning in Europe as well as on Wall  Street.  </p><p>Asian markets finished mostly in positive territory overnight.  Just the  Nikkei Average in Japan was lower.  Best performer was China.  Shanghai  Composite up, better than one percent.  </p><p>Outrage this morning over former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick being  named the new face of Nike's ad campaign, Just Do It.

A performance  calendar amid a streak of stock market highs.  The S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ,  ripping its new records last week.  While the Dow remains in striking  distance of its own all-time high.</p><p>Joining us right now to look at the backdrop for investing the economy,  James Bullard is the President and the CEO of the St. Louis Federal  Reserve.  Good to see you sir.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>JAMES BULLARD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST. LOUIS:   Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Characterize the backdrop for us in terms of economic success  that we've seen.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Well, from a Central Bank's perspective it doesn't get any better  than this.  You've got relatively rapid economic growth considering the  slow growth over the expansion, we're about three percent year over year  growth rate, low unemployment, good, strong labor markets, inflation just  now right at target on the Fed's preferred measure.  So, I think we're in a  very good -- very good shape right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, when you look at two straight quarters of four  percent growth, which is pretty incredible.</p><p>BULLARD:  Got to love it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that -- is that sustainable?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Well, most forecasts have this slowing down.  I think the  potential growth rate for the U.S. economy is slower, down around two  percent or even less, so we're definitely growing above trend right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you what could get in the way.  Because the Federal  Reserve, Bank of St. Louis recently published a study on how the trade  dispute could sabotage this growth story here in the economy.  Tell us  about that.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, on trade I would -- I would say it's important to get to  some deals somewhere to reduce the uncertainty in this topic because you  don't want to have perpetual uncertainty and perpetual chaos around  possible trade relationships.  </p><p>So I thought this announcement of the Mexico deal was very important.  You  can seal that deal and get it done, that will show that sometimes this does  come to a resolution at some point and that will reduce the uncertainty and  give investors more confidence, I think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's interesting.  Because while these whole trade  uncertainty has been going on, the markets I feel like have given this  administration the benefit of the doubt and not -- because the markets  would be much lower if people really thought that we were in this massive  trade war.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we're still waiting on this uncertainties.  I mean, we  could see additional tariffs go on China this Thursday.  How worried are  you about the U.S.-China relationship in that regard?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, on China, I'm not seeing as much progress being made, both  sides, you know, I suppose is shadow boxing at this point.  But I just  don't see much happening there.  And the Chinese might have different  attitude about what they need to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you think the Mexico deal was optimistic but you're still  waiting on Canada of course.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, they've got to -- I don't know how that's going to turn out  this week.  Obviously the deal seems pretty close.  </p><p>Then you've got -- you know, parliamentary approval on things like that.   So, there's further to go.  But to reach an initial deal would be  important.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's -- let's talk jobs, James because one of the issues was  the fact that we've been waiting for wages to move for so long, wages have  moved, 2.9 percent growth year over year.  And yet now there's a lot of  outcry about now things are getting overheated and the Federal Reserve  should not raise interest rates too much.  What's your take on where we are  in terms of wages and the strength of the jobs market?</p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, the employment cost index is up about 2.9 percent year over  year.  That's not a great number compared to past expansions, but  productivity growth has been low and inflation's about at two percent.  </p><p>So if you think productivity growth is about one percent on average and  inflation's at two, that adds up to three, that should be where wages are.   We're pretty close to that.  </p><p>So, I've say, something more like steady state wages and wage growth  instead of above average wage growth right now, anyway.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how do you ensure that the Fed does sort of balance out  strength that we're seeing but not overdo it.  Because I know we're in an  unprecedented period right now with the Federal Reserve has to unwind the  $4.5 trillion balance sheet at the same time of raising interest rates  coming out from zero, coming up.  So how do you balance that?  Tell us  what's most important.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Maria, this I should say about the Fed, we've already been  preemptive.  We raised rates while the inflation rate was below our target.   We started shrinking the size of the balance sheets before inflation came  up to target.  So we've done these things over the last two years.  Now  we're in pretty good shape and I think what we could do is take signals  from financial markets that are telling us that we're about where we need  to be right now.  </p><p>Yield curve, for instance, is very flat.  I'd rather not see an inverted  yield curve in the U.S.  That's usually a harbinger of a slowdown ahead.   And inflation expectations based on market based measures are low and  remain right around our target.  I think -- I think it shows that we've got  a pretty good policy right now and we should stay where we are and see how  the data come in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you worry that the Fed could overheat, could overdo it  in terms of too many rate hikes?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, I've been concerned about this because -- you know, our  models say one thing but our models are flawed and then financial markets  are saying something else, especially through the yield curve.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us where you see the growth in the economy today.  I  mean, you've got a very good unemployment number at 3.9 percent.  You've  got a very good GDP number.  And we know the job creation has happened  steadily.  Are there areas of the economy that you see growing faster than  others?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Well, the tech sector continues to power the U.S. economy and I  think a great question for investors and I don't have an answer this  morning but, you know, how far can we go in valuing these companies?  Are  they really going to dominate the entire economy or is there going to be  some limit to what they can do?  And I think everyone is kind of scratching  their head about that.  It -- these are really a long winning streak for  these companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, you're right.  Because technology has changed  virtually every industry from health care to automotive.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Every CEO I talk to is worried about getting disrupted especially  by Amazon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And what would that mean for the growth story of the economy,  the disruption part of it?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Well, you could take an optimistic view and say well, that's  keeping people on their toes and they're thinking more about how to use  information technology to improve their businesses.  That's one way to look  at it.  </p><p>Another way to look at it is maybe they're running scared and they're  trying to get shorter term profits while it can.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you know, Alan Greenspan I know, used to look at the stock  market as a really important indicator in terms of the wealth effect.  Do  you -- do you look at the markets because you mentioned the valuations of  the tech companies.  Is this something that you take into account when  looking at monetary policy?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, I think, you know, conventional wisdom is that if the market  goes up by $100, consumption -- and on a sustained basis, you'll get about  $5.00 in consumption spending.  So, it does have an effect on consumption.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, there is a narrative that while things are going really  well right now, over the next year or two things will slow down quite a  bit.  Do you buy into that?  I mean, you know, we spoke with your colleague  Robert Kaplan from Dallas who also said look, we're talking about a three  percent growth number for 2018.  But when you look out to 2020, you're  talking about all the way down to 1.9 percent.  How do you get there?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes, I think the projections are that the economy's going to slow  but -- and I think that's the right thing to base policy on, that that  should be how you plan and then you hope for the best.  You hope that  productivity will improve in the U.S. economy and you'll actually get  faster growth.  That would be great news.  If productivity would improve,  but we need to see it before we can bake that into policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why all the projections that things will slow?  I mean, I'm  just trying to understand what it is that would be causing the slowdown.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Because the potential growth rate is thought to be only about,  you know, two percent in the U.S. economy, maybe one percent productivity  growth and one percent labor force growth.  </p><p>And the demographics we'll probably not going to be able to fix anytime  soon.  So, if we're going to get sustained faster growth, it's got to come  through productivity. </p><p>There's a good angle on that story, because, yes, you could -- you could  see productivity improvement given all the fantastic technology that's  around but that technology has to diffuse into actual production processes  and make things -- you know, make things more productive and I'm not sure  that's always happening.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, when you look out let's call it three years, I mean, the  Federal Reserve has been really the one who has provided the stimulus for  this economy over the last 10 years.  And after the financial crisis, it  was all on you and your colleagues.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, we know that.  And you did a terrific job.</p><p>BULLARD:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But going out, when you look at where the Fed funds rate should  be.  Let's call it three or four years, what's an appropriate number?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Well, like I said, I think we're about where we need to be today.   We've already been preemptive.  We've got inflation right at target.  It  doesn't look like there's a lot of inflation pressure in the U.S. economy  based on tips based type inflation expectations.  So I think we're in good  shape for today and we should just play it going forward by taking in  incoming data and reacting to incoming data and I don't think we have this  -- should have this idea that we have another 150 basis points to go before  we even get to normal.  I think that would be overkill.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of conversation about what the president has said about  Jay Powell, the president last week said he does not regret appointing Jay  Powell as the chairman of the Federal Reserve.  </p><p>But he's been consistently critical of the chairman's gradual rate hikes.   Your take on the Fed's action?  Is this a conversation that's happening at  the Fed that the president talking about the Fed or sort of questioning the  independence.  Does it question the independence?  </p><p>BULLARD:  I don't really think so.  I think the independence is baked into  the law.  </p><p>So, and the law says that the committee is supposed to try to get the best  employment results we can get and get the best inflation results we can get  simultaneously.  So we have to continue to make decisions that we think  will deliver on those mandates.  </p><p>We've talked before, but monetary policy in the U.S. is a global 24 hour a  day debate that's going on.  All kinds of people are weighing in including  politicians, senators, congress -- members of congress can all weigh in  during hearings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p>BULLARD:  So if the president weighs in some ways it's just one more voice.  </p><p>Now, he does have influence over the Fed because he has the appointment  still process.  We just got a new vice chair, Rich Clarida.  I think he'll  be a great addition to the team.  </p><p>So, I think, to the extent he's going to have influence on the  conversation, it's going to be through those appointments more than through  the tweets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  Compare the business climate, business spending with  the consumer right now.  Give us your state of health for both of those  areas.  Because for a long time we were waiting for businesses to start  unleashing money in terms of IIT, and R&amp;D and investing in their  businesses.  But they were sitting on cash for so long because of the  regulatory environment.  That's been unleashed.  Seems like businesses have  started to spend again.  And then we were worried about the consumer but  the last consumer and retail numbers looked pretty good.  Your take on  both.  </p><p>BULLARD:  You know, when I talk to businesses, they're all saying really  great things about -- at least about current results.  They feel very good,  especially about the second quarter.  I'm sure you're hearing all the same  things.  A lot of bullishness out there in these -- in these businesses.  </p><p>I think the trick is to say how are they going to invest in information  technology and use information technology, let's say, over the next five  years to make their businesses better and -- or are they going to get  disrupted by somebody coming from the outside who maybe doesn't know that  much about the business but knows more about how to use information  technology and sort of -- sort of upsets the apple cart for them.  That's  the kind of concern i'm hearing a lot.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about the consumer?  How's the consumer doing?  </p><p>BULLARD:  Consumer seems to be very happy, things seem to be going well.   One of the best contributors to GDP growth, I'm happy right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any worries or you know, uncertainties in terms of where the  consumer spending part of this goes, two-thirds of the economy, obviously  we want to know.  </p><p>BULLARD:  I'm not concerned right now.  I think -- I think we're in good  shape right now.  Obviously, things can happen.  And so, if they do, we'll  have to react at that point.  But for right now things look good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And looks like we're going to see another rate hike in  September, then.  </p><p>BULLARD:  Well, markets are putting a very high probability on it.  And if  you talk to my colleagues, most of them seem to put a high probability as  well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, James Bullard of the St. Louis Federal Reserve,  thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>BULLARD:  All right.  Thanks very much.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you. </p><p>BULLARD:  Thanks for having me this morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you, James Bullard.</p><p>Coming up, a massive maiden voyage, we are checking out Carnival's largest  cruise ship ever.

Cheryl Casone with the details now A strike by  ferry cruise in Greece causing travel problems for thousands, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Now, unhappy holiday there  Maria.  Thousands of tourists were stranded after a one day strike  paralyzed the Ferry.  That round between some of the most popular Greek  island.  Ferry cruise returning to work after the main Greek seamen union  accepted a two percent pay hike following an eight year pay freeze.   Seeming from Greece's ongoing death crisis.  The union was initially  seeking a five percent raise.  Travel though we should say now expected to  be hopefully back to normal at the end of the summer holiday in Greece.  </p><p>Well, a heart breaking loss in Brazil.  A fire turn to the country's  national museum on Sunday.  It destroyed 90 percent of the collection there  including the America's oldest human fossil.  The government is now seeking  funding from banks and companies to rebuild the museum.  Many appointed out  that the treasures house there can frankly just never be restored.   Investigators trying to determine the cause of that massive blaze.</p><p>Well, Carnival has christened its largest cruise ship ever.  The AIDAnova  in Germany, that is the ship now.  The ship can hold up to 6600 people.   It's 1100 feet long, it's got 20 decks, 11 of those for passengers, the  rooms.  Amenities includes 17 restaurants, 23 bars, a casino, a water park,  a scaling wall, even a miniature golf course.  The ship cost nearly $810  million to build.  It's going to set sail in December for the Canary  Islands.  Taking a look at shares of Carnival, they're trading lower in the  premarket.  Maria, this thing we should just say, this ship weighs 184,000  tons.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That looks like something.  That's incredible.  </p><p>CASONE:  Agree.  Yes, I mean, and it's going to be crowded.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Golf course, water park.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  It's like a floating  block of New York City, right?  I mean, look at it, it's like a block,  actually.  184 tons.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All those people.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That sounds like, my gosh,  how does it fly?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's what I mean.

Stay with us.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now this, Nike is facing new backlash this  morning after choosing Colin Kaepernick for its face of the Just Do It  campaign.  Jared Max with the details, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, as we enter our second  straight NFL season with Colin Kaepernick unable to protest the national  anthem on an NFL field.  The one time pro athlete remains under contract  with Nike.  In fact, he's the new poster boy.  </p><p>This advertisement revealed Monday, it's part of Nike's 30th anniversary  celebration of the Just Do It campaign.  It reads, believe in something,  even if it means sacrificing everything.  Nike says the ad is targeted to  teen agers 15-17.  </p><p>Nike has had Kaepernick on payroll since 2011.  His deal was about to  expire.  But Nike reportedly gave him a new multiyear contract with  reported interest from other companies like Adidas and Puma.  </p><p>Nike's vice president of branding in North America told the ESPN we believe  Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation who has  leveraged the power of sport to help move the world forward.  </p><p>The ad reads believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.   Well, how much did Nike sacrifice to align like this with Kaepernick?   Already seeing backlash, several people posting videos on social media  burning Nike shoes, ripping logos off their clothing.  </p><p>Major upsets outside of this story.  In sports last night at the U.S. Open,  not only did Maria Sharapova lose for the first time ever in a night match  at Arthur Ashe Stadium.

This is a business calculation.  Colin Kaepernick  even since he hasn't been playing in the NFL, his jersey has been a top  selling jersey for Nike.

Nearly a dozen employees have left Nike  amid complaints about inappropriate workplace behavior.  Two former Nike  employees have filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, specific  accounts of alleged harassment.

Good Tuesday  morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Tuesday, September 4th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  The markets are waiting for the latest on trade talks with Canada  and more tariffs on Chinese goods, could be going into effect this week.</p><p>Markets down as a result of that futures indicating a decline of about 80  points on Dow out of the gate this morning, a third of a percent lower.   NASDAQ is also down a third of a percent, this after a mixed performance on  Friday for major indices.  On Friday, the Dow Industrials were down but the  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ were up fractionally.  In Europe this morning, markets  down across the board, take a look.</p><p>Money coming out of equities, FT-100 down a half percent.  The CAC quarante  in Paris down 1-2/3 percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany down 1-1/3  percent.  Asian markets finishing mostly in positive territory overnight  with the exception of Japan, it was down a fraction.</p><p>Meanwhile, Supreme Court showdown this morning, nominee Brett Kavanaugh  will head to Capitol Hill this morning for Senate confirmation hearings.   We will bring the hearings live at 9:30 a.m. Eastern.  They will be  happening all week.  It begins today.</p><p>Nike tripping off.  The company under fire for making embattled former  quarterback Colin Kaepernick, its new face of its new ad campaign, just do  it.  The outrage coming up.  Take a look at this frothy beverage, no, it is  not beer, its ramen soup.  The details on this daring drink later in the  show this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, and joining me, our own  Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon  Hilsenrath, and the King's College Business and Economics Professor, Brian  Brenberg.  Welcome back from the summer.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  We get to try out the  ramen?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The ramen?  You want to try out the ramen?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if we have on set today actually but --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  If we had on set, there would  be -- we would have given you a bib already.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Brian said, it looks like a typical college breakfast beer,  right?  Beer and ramen noodle.  </p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE KING'S COLLEGE:  This is  going to replace all nutrition in any of my student's diet.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  A lot this morning to talk about after vacation  summer.  We got several things on the horizon.  Federal Reserve meeting  September 26, third-quarter earnings coming out in the next two weeks, the  midterm elections,</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jobs' report is out on Friday.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Jobs' report Friday after Labor Day Monday.  It's going to be  a good another good jobs' report.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We could possibly see the unemployment rate fall to 3.8 percent  which is -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, before the end of the year we could be down 3- 1/2 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is incredible.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's what a lot of people are projecting.  </p><p>BRENBERG:  Or even more incredible considering all of this is happening in  midst of the supposed uncertainty around trade.  It seems like businesses  aren't paying attention or at least at a widespread basis to those threats  from trade because we see the hiring, we see the growth.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're paying attention because a lot of the -- particularly  the retail CEOs on the earnings calls for the last quarter were talking  about the diversity of their supply chains and, I guess we should be lucky  that this is happening now because the supply chains are more diverse than  they were --  </p><p>BRENBERG:  They've been able to adapt.  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Except for Apple.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  How much better would thing be right now in the market, in the  economy if we didn't have this trade uncertainty?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, You know what, it kind of --  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It would really unleash the markets.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we kind of saw that when the Mexico deal was announced, that  huge run-up in stocks.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It hit the highs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It raises the issue if the White House and the government could  just get out of the way.  And, you know, solve some of these trade problems  rather than creating more of them, then we -- it could be off the races. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it sounds like you solved something for Mexico but now  we're waiting on Canada.  Will Canada join to create a new NAFTA?  That's  the question.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And that isn't really -- there is still so many uncertainties  hanging over.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  China.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  A lot of details even in the Mexico deal haven't come out and  then we have to see if Canada comes on, will Congress do anything if Canada  doesn't come on?  Will the President just scrap it all if the Congress  doesn't come along?  There's a lot of uncertainties, even on North America. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is what's pressuring markets this morning down about 80  points on the Dow, that as one of the stories that we're following.  But  our top story this hour, Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh,  testifying this morning, later this morning as the battle over his  confirmation is set to begin.  Blake Burman is covering the story, he's at  the White House right now.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as  well.  And according to excerpt server just passed on to us by the White  House, Brett Kavanaugh will testify last this morning before the Senate  Judiciary Committee that if he's put on to the Supreme Court, he will act,  he see is it will just be one of nine justices, one of a team of nine as  people testify later this morning.</p><p>Kavanaugh adding of his judicial philosophy the following, saying \"a good  judge must be an umpire, a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no  litigant or policy.\"  Kavanaugh will also go on to testify.  I don't decide  cases based on personal or policy preferences.  I'm not a pro-plaintiff or  pro-defendant judge, I'm not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge.  I am  a pro-law judge.  </p><p>Now, in a lead-up for the confirmation hearings, Democrats tried to delay  the proceedings, saying they need more of Kavanaugh's documents.  The top  Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer says another 42,000 pages worth were  produced just last night.  Democrats also decried the White House declaring  executive privilege on another 100,000 pages from Kavanaugh's time in the  Bush White House.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  They are suppressing these documents.  If  we're lucky, we will see six percent -- six percent of all of the documents  that have been produced -- could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true  position on issues.  He is saying -- and the White House saying, the  American people have no right to know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Republicans say though Kavanaugh has produced more documents than  recent nominees and contend his credentials are impeccable.  Yale Law  School, a clerk for Justice Kennedy who he is seeking to replace in more  than a decade on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Democrats Jim  Donnelly, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin who voted for Neil Gorsuch last  year along with Doug Jones in Alabama are the Democratic votes to watch.</p><p>Lindsey Graham predicting over the weekend that Kavanaugh could receive 55  votes.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Yes.  I think there are a handful  of Democrats who will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well.  And maybe  even more.  A lot of people should vote for judge Kavanaugh.  If you're  looking to Republican President to pick a qualified conservative, he would  be on the top of anyone's list, including not just Donald Trump.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Reality though, Maria, if Kavanaugh gets every single Republican  vote, that would be enough, they wouldn't need a single Democrat to come on  their side.  Opening statements later this morning and then the question  and answer Session starts tomorrow.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman with the  latest there.  Stay with us, we've got live coverage of Judge Brett  Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings this morning beginning at  9:30 a.m. Eastern.  We will take you there live to the judiciary hearing.   First now, former Arkansas Governor and Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee  joins us.</p><p>Governor, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Always a pleasure, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your expectation ahead of these Kavanaugh confirmation hearings  this morning.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, he is going to get confirmed, it's going to be a circus in  a show, but it will eventually happen.  I just find it amusing, if not  embarrassing what Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin are saying about the number of  documents, they don't have time to read them.  Heck, they didn't even read  the Obamacare law before they voted on it.  And for them to pretend that  they're going to read these documents, I'd love to put them under oath.</p><p>And ask them, how many pages of these documents have you read?  I bet it's  less than five pages.  So it's just nonsense.  He's eminently qualified.   What I appreciate most about him is that he's not an activist.  He  understand that he's appointed to the court, he's not there to legislate.   He is simply there to adjudicate and it's not his job to make up the law,  simply to make sure that whatever law is legislated conforms to the  constitution.</p><p>BRENBERG:  Governor, isn't that -- that's really the issue that you just  hit on here at the end of your statement.  Kavanaugh sees himself as an  umpire and that is exactly what some won like Chuck Schumer doesn't want to  see because they want the Supreme Court to be a place where laws are made  not where the constitution is interpreted, Kavanaugh is a big threat  because he's going to stand in the way of that happening.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, let's hope he does because we've had decades of courts  that decided that that they would do what a legislature didn't have the  guts to do and that's pass a law.  So they tossed it to the courts but what  we've ended up, we've shredded the constitution.  Anybody who passed Ninth  grade Civics ought to know that the three branches of government are equal  but they're distinct and different and they have different functions and  roles.</p><p>And the judiciary does not have the capacity to create law to make  something out of thin air, they've been doing it for decades.  And it's  really hurt this great Republic of ours.  It's time to get back to people  who don't believe in this doctrine of judicial supremacy that is not just  the Supreme Court but it's the supreme branch, it is not.  It is an equal  branch and it cannot act unless it's in concert with the executive and  legislative.</p><p>And, so I'm hoping that maybe this will be a great opportunity to showcase  that constitutional role of the court.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it sounds like you think he is going to be confirmed before  the Supreme Court Session starts October 1?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  I think so, yes.  I think the Republicans are going to vote for  him, and I don't know how in the world some of these Democrats like  Donnelly and Manchin and Heitkamp not vote for him and expect to still be a  Senator.  So it really depends do they want to be a Senator?  And do they  want to have the integrity of their office intact because how do they  justify not voting for him, they can't.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want o move to one of the other big stories of the morning  and that is former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick has signed a multi-year  deal with Nike.  It makes him the face of their famous Just Do It campaign.   Nike is facing backlash over this move with some customers going so far as  to burn their Nike shoes and this is going viral.  Governor, does this move  show Nike is out of touch?  What's your take on Nike's plans here?  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You just wonder, what are they thinking?  Are they so isolated  in their corporate headquarters that they can't see that maybe some people  have said it this I way that Colin Kaepernick is the real Al Bundy.  He  sucks at football and he's now selling shoes.  I mean, this is a guy who  has played no more in the NFL in the past two years than I have.  And I've  not even been on the field.</p><p>So, why are they somehow elevating him to some hero status?  I mean, they  used to have guys like Michael Jordan and top athletes in their field and  now they got a guy who nobody wants to have him on their team.  And he's  primarily known for his protests in wearing socks with policemen depicted  as pigs.  I'm wondering if Nike is going to sell those socks as part of new  deal with him. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Dagen, you had idea in terms of why Nike would do this  earlier. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When its corporate virtue signaling number one, and it is a  business calculation that the Kaepernick jersey even after he stopped  playing in the NFL, he's still been a good if not best-selling jersey for  Nike.  So number two, they know that there is nothing lost in them using  him as the face of this new campaign, and to do a little bit of -- show  that they've got their social justice credibility.</p><p>And Governor, I would argue that because that -- nearly a dozen people have  left Nike because of complaints about inappropriate workplace behavior,  that this is a way for them to draw attention away from that and to the new  spokesman of their campaign.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  And is also a way to wave their middle finger at half the  American voters and half the American public who were leaving the NFL in  droves not only television ratings but in the purchase of merchandise and  tickets and there are a lot of empty seats in NFL games right now because  people are just fed up with, you know, what once was a sports efforts now  becoming a political arena.</p><p>People don't go to the movies and they don't go to these sports arenas  because they want to be preached to and lectured at by people who are  pushing their personal politics.  Take it off the field, say whatever you  want, but I mean I just can't imagine how Nike thinks this is a brilliant  move for them.  Everybody is talking about him, so maybe, you know, if  that's their goal, they've got it but not everybody is talking favorably  about the debate.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just to note though, people, you know, in the -- because I  criticized a left for the manufactured outrage and there is -- there is  some of that on the right as well about this.  So anybody who is bragging  about their Converse tennis shoes, well, Nike owns Converse.  So I will  just point that out because you saw somebody taking a photo of their feet  on Twitter, yesterday like, OK, you still bought those shoes from Nike. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  My favorite is still Stan Smith, Adidas.  Just saying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Adidas.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Let's turn to something close to you, Governor, back in  June, your daughter White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders was refused  service at that Red Hen restaurant in Lexington, Virginia.  Now, a local  publication is reporting that the area's tourism board is spending money to  repair the town's image.  Interesting developments, sir.  Your thoughts.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well, It is tragic that all of these other business owners, you  know, are being hurt by the actions of one bigoted restaurant owner.  The  Red Hen I guess is going to have a new menu, bigots breakfast, leftist  lunch, and discrimination dinner.  But the tragedy is you've got all these  other businesses there in LexingtonVirginia that are suffering because of  the discrimination of one restaurant owner in a small little restaurant.</p><p>And I feel for those people and I hope they can rehab their image because  it's a beautiful impunity, it's a beautiful part of Virginia.  Washington  at least, near there, great university, and frankly they don't deserve to  all suffer because one person decided to take it upon herself to throw  someone out of a restaurant because she represents the political point of  view that is different than hers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just incredible.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's hardly kind of America that is good for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, it's great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You bet, Maria.  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former Governor Mike Huckabee joining us there.  Coming up,  raising for impact.  We got all the details on tropical storm Gordon you  can have be, breaking for impact details on tropical storm Gordon.  He is  gaining strength as it nears the Gulf Coast line.  We've got the latest  weather forecast next.  Then brewing up something new.  We check out this  bowl of ramen inspired by beer, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Bracing for impact.  Tropical storm Gordon is  racing is racing toward Gulf Coast this morning.  Fox News Senior  Meteorologist Janice Dean with the very latest details here.  Janice,  again.  </p><p>JANICE DEAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST:  Ah, Maria yes.  And we're  getting busy not only do we have Gordon, we have Florence also in the  Atlantic behind that several other systems coming off the coast of Africa.   But this is Gordon preparing here for a land falling tropical system.  We  think it will become a minimal hurricane as it approaches the coastline  between 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.</p><p>We hurricane warnings here from Southeastern Louisiana through much of  Mississippi Coastal, Mississippi and Alabama as well tropical storm  warnings for all of Louisiana, the Coast of Louisiana area up towards the  panhandle of Florida.  Here is the latest track as of 8:00 a.m.  We think  it's going to become a hurricane within the next four to six hours.  And  again, the minimum hurricane making landfall tonight overnight.</p><p>And then heavy rainfall in its wake as it makes its way northward.  The  good news with this system is it is going to be a quick mover, so it's over  pretty quickly but we're still going to see on order of three to six inches  of heavy rainfall, three to six feet of storm surge and this rain is going  to continue to move northward.  Also, the potential of strong to severe  storms including isolated tornados with these landfalling her.</p><p>But I think the legacy will be the heavy rainfall and then behind this  watching Florence for the East Coast, Maria, and several other systems.  So  hurricane season not done yet, we actually might see the busiest in the  month of September.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, it is that time of the year I guess.  Janice,  thank you.  We'll be watching.  Janice Dean.  Coming up.  Easing pain at  the pump.  The outlook on gasoline prices as summer winds down, that's  next.  And Tiffany's $250-million bet, check this out why classic jewelry  store taking a chance on brick and mortar in the age of Amazon, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Easing pain at the pump.  AAA is forecasting  gasoline prices to decline this summer as summer winds down but the looming  threat of tropical storm Gordon could send oil prices soaring.  Joining us  now to discuss that is OPIS Global Head of Energy Analysis, Tom Kloza.   Tom, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>TOM KLOZA, HEAD OF ENERGY ANALYSIS, OPIS GLOBAL:  Nice to be here.  Sorry  to see a hurricane.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're sorry too.  We've been talking about Gordon which  is now a tropical storm but we'll see what happens next.  Now we got  Florence as well.  Tom, as the summer is winding down, what are your  expectations for gasoline?  Typically when you go into fall where demand  comes back down after a summer of demand, do prizes move?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Typically, in three of the last four years we've dropped 40 or 50  cents from Labor Day to Christmas Day.  This year that's not going to  happen.  First of all, we're going to see a head fake now with the storm  possibly heading towards Southern Louisiana where there's a lot of  refineries and there's a lot of offshore oil rigs.  And after that we'll  probably see prices bleed a little bit lower but it's really hurricane Iran  that we need to worry about for the next 60 or 90 days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hurricane Iran, OK.  Jon?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Why is that?  Explain what your concerns are about Iran right  now.  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, you know, the administration is really put the handcuffs on  Iran and Iranian crude exports have already dropped by about 800,000  barrels a day or so.  The world oil market is very tight, we're still  seeing a lot of global growth, now, that may be offset if some of these  developing countries have problems with their currency.  But we should lose  some more Iranian oil in the next 100 days or so.</p><p>And this administration seems pretty definite that they want to bring Iran  to their knees before they bring them to the negotiating table.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Tom, we're talking about hurricanes now in the Gulf Coast.   How are American refineries prepared for another big storm?  Are they in  better condition preparation wise than they were say more than a decade ago  when Katrina hit?  What steps have they -- have they taken to insulate  themselves from natural disasters?  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, actually they're not in better shape, if you had a category,  three, four, or five storm.  They don't have let's say some of the  retaining walls or some of the things to prevent that, but they're in very  good shape to withstand tropical storm winds, category one or category two.   Some of them have cogeneration, so that if the electric grid gets knocked  out, they'll be OK.</p><p>I think Gordon probably results in some precautionary shutdowns to tighten  up gasoline for a while.  The nice thing about September storm as opposed  to August is we're on cusp of switching to winter specifications for  gasoline.  You can throw a lot more ingredients into the gasoline mixture.   And my hunch is that if this storm made a beeline for New Orleans that we  would probably see the Federal government many of these agencies just go  ahead and say the summer is over, you can make autumn and winter gasoline.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we've got the SPR to open up in case there's actual supply  disruption of crude.  Tom, really quickly, so the Energy Information  Administration announced last month that the port district of Houston- Galveston has now started exporting more crude oil than it imported for the  very first time.  We have a light -- a lighter crude versus kind of heavier  crude than we -- that we import to refine here.</p><p>Talk about our refineries basically switching over to be able to refine  more of the oil that we're getting out of the ground.  </p><p>KLOZA:  Well, we've had a lot of projects to run very light, tight, very,  very sweet crude.  We actually exported 66 million barrels of U.S. crude in  the month of June.  Now to put that in perspective, we're going to release  maybe 11 million barrels of heavy crude from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve in October and early November.  So I think prices will be modest  between now and say election time.</p><p>After the election and after the November 4th deadline for Iran, you got to  watch out for a winter of discontent.  We could see much higher prices  across the board.  Not just gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, you name it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Tom, great to have your  insights as always.  Thanks so much.</p><p>KLOZA:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Kloza joining us there.  Coming up.  Nike steps into new  controversy this morning.

We've got the details on this strange brew, coming up  this morning.</p><p>First, to our top story this half an hour, Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the hot  seat this morning.  President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee set to  appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, one hour from right now, that  will set off a partisan battle over a lifetime appointment to the high  court.  Joining me right now is Harvard Law Professor Emeritus and author  of \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump,\" Alan Dershowitz.  Alan, good to see  you, thanks so much for being here this morning.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your expectations for these hearings to set to begin in about  an hour.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, they're usually entirely predictable.  They'll ask him  about his judicial philosophy, he'll answer in general terms.  They'll ask  him a few things, Roe vs. Wade is established law, he'll say yes.  They'll  ask him whether he accepts the binding power of precedent, and he'll say,  well, it's less binding on the Supreme Court than on the Court of Appeals,  but he certainly respects precedent.  The big question is will there be any  surprises?  Have the Democrats come up with any fact or information that  we're not aware of that could catch him by surprise.  </p><p>Generally, these nominees are very, very well-prepared.  Kavanaugh is off  the charts brilliant, he has an incredible academic background and record  from Yale, a terrific record as a Court of Appeals judge.  He's eminently  qualified for the job, but the Democrats have a right to ask him hard  questions to see whether he's going to shift the Supreme Court way, way to  the right.  Look, Bork was well-qualified too and he didn't get the  nomination primarily because he had written so much.  Kavanaugh has written  primarily through his opinions, but he also has some law review articles  that are somewhat controversial. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's not forget -- I mean, even before the documents  were out, even before anything was known about Brett Kavanaugh, Chuck  Schumer was very clear, we're going to make it hard as possible for the  President to get another Supreme Court pick in place.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Of course.  Because it's tit-for-tat, the Republicans did the  same thing when Merrick Garland, who is extraordinarily well-qualified,  Kavanaugh's colleague, extremely well-qualified.  The Republicans said we  won't give him a hearing, we won't give him an up-and-down vote.  So,  what's happened is judicial nominations have become Ping-Pong balls and  being, you know, back and forth on the table.  It's a tragedy because it  would be so much better if the most-qualified people were nominated and  confirmed by both sides, but that's a dream that disappeared probably  several decades ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, bottomline, do you think the votes are there to put Judge  Kavanaugh on the court?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Oh, without a doubt, absent some surprise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  The September surprise that we're not aware of.  He'll be  confirmed -- he'll be confirmed probably 53, 54 votes, something in that  range.  But it will be a partisan --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, that includes Democrats in your view?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  It will be a partisan -- yes, there'll be a couple of  Democrats that will come along.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me -- let me switch gears, Alan, I got to ask you about  what the President is talking about with regard to his to attorney general.   Ahead of this big week, the President came out swinging against Jeff  Sessions -- he said this, \"Two long-running Obama-era investigations of two  very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well-publicized  charge just ahead of the midterms by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department.   Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time.  Good job,  Jeff.\"  And then, the President is basically referring to charges of two  Congressmen right before the midterm elections, Alan.  Your reaction.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I don't think the President should be commenting on  people who have been charged.  We have to know what the facts are, one of  them was charged by the Obama administration, the other one, the insider  trading was charges by the Trump administration.  I don't think that the  Justice Department should be partisan, and should have a different standard  for indicting Democrats or Republicans.  There are rules about the midterm  election but they --these indictments came within those rules.  It's  usually a two-month rule.  So, I think it's a misplaced criticism by the  President and could be dangerous if, you know, Democrats and Republicans  alike started to try to politicize who was prosecuted and when they're  prosecuted and what impact it can have on election.  That's a dangerous  trend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is really -- you're right, you're right.  This is  a really important point that you're making.  But, Alan, this is a bigger  issue between the President and his attorney.  You know that.  I mean, Jeff  Session has in place since the President got -- began his term and he  recused himself from Russia, and as a result, in doing so, has been, you  know, unwilling or unable to get involved in any of -- any of these  headlines whereas we know what went on during the 2016 election at the top  of the FBI and the DOJ.  We know that there was really no investigation of  Hillary Clinton, and Jeff Sessions doesn't do anything about it.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I think Jeff Sessions disappointed the President by not  telling him in advance that he might have to recuse himself about the  Russia -- he never would have gotten the job if he had told the President  that.  I think the second point is when he recused himself, he probably  should have offered his letter of resignation.  He did offer a letter of  resignation later but it was at a time when it would be politically  difficult.  Right now, I think it's very, very difficult for the President  to be seen as firing Jeff Sessions in order to influence the Russia  investigation.  Obviously, it would depend on who we replace him with.  </p><p>Remember that when we had the Watergate, Edward Levy, the President of the  University of Chicago, the former dean of the law school was picked to be  attorney general.  If the President would have picked somebody like that,  there'd be no criticism.  But if he picked, quote, a loyalist, who would  try to influence the investigation, that would be perceived as somehow  putting his thumb on the scale of justice, and it would not affect -- it  would not work well for him, I think he understands that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But remember how long it took for so many of the President's  appointments to actually get put in place because the Dems did not want the  President to execute his strategy, and they were slow walking all the  appointments.  Let's say, hypothetically speaking, the President fires Jeff  Sessions after the midterm elections.  How long will it take for him to get  another A.G. in place?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, it depends, if he appoints somebody with superb  objective credentials, no time at all, but if he picks somebody that is  perceived as perhaps wanting to slow down or end the investigation, the  Democrats will do everything in their power to delay and prevent that from  happening, because they want to see Rod Rosenstein --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But won't they do everything in their power to delay regardless  of who it is?  I mean, look, we just --</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  No.  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We just said a minute ago that even before we knew anything  about Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Chuck Schumer said I'm going to make it as  hard as possible for the President to get another Supreme Court pick in  there.  He just told us that.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I think there's a -- I think there's a big difference  between a Supreme Court nominee who is supposed to be objective and  independent, and a cabinet member, the President is entitled to pick his  own person to be a cabinet member.  Remember, John Kennedy picked his  brother; Ronald Reagan picked his private lawyer; Barack Obama picked a  very loyal friend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, how long does it take to get the CIA pick in there?  Gina  --</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Look, it's become so -- everything is so political, everything  is so partisan today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you say if it's a clear, you know, independent person,  fine, but that's actually not true.  There slowwalking everybody.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, let him try.  I would love to see them pick an  objective, independent, brilliant person and of great credibility.  And  then, he wins the fight if they slow that down.  But if he appoints a  partisan then you're going to see partisan politics play a role.  So, the  President plays a role depending on who he picks, and then, Congress  responds to that pick.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the Twitter CEO testimony tomorrow, Jack  Dorsey CEO of Twitter, as I first reported will be testifying before two  panels tomorrow along with Facebook Sheryl Sandberg.  She's testifying  before one committee in the Senate.  The CEO of Twitter will like be asked  about how his site polices users and content.  What are you expecting to  hear and how does this end, Alan?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, nobody knows what the truth is.  We need an objective  independent, expert commission, looking into whether or not the social  media do allow political considerations to impact their algorithms.  I  don't know the answer to that.  We're going to hear no today from the  people who have a stake in that.  We're going to hear yes from people on  the other side and none of us is going to know the answer.  It's a  technical, highly scientific issue.  We ought to get to the bottom of it by  experts who are objective.  We don't have a stake and can tell us whether  there is a thumb on the scale of free speech.  We have the right to know  the answer to that question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most people would like to see competition fix  this problem, right?  Alan, as a -- as oppose to a heavier government hand  and regulating these business.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  I agree.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we don't know how this goes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  I agree but we have to know the facts first thing we have to  know is whether or not this problem exists, or whether or not, it's made  up, and exaggerated I suspect that somewhere in between, and we, the  public, have a right to know whether the social media which have such a  major impact on all of our lives, are fair and objective, I hope they are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the leadership of these two companies coming, but  nobody really, in terms of leadership at Google.  That's interesting.  Do  you think Google is going to be forced to testify as well?  Owner of  YouTube.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Oh, of course.  Of course, of course, everybody is going to  have to come in and testify, and everybody is going to remember what  happened when the cigarette industry leaders put hands up said we swear  that there's no -- you know, nicotine is not an addictive -- we know that  we don't always expect objective testimony from the leaders of company.  I  think we'll get good testimony.  And Sheryl Sandberg was a student at  Harvard, she's a terrific, terrific woman.  I expect she'll tell the truth.   It's not so clear that the whole truth, though, will emerge from  adversarial questioning of adversarial leaders.  I think we need scientific  objective truth so we, the people, can make the final decision.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because the -- they can say the algorithm does it and  that's who decides.  But somebody puts together the --</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Who knows what that means?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- algorithm, right?  Somebody programmed the algorithm?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Of course.  Of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, boy.  Well, this would --</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  There are people who can tell us the truth, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Alan, great to get your insights.  As always, thanks  so much.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Alan Dershowitz joining us.  Stay with us, we've got a big  interview, coming up.  Susan Li will sit down in a \"FIRST ON FOX BUSINESS\"  interview with the CEO of Uber, that's tomorrow -- the company gearing up  to go public.  Don't miss Susan's important interview tomorrow.  First,  though, coming up next, Nike's controversial move, the backlash after the  company names Colin Kaepernick the face of its Just Do It campaign, that's  next.  And then, the big bet from Tiffany, how the jewelry giant is working  to compete against other luxury retailers all in the age of Amazon, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Nike, the biggest loser in the premarket this  morning, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has many consumers are  outraged over the company's deal with Colin Kaepernick.  Nicole Petallides  on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details.  Nic, good  morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning.  Great  to see you, Maria.  Do you know that I just went into one of the trading  booths?  I started an argument, discussing exactly this, Colin Kaepernick  now being the face of the 30-year anniversary of Nike's Just Do It  campaign.  One of the traders said if you're going to talk about believe in  something, even if it means sacrificing everything, why don't you put a  U.S. Marine, while the other trader says, he thinks more athletes will be  at to sign with Nike and get onboard.  So, while this is a very  controversial topic, people are concerned about the type of business it  might bring to Nike while one trader said it might bring more athletes to  sign on, others have said it's bad business for Nike, couldn't they have  chose somebody else?  </p><p>In the meantime, we've seen videos of people burning their Nike sneakers.   #nikeboycott is one of the leading trending hashtags this morning, Maria.   At the same time on social media, dear Nike, I appreciate you standing with  Kaepernick.  So, it certainly seems to be the talk, but look at what's  happening to the stock.  And maybe this is the indication of the true  business of what it might mean for Nike, and that is down three percent  this morning.</p><p>Then, we'll take a look at Tiffany this morning, down a little bit, but the  big news is that Tiffany is going to have a revamp, it will take about  three years.  They're investing $250 million redoing the 78-year-old store  Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast at Tiffany's just trying to bring in the younger  folks, just like Target has done, they spent billions.  Macy's has done the  very same in order to remain competitive.  Big-picture picture are feeling  optimistic, still watching all about trade.  We have a lot of Fed speakers,  we have jobs Friday right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  And some of the  numbers from abroad for manufacturing weakness in Europe, China factory  growth slowed to a 14-month low, and Japan business sentiment 21-month low.   Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nic, thank you so much.  Coming up, have a drink  and eat it too, details on the new ramen beer taking the internet by storm.   We're going to tell you about it, next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  -- is coming out of Egypt this  morning.  Well, back to -- at home, United Airlines raising first checked  bag fees from $25.00 to $30.00  And second bag fees have gone up from  $35.00 to $40.00.  This comes just days after JetBlue, Air Canada, and  WestJet raised all of their baggage fees.  United says higher fees are  going to allow to continue investing in the overall customer experience.   You know, the part where you're on the plane but without your checked  luggage.  OK.</p><p>Ford, is (INAUDIBLE) future for its Mondeo sedan.  The company denying  published reports that it plans to stop making the vehicle, and said that  they're going to actually upgrade it.  London Sunday Times have reported  that production of the Mondeo along with other models was going to be  halted, that's part of this global restructuring that would have eliminated  as many as 24,000 jobs.  But Ford lower in the premarket, down almost a  quarter percent and pushing back, we should say, on that report.</p><p>And then, finally, check this out, a restaurant in British Columbia is  putting a new spin on traditional Japanese dishes like ramen.  They're  serving ramen noodles inside of a beer mug.  Now, topped with a foam that's  made from a combination of egg whites and gelatin.  And there's the thing,  it looks like a pint of beer but there is no beer inside of this.  How  disappointing is that?</p><p>It was supposed to be a summertime drink.  They might extend it because it  is popular without alcohol, even.  Back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it looks good, what is it --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  British, Columbia, I would have been on it for you, you know that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  And British Columbia.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've heard of a mug of cup noodles, that's \"muganoodles\"  (INAUDIBLE) noodles, I guess.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  We need some on set.  I mean, we wanted to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cheryl is on it.  Thanks, Cheryl.  All right.  Quick break, and  then we'll get final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Earlier, we're having a conversation about plastic on  furniture, Dagen, said.  Everybody knows you have plastic on the furniture.   That was photo of me as a five-year-old in my parents' living room with  plastic on the chairs.  I got my hair flip right though.  I knew -- I knew  I wanted to be on camera.  Even then, at five years old.  I love it.  That  was so funny when you said that, because I thought, you're right.  I  remember.</p><p>BRENBERG:  We've all seen it, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great, great stuff.  All right, final thoughts, you guys, great  show, back from summer.  Your thoughts</p><p>BRENBERG:  That back from summer, right, and I think there's going to be a  lot of heat going on this week with the Kavanaugh hearings.  At the end of  the day, I think he gets through, and I think the Friday jobs' number  really puts an exclamation point on what's happening --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure does.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  While we're talking about Kavanaugh and jobs, we got to talk  about trade, you know, where we're going to get another 200 billion of  tariffs on China, and as Canada comes to the table and get things done with  the President, so it's a big week in trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Most important issues, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And a caution to the Democrats, don't talk down this economy.   It's good, and you didn't vote for the tax cuts that helped lift  everybody's vote in this country, so find something else to complain about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wonder if people are going to remember that, come the midterm  elections, that not one Dem voted for the tax cut.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  Have a great day, everybody.  Go seize that day.   Dagen McDowell, Jon Hilsenrath, Brian Brenberg, thank you so much.  That  will do it us.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" now.  Here's Charles Payne in for Stuart  this morning.  Charles, take it away.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Thank you very much, Maria. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We're going to say good morning to Maria Bartiromo. Good to see you. Welcome back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey there ladies, thanks so much. Great to be back. Good morning everybody, welcome back from the summertime. I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Tuesday. It is Tuesday September 4th. Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors have a lot to keep their eyes on this week between waiting for a trade deal with Canada and expected tariffs on more Chinese goods. Plus, news on the political front.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures this morning showing the markets will open mix. Dow Industrials down about 20 points right now. Fractional moves on the upside though for the S&amp;P500, up almost one point and the NASDAQ up eight and a half right now.</p><p>This after a mixed close on Friday for the major indices, take a look at Friday's performance, August, still finishing in the green though despite Friday's decline of about 22 points on the Dow. S&amp;P and the NASDAQ were up as you can see. The Dow adding just over two percent for the month of August, the S&amp;P500 was up three percent for the month of August, and the NASDAQ is the big winner with an additional 5.7 percent move for the month of August alone.</p><p>Check out markets in Europe this morning, take a look, we are looking at a down session with the FT-100 down 11 points, CAC Quarante down about 55, better than one percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down almost one percent despite reports that President Trump is ready to drop another round of tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods as early as this week.</p><p>Asian markets finished mostly in positive territory overnight with the exception of Japan. Nikkei Average down just marginally.</p><p>Here comes the judge, Brett Kavanaugh is set to be begin Senate confirmation hearings today, this as the Trump Administration announced that it will withhold more than 100,000 pages of documents on Kavanaugh. They say that the documents are protected by constitutional privilege.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: His records speaks for itself. So those who raise questions now about 100,000 documents, et cetera, that they'd like to see when he works for the White House years ago, you know, that's just an attempt to slowdown the proceedings to embarrass him. But his record is going to carry him through.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The administration did release more than 42,000 pages on Kavanaugh just yesterday.</p><p>Extreme weather to report, Tropical Storm Gordon is now barrowing toward the Gulf Coast. The very latest on Gordon's move.</p><p>Then outrage after Colin Kaepernick was named the new face of Nike, the backlash coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, our own Dagen McDowell. The Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath. And Kings College Business and Economics Professor Brian Brenberg. Great to see you.</p><p>BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, KING'S COLLEGE: Good morning. Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back from the summer.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: It's great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to be back. I missed you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I missed you so much. But you're the hardest worker and woman in the news business, so you deserve some time off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I am dying to hear what you think about everything that's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So much going on. Jon, it's good to see you again.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It is good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot on the economic front as well.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Lot to talk about on trade. We have a great story on paper today on the dairy market. I was going to send this to you over the weekend Dagen. A good points and hypocrisy on both sides about dairy trade, is it the center of U.S.-Canada trade arguments right now? And both sides are rigging our dairy markets, so we should -- and our viewers should take a look at that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And look what I've printed out this morning, \"Why Milk Matters?\" The U.S. and Canada trade fight.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I knew Dagen was going to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is apparently a -- again, this is why it's not that big of a stumbling block I don't think in the -- in the negotiations with Canada to be part of the NAFTA rewrite because we actually benefit from the current policy in Canada.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We're running a trade surplus.</p><p>MCDOWELL: $650 million trade surplus on dairy.</p><p>HILSENRATH: We're actually dumping surplus milk into Canada and we want to be able to dump more.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll see. I mean, the -- a deal with Mexico is, what, a handshake? I mean, it's done.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will Canada follow up soon?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, that's the big question. And then there was an interesting episode last week where the president had an interview with Bloomberg News and somehow it leaked out. He -- where he made some comments off the record saying he's not going to give Canada any ground whatsoever and they either have to take it or leave, so let's see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One thing that Jon pointed out last week though that in order to get fast-track status on this trade and that is pass it with just a simple majority instead of 60 votes in the Senate, Canada according to, like, Senator Toomey for example, he says among others that Canada has to be part of it to get fast-track approval.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And the president was tweeting about this week --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Congress has to sign off on this.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- he was tweeting to Congress, \"Stay out of this, take whatever deal I give you.\" Or else -- he's saying he's going to pull out of all these trade deals.</p><p>BRENBERG: But the fact is it makes zero sense from Canada's perspective to not get something done. If they didn't get something done, they would be the big losers in this. That's why ultimately I think they'll come the president's way and get something done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very important point. I think I agree with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's why dairy matters so much because if they get the wrong side of the dairy deal, it's a very politically powerful industry and particularly in Quebec and we'll have to see how much they dig their heels in on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a lot on that coming up, that's one of the key stories of course. Joining the conversation this morning, St. Louis Federal Reserve President and CEO James Bullard is here. Of course, we got a Federal Reserve meeting this month and we are expecting rates to move higher again.</p><p>House Judiciary Committee Member, California Congressman Darrell Issa is with us this morning, along with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz here as well. Big three hours ahead, don't miss moments of it.</p><p>Let's kick it off right here with this top story this hour and that is on the hot seat, Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee later this morning. That will set off a partisan battle over what is a consequential lifetime appointment.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham a member of the Judiciary Committee sounding off and confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed potentially with democratic votes as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER: If he does well at the hearing he will get -- my belief is he does well and I'm sure he will do well. I think there are a handful of democrats who will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know Dagen, you've got democrats from states that Trump won which people are expecting those states, those democrats actually vote yes for Kavanaugh, what do you say?</p><p>MCDOWELL: There are 10 democratic senators up for re-election in states that President Trump won. Half of those Trump won those states by double digits. The three to watch particularly are Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Joe Donnelly in Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota.</p><p>Why are we watching these three democrats? Because they all voted for Neil Gorsuch. They were the three senators who stepped up and gave a thumbs up to Gorsuch. But as the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page points out in a lengthy editorial titled, \"The Kavanaugh Hazing\" that democrats are going to use these hearings to try and drive people to the polls and try and drive votes coming up on the midterms. And they are going to portray a nightmare scenario that this man is put on the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. And they're raising the question of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Something that's been in place for 50 years which people are not expecting to -- has any movement whatsoever.</p><p>BRENBERG: Well -- and they're making this huge think about documents and access to documents which has really nothing to do this -- with this. When you think about somebody who's been the district court for 12 years, has 300 opinions under his belt, you know where he stands.</p><p>It's not hard to assess where he is, that's not the point for democrats, they simply want to score points in the midterm election and they're going to use this week as a grandstand to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love -- I love this outrage --</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's right. I think this -- this question of Roe v. Wade is an important one. You know, the rally big issue for a lot of people is will he uphold the presidents of the court or will he be willing to move them in another direction not just on Roe v. Wade but also on gay marriage. I think that's where he's going to be pressed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But hasn't he made suggestions already that he's not interested in changing something that's been in place for 650 years?</p><p>HILSENRATH: It sounds like -- it sounds like he has --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- in closed door meetings and now we have to see --</p><p>BRENBERG: And it's a -- and it's a John Roberts Court. He's not going to move the court. He cares very much about presidents. So, for that very reason I think it's less of an issue than democrats are making (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love this outrage over the documents. Meanwhile, we're still waiting on documents from the FBI and the DOJ. Congress is still waiting on all these documents for a year and a half right now and yet there's all this outrage over the documents over Brett Kavanaugh. And then there's -- go ahead Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. I was just going to say that -- so we -- on Trump Administration withheld 101,000 document pages entirely under executive privilege. Senators and their staff were allowed to view 147,000 or so in a secure room on Capitol Hill. This is very similar to how the Obama White House handled the documents for Elena Kagan when she was up for Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a good point. That's a very good point.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think there's two issues on the documents, one is he was a staff secretary. My understanding of that job is you control documents, your whole job is deciding what -- how documents are managed. So you could basically ask for all White House documents that came through his desk. That's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well Chuck Grassley did the -- but when he was the staff secretary in the White House, Chuck Grassley I do not believe actually asks for those documents to be even turned over because they would be under executive public.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But then there's another issue of how the -- how the U.S. treated prisoners and the whole war against Islamic terror, there's some questions on the democratic side about what position he took in the states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why they want to see the document.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And that's where -- I think that's where the -- a lot of contention is.</p><p>BRENBERG: But --</p><p>MCDOWELL: To your point, what these -- what the justices look at in terms of overturning why they will never overturn some of these major decisions because they look at, I think the legal term is (INAUDIBLE) where it's become part of our social fabric and the way that we live our lives.</p><p>Like Roe v. Wade for example or even Miranda, this is something the Journal writes about that Justice William Rehnquist was a critic of the 1966 decision but in 2000 he refused a chance to overturn the Miranda ruling because it become -- it had been universally in use for so long. So it becomes part of our everyday lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A part of the legal process.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But you see why when he said --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he said that repeatedly that this has been in place, he's not interested in changing something that's been in place for 50 years.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But that matters a lot to social conservatives. Don't they want -- don't social conservatives want to hear him say, \"Yes, I am going to move on Roe v. Wade.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know.</p><p>HILSENRATH: So I think everybody wants to hear what he has to say on it.</p><p>BRENBERG: I think the left is upset because they like to use the Supreme Court as a super congressional body to make law instead of interpret law.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>BRENBERG: And they know Kavanaugh is not somebody who will allow that to happen. It's not about what's happened in the past, it's about what they won't be able to get done in the future that's happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's such an important point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If democrats -- in -- if democrats in Congress want to make law that is progressive, then make law. Do not use the court to do that --</p><p>BRENBERG: Pass it through Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- to do that on your behalf because you're position is so weak you could never pass a law basically pushing us to the left.</p><p>BRENBERG: That's the central issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well all of this comes up this morning. The hearing begins I guess just after nine or --</p><p>MCDOWELL: 9:30a.m.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 9:30a.m. this morning. We will obviously have it live here for you, so stay with us on those hearings.</p><p>Turning to technology, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as well as Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are going to be testifying tomorrow in front of these Senate Intel Committee. They will answer questions about foreign use of social media to influence elections.</p><p>Separately, Mr. Dorsey will testify before the House Commerce Committee as you heard here first regarding the tribute of conservative voices on Twitter. Let's talk about this, what are we going to hear tomorrow from these technology chiefs tomorrow and from both of these --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, they're going to get it from every side. Conservatives feel, you know, that the conservative voices are being repressed on social media. Democrats are concerned about, you know, about Russian meddling and other meddling. So I think it's going to be -- it's going to be a tough couple of days for these executives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know it's interesting because conservatives usually do not want to see more government, more regulation in business, in free enterprise. And yet, these companies have become so big and so powerful more so than they expected initially, so what do you do?</p><p>BRENBERG: And they shouldn't want to see more involvement from the government here. But the problem is with Twitter especially, it looks like Dorsey is stepping in at the last moment and making decisions.</p><p>They don't have a process, they don't have clear guidelines, it looks personality-driven and conservatives look at that and say the personalities at the top are progressive liberal and that's why our voices are being -- are suffering here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're going to -- they're going to have to explain how they actually do decide when to take somebody off the platform. Dorsey's going to have to explain in detail how his platform actually ban certain voices, right?</p><p>HILSENRATH: And, you know -- and there's also the whole issue of privacy of how they're letting information out to -- you know, to the public.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How they make money off the backs of people's most private personal information because I don't think -- like particularly with Google. Google has a lot of explaining to do and I don't think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They keep blowing off the invitations, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And I don't think -- it's a question as to who shows up because Sundar Pichai that Senator Burr wanted the CEO of Google there, he's not going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's some question as to whether Larry Page shows up, that remains to be seen, one of the two founders of Google. But again, how much access they have to -- our -- the way that we behave online.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But we know they have a lot of access to it Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The interesting --</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that, you know, there are certain things that have been taken off these platforms and you have to scratch your head and say, why?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think this story is going away.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No way.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It's going to be with us -- it's going to be with us for a while and who knows if it ends up in some kind of anti-trust movement either in Congress or out of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: To break these companies up because they're too big.</p><p>HILSENRATH: To -- that's one thing. And then there's the question of, you know, rules of how they -- of how they deal with -- of how they deal with privacy and private (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'll -- but one thing I'll add because I raise this issue because Congress quite frankly let Facebook as one example get to the size that it is with the acquisition of, say, Instagram, number one.</p><p>Number two, it's interesting that Amazon is now moving deeper into the advertising space giving potentially Google a run for its money. That's really one thing that will also at the power of these platforms is if you have a lot more competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And there was one search engine that raised millions is recently DuckDuckGo. So you're seeing an effort at competition because that's what people would like, competition, as opposed to regulation.</p><p>BRENBERG: And ultimately that's the best regulator. But what's been interesting is we've been talking about this for a very long time. The big tech names have not been able to inspire confidence. They've been very bad upon their story that's why they're in this position right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Think until you make it. It's in their entire mantra.</p><p>BRENBERG: Not very good at faking it anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And, you know -- and, again, it come to bite them in the, well, where the sun doesn't shine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We got a lot coming up. Keep it right here for the live coverage of all of that, the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings starts at 9:30 this morning and then, of course, tomorrow on the technology testimonies as well.</p><p>We'll take a short break. When we come back, bracing for impact, Tropical Storm Gordon is now gaining strength as it marches toward the Gulf. We've got the very latest on the hurricane warning now in effect.</p><p>And then Nike take sides, the backlash after the company taps Colin Kaepernick for its Just Do It Campaign, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Bracing for impact, Gulf Coast states on high alert this morning as Tropical Storm Gordon is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning Maria. Gordon bearing down on the Gulf Coast overnight lashing South Florida with heavy rains and high winds. The storm expected to turn into a hurricane later today when it makes landfall.</p><p>Gordon whipping winds at 60 miles per hour causing flash flooding. Storm surge warnings also in effect right now, a hurricane warning put into effect as far north as Mississippi. As much as eight inches of rain could fall in some parts of the Gulf States through late Thursday which we should say that some of those rigs are already being shut down in the Gulf. Those oil rigs that, of course, watch here.</p><p>Well, billionaire CEO of JD.com Richard Liu is now back in China after being released by police in Minneapolis. He was arrested late Friday on suspicion of sexual misconduct. Details of the allegations have not been released and Liu is denying the claims. Police say the investigation is considered active and they are intense reactions in China.</p><p>News outlets and social media are certainly talking about his arrest. China's foreign minister says it is looking into the circumstances surrounding his arrest. JD.com is China's second largest online shopping site after Alibaba. Shares of the company trading lower by down -- down by more than three percent right now in the premarket actually.</p><p>Well, Nike is feeling the heat after naming former quarterback Colin Kaepernick the face of its 30th Just Do It Campaign. The new ad features the line \"Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.\" Nike customers are clearly not happy about the company getting political</p><p>Many videos being shared on social media, show people burning their Nike shoes as you can see in this video, that's one instance of many. But Nike, they're standing by their decision. They say, \"We believe Colin is one of the most inspirational athletes of this generation who has leveraged the power of sports to help move the world forward.\"</p><p>Kaepernick hasn't played in the NFL since the 2016 season, folks, when he began protesting on the field during the national anthem. And to kick it off, shares of Nike are down in the premarket, down more than half a percent Maria. Big news at Nike, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much Cheryl. Coming up, stock soaring to new highs, will the market run continue into autumn? We're breaking down what's important for markets coming up next. We got a Federal Reserve meeting coming up this month.</p><p>Then liberal backlash, the New Yorker uninviting Steve Bannon from its festival after a celebrity outcry. What Bannon is saying now, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, a lot happening in the couple of months ahead, that could be impactful for the market. Wall Street rallying as stocks are at. We're near record highs heading into the first trading day of the month.</p><p>Some investors though are fearing that the market could trade down in September, a historical volatile stretch for global markets. Joining us right now to walk through the catalyst for stocks, Mark Lehman is JMP Securities President. Mark, it's good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MARK LEHMAN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's going to be the big catalyst in your view for the markets in the fourth quarter?</p><p>LEHMAN: Well, you're going to see obviously third quarter earnings which will be interesting. You're going to see a bunch of IPOs. Post Labor Day you're going to see filing after filing. We saw one last week with SurveyMonkey which will obviously be an important bell weather for the tech market.</p><p>But you also have trade talks and, of course, 60 days away with the midterm elections. So there's lots to things for investors to be excited about and plenty for them to be worried about.</p><p>BRENBERG: We keep talking about trade and how it's going to affect markets and yet all summer the story has been, markets have shrugged. Why do you think they're going to care potentially coming up here in the fall or is it going to be another case where we think it's a big deal and it's not?</p><p>LEHMAN: Well, I think like most things we've been in kind of the denial and anger phase for a little bit. That's the way we start things and we're in the middle of kind of figuring things out. I think we're going to find out after a quarter or two of how these tariffs are looking and obviously between Canada and Mexico we're not quite sure how that's going to look in their biggest trade partners.</p><p>I think it's clarity comes into those places. But right now business is pretty good, I think people are on the sidelines deciding how it's going to -- how they're going to react. But I think right now we're still in the figuring out phase.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Mark, we know that 2018 earnings numbers are really good, you know, well into the double digits. What's 2019 looking like? What's 2020 looking like on the earnings front?</p><p>LEHMAN: You know, I think '19 -- this has been such a good year, you have such a good response from the tax cuts at least from earnings perspective. I think expecting a little bit of a down draft year-over-year. It's a lot large numbers will probably cause earnings to come down and expectations to be tempered.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how these numbers turn out. Obviously, '18 was supposed to be a good year, not a great year but it's been turn -- turning into a great year for earnings. I would expect '19 to be temper and we'll see how Wall Street reacts. Seeing the three percent bond or seeing an umbrella of a three percent bond puts a I think a real catalyst for earnings because that low rate continues to make people want to put more money in equities and I think that will continue into the fall and in 2019.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this has been the stock market rally that has had more naysayers than I can remember in recent history, people who have been doubters all along. The Wall Street Journal on its front page today talks about how global fund managers are holding higher than average levels of cash in their portfolios.</p><p>And even some major investment banks like Morgan Stanley have already recommended trimming their technology allocations. So that bodes well for the market the fact that people are what -- so worried about it.</p><p>LEHMAN: Well, you know, you can -- I've been on this show, I've called it the most disrespected bull market in history.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>LEHMAN: I think having people who don't believe ascribe to the high enough to buy theory of stocks which obviously I don't know that's Warren Buffett. I mean, people will have to have exposure and people are those fund managers you talk about are not supposed to be a fund manager of cash, they're supposed to money inactively manage it.</p><p>And I think as these stocks trade higher and earnings continue to accelerate you will see more of that belief and I think you're going to see more of that into the fall.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Isn't that skepticism a great thing? I mean the last two expansions were short circuited by over exuberance. If we have under exuberance right now, isn't that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was my point.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But that's what --</p><p>LEHMAN: (INAUDIBLE) no, I look -- I have been very --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. Really, he made it better than I did.</p><p>LEHMAN: Right. Well -- and listen --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But look at all these uncertainty that a Federal Reserve meeting this month the were expecting that the Fed raises rates in September, correct?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Uh-hmm. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got the midterm elections which can go either way, and of course, the uncertainty about trade.</p><p>LEHMAN: It's true. And I think people have continued to look at tech as kind of anomalous and tech is not anomalous. You know, people look at Amazon and saying, \"Wow, it's one of the great companies\" or \"Apple is one of the great companies.\"</p><p>Apple is far from being just a tech company, it's a healthcare company, it's an autonomous company, it's an entertainment company, it's a media company. You have all these parts of it and people are not really paying attention of the fact that these are much bigger than the narrowness of a tech company.</p><p>And I think you'll see this in the fall, you're going to see, again, SurveyMonkey's one of the companies, you're going to see a bunch of companies that you really want to pay attention to because that's where the growth of the economy is and the growth of the markets and I think you're going to continue to see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If you have all the supply, doesn't that hurt markets in terms of performance?</p><p>LEHMAN: Well, supply obviously is having that despite of any imbalances there. But listen, you have plenty of M&amp;A going on, you have lots of that already relative to previous peaks that we've been a part of. This is nothing compared to an IPO market in the past, nothing at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One thing I'll add really quickly, Sam Stovall said on the -- this program last week that in the fourth quarter of midterm election years the S&amp;P on average is up 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter and it's up 90 percent of the time. And that's some -- once that uncertainty falls away.</p><p>HILSENRATH: From his mouth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's amazing that the third the third quarter is up in just a couple of weeks.</p><p>LEHMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the earnings period will likely be dictating performance. Mark, great to have you. Thank you so much, good to see you always.</p><p>LEHMAN: Thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Lehman joining us there. Coming up, the founder of the notorious Taliban linked Haqqani network now dead. What it means for the war in terror in Afghanistan.</p><p>Plus, no college diploma, no problem. Apparently more big companies like Apple among others ditching college degree requirements for jobs, the impact next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, September 4th, your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Trade under President Trump, investors are reacting to the future of America's trade policies with Canada and China, the two uncertainties right now.</p><p>Futures are currently mixed. Take a look, indicating the market will open with the Dow, down about 20 points and the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ higher by a fraction. The Dow Industrials finishing lower on Friday, falling 22 points at the close, with the NASDAQ up 21 at the close.</p><p>This coming as the NASDAQ posted the biggest gain in August in 18 years. It was a good month for the month of August, for the NASDAQ, as you can see.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board. Take a look, FT-100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris, down better than one percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, down almost one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of Japan. It was down just a fraction.</p><p>Fighting for his life, a Georgia police officer is shot while responding to a shoplifting report at a Wal-Mart, the very latest developments, coming up.</p><p>Plus, a dis-invitation for Steve Bannon, the New Yorker Festival is dropping the former White House Chief Strategist after celebrities like Jim Carrey, Judd Apatow said they would not participate if Bannon remained on the schedule, the backlash, coming up.</p><p>And no college degree no problem, we're breaking down the major hiring shift for big-technology companies later this hour, where college degree may not be required any longer.</p><p>All that coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, the war on terror continues this morning, the Taliban, announcing earlier this morning that the leader of the notorious Haqqani network has died.</p><p>This comes as unnamed U.S. service member was killed in Afghanistan, and what the military is describing, as an insider attack, one other member was wounded.</p><p>Joining me to discuss that is retired four-star general, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane. General, it's always a pleasure, good to see you this morning.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Yes. Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on the developments here, the fact that this leader is now dead, does that change anything?</p><p>KEANE: Well, he's been an iconic leader for some time, he's been sick, he's elderly, he was paralyzed and he really was not involved in day to day operations. He turned that over to his son a year ago. But if anything, you know, his death just further commits the ideological fighters that the Haqqani people are, you know, to this -- to this cause that they have.</p><p>And so they're going to continue. This network has been a real thorn on the side of Afghanistan and U.S. forces ever since 2001. And the problem is that they take up residence inside Pakistan, in north western Pakistan, is where their bases are, and it's from those bases that they attack into Afghanistan and conduct operations against U.S. and Afghan forces.</p><p>They are responsible for most of these horrific suicide bombings that take place in Kabul. Recently, some of that has been done by ISIS, but over these last 17 years, Haqqani has done most of all of that.</p><p>Our problem has been this, Maria, we have never attacked the Haqqani network the way we did the Al-Qaeda network, which is also in north western Pakistan, why? Because the Pakistanis refused to let us do that, why is that? Because they absolutely support the Haqqani network, their intelligence service supports them.</p><p>We have evidence of the military providing training for them, they've given them logistics, they've given them resources, and this has been a horrific thing for 17 years. We are on our third president trying to do something about that, the past two failed miserably. This network continues to thrive and they continue to kill Afghans and Afghan people and U.S. soldiers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What is the state of this network, of ISIS right now, for a year and a half, we have been talking about ISIS being on the run. But recently, we're seeing issues of, in certain corners, where they are back, and now you've got this Taliban-linked network as well. Where are we, in the state, in terms of against terrorism, right now?</p><p>KEANE: Yes, well, first of all, the Al-Qaeda network is thriving and ISIS is thriving outside of Syria and Iraq, we did take their territory away from them. That was something that had to be done because that was a major recruiting tool for them and also a place where they could direct actions in other parts.</p><p>There's 30 affiliates that are outside of Syria and Iraq, and there's one that is a growing menace inside of Afghanistan. The Al-Qaeda itself, still -- their headquarters are still in north western Pakistan, and they have other networks in Africa, a significant one in Syria that they're about to conduct campaigns against.</p><p>But the radical Islamist Global Jihad is out there and is doing well. We've been at this for 17 years and the fact is, if we are totally honest with ourselves, despite all of our efforts this -- there has been expansion in their capabilities over these years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Let me -- let me zero in on Syria, because the President has made it clear, this weekend, he will not tolerate an assault from President Bashar al-Assad and his allies on rebel fighters in the Idlib Province.</p><p>Here's yesterday's tweet from the President and he says, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don't let that happen. The President writes.</p><p>This comes after Iran's foreign minister said that terrorists must be purged from the region. What do you make of the President's strategy in such a volatile region?</p><p>KEANE: You know, what's happening here has set the -- set the framework for everybody. The Iranians and the Russians successfully propped up the Assad regime. And what they've been doing -- and that began with the Russians in 2015. And what they've been doing this last year or so, is consolidating those gains.</p><p>And this is one of the last opposition forces strongholds in Idlib Province. The problem is, there are about 3 million people and residents there. Now, these fighters are largely Al-Qaeda fighters and there's about 10,000 of them strong, and some other few thousands of other fighters there as well.</p><p>This is -- this is the most fiercest, toughest of the opposition forces that the Assad regime will have to deal with and that's why they have put this off as long as they have. The Turks are also trying to deter this from happening and they moved some forces down into northern Syria.</p><p>The President is using some rhetoric to do that. But to be frank about it, we have very little leverage, in Syria, to stop this. They're in the planning and preparation phase, I do believe they eventually will execute this at some point. We will know when the campaign begins because the bombing will begin.</p><p>And believe me, the Russians do most of the bombing in Syria, they've been doing that for well over a year now. And their way of war here is the same way that Putin made war in Chechnya, in a place called Grozny, the inside of Chechnya in 2000.</p><p>And that is to go in there, where conventional bombs and eliminate as much of the population as possible, thereby depriving the terrorists as they call them, or insurgence from support from the people and obviously, killing terrorists as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>KEANE: But the objective for the Russians will be as it is for Assad, to go kill as many people as we possibly can, destroy their homes, destroy their facilities, destroy their hospitals, destroy their warehouses, taking much all of their quality of life away from them, and thus -- therefore, dry up the terrorist support that they're getting from the people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Still, such an incredibly dangerous situation, General. Let me switch gears because this week, one of the big issues will likely be the trade issues between China and the U.S., we actually could see the U.S. impose that additional $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, this Thursday, the 6th, and we are waiting on that.</p><p>What's your take on where we are with China and also the trade story around Canada as the U.S. successfully does a deal with Mexico, and now awaits China's -- Canada's participation, rather, so China and Canada, the unknowns?</p><p>KEANE: Yes. Well, I think the major issue certainly is China. Canada is a major trading partner as well. But I generally agree that taking on these trade imbalances is the right thing to do and try to fix some of it as much as possible.</p><p>We've obviously had some success with the European Union. We'll have to see the final result of that, at least that's been the goal, the goal to zero tariffs that would be really something that we could do internationally, unlikely to be sure.</p><p>But listen, China has been conducting economic warfare on the United States and our allies for years and it's about time that somebody is calling them on this, not just the trade imbalance but the incredible amount of intellectual property theft, the incredible amount of cyber espionage that's taking place.</p><p>We are on a collision course with China, not just economically, but also in terms of what their militarization of the Western Pacific, their geopolitical goals, all at the expense of the -- of the United States. The president maintains public diplomacy, you know, President Xi is my friend, we've got a great relationship.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>KEANE: And that's fine, but the team that's working beneath him, his economic team, and also his national security team, very clear eyed about China, they know that they are a major obstacle to the United States interest around the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Obstacles, but now, also an issue for the North Korea story, so now we know for sure that the trade issues between the U.S. and China have begun to impact the general discussion about denuclearization in North Korea, China teaming up with North Korea, and the President basically calling back Pompeo from even going to North Korea because of it.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, that occurs as a result of some original letter we received from the North Korean official prior to the visit, and the President read that attitude as much as he saw an attitude change just prior to the Singapore Summit and he cancelled it.</p><p>He's using that cancellation of the visit as leverage. We'll see if that attitude changes. We are just waiting for the North Koreans to do something positive on denuclearization, which they have not done to date. And I think that we'll give them a little bit more rope there.</p><p>But the President and his team are running out of rope, frankly, and after a number of weeks, they are going to have to start slapping sanctions, harder sanctions on North Korea. And here is the big one, because China has opened up the aperture and has provided some sanction relief to North Korea ever since the Singapore Summit.</p><p>If they don't stop that, we'll going to have to sanction China as well, we'll have to go after some of their banking systems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, all right, more will be revealed here. General, it's good to talk to you as always. Thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: General Jack Keane, there. Coming up, a Georgia police officer is fighting for his life this morning, after being shot in the head while responding to a shoplifting call at Wal-Mart, the very latest on his condition, coming up.</p><p>Then, liberal backlash, the New Yorker uninviting Steve Bannon from its festival, after celebrities outcries, what Bannon is now saying, next, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, a police officer is fighting for his life this morning after he was shot in the head. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Maria, 34-year-old officer Matt Cooper was responding to a call of men shoplifting bandanas at a Walmart, near Atlanta. He was shot while he was chasing a suspect across the street. The suspect then killed himself; two others are in custody. The six-year veteran on the force is in serious condition this morning. He's also an army veteran, a husband, and a father of two.</p><p>Well, Steve Bannon has been dropped from the annual New Yorker festival after liberal outrage. The former White House adviser was disinvited from the event after several celebrities, including Jim Carry, Patton Oswalt, and Judd Apatow said they would boycott the festival if Bannon showed up. Well, Bannon responded in a statement, he called David Remnick, the Editor of the New Yorker gutless.</p><p>Well, \"Crazy Rich Asians\" continues to dominate theaters for third weekend in a row.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We can't afford this. So, your family is rich.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're comfortable.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That is exactly what a super-rich person would say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The movie brought in just over $22 million. Its domestic gross now totals over 110 million -- forget the global box office, it's bigger. Also, for the third weekend in a row, \"The Meg\" made $10.5 million. That scary thriller is still doing well. Third place, \"Mission Impossible: Fallout\" with $7 million. Rounding up the top five: \"Operation Finale\" and \"Searching,\" each earned about 6 million. Maria, back to \"Mission Impossible: Fallout\" topped the international box office this weekend. $77.3 million in China, global take at 649. Tom Cruise is 56-years-old, maybe this bodes for the \"Top Gun\" sequel that's going to be coming out soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see about that. I got to see \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" that is good.</p><p>CASONE: I know. Me too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, no college diploma, apparently no problem. More big companies such as Google, Apple, they're ditching college degree requirements for jobs. We've got that story coming up right after this short break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. No diploma, no problem, apparently. More and more companies are scrapping degree requirements for jobs those degrees of college. Lauren Simonetti with all the details now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hey, great to see you. I know. No B.A., no problem is what the companies are saying. They're not saying don't go get a college degree, they're just saying if you don't have one, it's not going to be a barrier for you to work in certain jobs at our company. So, what are these 15 major companies that's saying no B.A. is totally fine? Nordstrom, Bank of America, (INAUDIBLE), Apple, Google, IBM, you might not expect to see some of those names on that list, and they're doing this as we get the August job report -- it comes down on Friday. But we do have the numbers from July. The national unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, it is going down and it is going down among those who do not have college degrees.</p><p>If you look at those with high school diplomas, the unemployment rate in July went down to four percent. And if you look at those with less than a high school diploma, it went from one year ago, seven percent to 5.1 percent now. That's not terrible. The big question is why is this happening? Is it that college is too expense with the average tuition and fees for private school about $32,000 and we're graduating with a combined, what, $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, or is it that -- and you might know the answer to this, Brian -- the colleges aren't preparing and training the students (INAUDIBLE) as workers, whether it's coding, or some of the vocational skills, have we lowered our standards, what's the problem right now?</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're a college professor. You can't be happy about this.</p><p>BRENBERG: No, actually I am happy about it. Because, look, the fact is, for many, many students they're going to college for four, five, six years. If they're getting out, when they're getting out with a degree, they don't have the skills that employers want and employers are just saying, if we're going through that process and you're going to spend that kind of money? Forget about it. Come work for us.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So, it's the school's problems.</p><p>BRENBERG: Yes. I mean, in so many cases, these degree programs aren't preparing them to add value in the workplace, they're not teaching how to be good professionals, they are sitting in classrooms, they're hearing ideological rants; walking with a distorted view of reality. Come on, why would a company want to hire somebody like that?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, not only that, but they're taking on thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of debt --</p><p>BRENBERG: Which makes it even worse.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- to get all of that. And I think a lot of people on the worker side are saying, do I need to go through all of this and take on all of this debt to be prepared for the workplace? But on the other side I think, you know, you said there's a 3.9 percent unemployment rate. That is really the crux of the whole thing; the worker shortages in industries all across the economy and companies are saying, well, you know, maybe we don't need college graduates for this job or that job, maybe we need to broaden our horizon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point. Big worker shortage right now in truck drivers. Amazon needs truck drivers. Construction.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Home care aid.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Even financial advisers. As people get older, as this generation gets older, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I've been an advocate for -- my brother and I, for years, have had this conversation, if we could go back and do it again we would out of high school try to go and work for a major corporation and get on the job training. Because ultimately, it keeps you -- people are literally spending a quarter of a million dollars for an education and social justice, and gender pronounce. That's what they -- that's what the people at these liberal arts colleges are worried about. And if more of these technology companies start educating people right out of high school, find smart kids and basically make them sign a contract say, you know, we'll teach you -- give you on the job training, you're going to work here for five years and you can go up and do whatever you want.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Having said all of this -- Brian, I'm sure you can speak to this, the research shows, unequivocally, that people with college degrees fare much better in life. Your lifetime earnings are much higher if you have a college degree than if you --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a really important point.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- encouraging people to skip college altogether.</p><p>BRENBERG: That doesn't imply causation; it's the reason they're getting these jobs because they went to college, would they get them anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. All good questions. Lauren, great to see you. Thank you so much, Lauren Simonetti. Still ahead, Nike takes side. The backlash after the company taps Colin Kaepernick for its \"Just Do It\" campaign, next hour, right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, September 4th. Your top stories right now just after 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We're going to say good morning to Maria Bartiromo.  Good to  see you.  Welcome back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there ladies, thanks so  much.  Great to be back.  Good morning everybody, welcome back from the  summertime.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday September  4th.  Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors have a lot to keep their eyes on this week between waiting for a  trade deal with Canada and expected tariffs on more Chinese goods.  Plus,  news on the political front.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Futures this morning showing the markets will open mix.  Dow Industrials  down about 20 points right now.  Fractional moves on the upside though for  the S&amp;P500, up almost one point and the NASDAQ up eight and a half right  now.</p><p> This after a mixed close on Friday for the major indices, take a look at  Friday's performance, August, still finishing in the green though despite  Friday's decline of about 22 points on the Dow.  S&amp;P and the NASDAQ were up  as you can see.  The Dow adding just over two percent for the month of  August, the S&amp;P500 was up three percent for the month of August, and the  NASDAQ is the big winner with an additional 5.7 percent move for the month  of August alone.</p><p> Check out markets in Europe this morning, take a look, we are looking at a  down session with the FT-100 down 11 points, CAC Quarante down about 55,  better than one percent, and the DAX Index in Germany down almost one  percent despite reports that President Trump is ready to drop another round  of tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods as early as this week.</p><p> Asian markets finished mostly in positive territory overnight with the  exception of Japan.  Nikkei Average down just marginally.</p><p> Here comes the judge, Brett Kavanaugh is set to be begin Senate  confirmation hearings today, this as the Trump Administration announced  that it will withhold more than 100,000 pages of documents on Kavanaugh.   They say that the documents are protected by constitutional privilege.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> AL D'AMATO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  His records speaks for itself.  So those  who raise questions now about 100,000 documents, et cetera, that they'd  like to see when he works for the White House years ago, you know, that's  just an attempt to slowdown the proceedings to embarrass him.  But his  record is going to carry him through.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The administration did release more than 42,000 pages on  Kavanaugh just yesterday.  </p><p> Extreme weather to report, Tropical Storm Gordon is now barrowing toward  the Gulf Coast.  The very latest on Gordon's move.</p><p> Then outrage after Colin Kaepernick was named the new face of Nike, the  backlash coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it  all down, our own Dagen McDowell.  The Wall Street Journal's Global  Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.  And Kings College Business and Economics  Professor Brian Brenberg.  Great to see you.</p><p> BRIAN BRENBERG, BUSINESS ECONOMICS PROFESSOR, KING'S COLLEGE:  Good  morning.  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back from the summer.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to be back.  I missed you.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I missed you so much.  But  you're the hardest worker and woman in the news business, so you deserve  some time off.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I am dying to hear what you think about everything that's  going on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So much going on.  Jon, it's good to see you again.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  It is good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A lot on the economic front as well.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Lot to talk about on trade.  We have a great story on paper  today on the dairy market.  I was going to send this to you over the  weekend Dagen.  A good points and hypocrisy on both sides about dairy  trade, is it the center of U.S.-Canada trade arguments right now?  And both  sides are rigging our dairy markets, so we should -- and our viewers should  take a look at that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And look what I've printed out this morning, \"Why Milk Matters?\"   The U.S. and Canada trade fight.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I knew Dagen was going to (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There is apparently a -- again, this is why it's not that big of  a stumbling block I don't think in the -- in the negotiations with Canada  to be part of the NAFTA rewrite because we actually benefit from the  current policy in Canada.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  We're running a trade surplus.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  $650 million trade surplus on dairy.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  We're actually dumping surplus milk into Canada and we want to  be able to dump more.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see.  I mean, the -- a deal with Mexico is, what, a  handshake?  I mean, it's done.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will Canada follow up soon?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, that's the big question.  And then there was an  interesting episode last week where the president had an interview with  Bloomberg News and somehow it leaked out.  He -- where he made some  comments off the record saying he's not going to give Canada any ground  whatsoever and they either have to take it or leave, so let's see.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing that Jon pointed out last week though that in order to  get fast-track status on this trade and that is pass it with just a simple  majority instead of 60 votes in the Senate, Canada according to, like,  Senator Toomey for example, he says among others that Canada has to be part  of it to get fast-track approval.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  And the president was tweeting about this week --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Congress has to sign off on this.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- he was tweeting to Congress, \"Stay out of this, take  whatever deal I give you.\"  Or else -- he's saying he's going to pull out  of all these trade deals.</p><p> BRENBERG:  But the fact is it makes zero sense from Canada's perspective to  not get something done.  If they didn't get something done, they would be  the big losers in this.  That's why ultimately I think they'll come the  president's way and get something done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very important point.  I think I agree with you.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's why dairy matters so much because if they get the wrong  side of the dairy deal, it's a very politically powerful industry and  particularly in Quebec and we'll have to see how much they dig their heels  in on that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got a lot on that coming up, that's one of the key  stories of course.  Joining the conversation this morning, St. Louis  Federal Reserve President and CEO James Bullard is here.  Of course, we got  a Federal Reserve meeting this month and we are expecting rates to move  higher again.</p><p> House Judiciary Committee Member, California Congressman Darrell Issa is  with us this morning, along with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.   Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz here as well.  Big three  hours ahead, don't miss moments of it.</p><p> Let's kick it off right here with this top story this hour and that is on  the hot seat, Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh goes before the Senate  Judiciary Committee later this morning.  That will set off a partisan  battle over what is a consequential lifetime appointment.  </p><p> Senator Lindsey Graham a member of the Judiciary Committee sounding off and  confident that Kavanaugh will be confirmed potentially with democratic  votes as well.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Does he have the votes to win confirmation of the  court?</p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  If he does  well at the hearing he will get -- my belief is he does well and I'm sure  he will do well.  I think there are a handful of democrats who will vote  for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know Dagen, you've got democrats from states that Trump won  which people are expecting those states, those democrats actually vote yes  for Kavanaugh, what do you say?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There are 10 democratic senators up for re-election in states  that President Trump won.  Half of those Trump won those states by double  digits.  The three to watch particularly are Joe Manchin in West Virginia,  Joe Donnelly in Indiana, and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota.</p><p> Why are we watching these three democrats?  Because they all voted for Neil  Gorsuch.  They were the three senators who stepped up and gave a thumbs up  to Gorsuch.  But as the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page points out in a  lengthy editorial titled, \"The Kavanaugh Hazing\" that democrats are going  to use these hearings to try and drive people to the polls and try and  drive votes coming up on the midterms.  And they are going to portray a  nightmare scenario that this man is put on the Supreme Court.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And they're raising the question of Roe v. Wade.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Something that's been in place for 50 years which people are  not expecting to -- has any movement whatsoever.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Well -- and they're making this huge think about documents and  access to documents which has really nothing to do this -- with this.  When  you think about somebody who's been the district court for 12 years, has  300 opinions under his belt, you know where he stands.</p><p> It's not hard to assess where he is, that's not the point for democrats,  they simply want to score points in the midterm election and they're going  to use this week as a grandstand to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love -- I love this outrage --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's right.  I think this -- this question of Roe v. Wade is  an important one.  You know, the rally big issue for a lot of people is  will he uphold the presidents of the court or will he be willing to move  them in another direction not just on Roe v. Wade but also on gay marriage.   I think that's where he's going to be pressed.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But hasn't he made suggestions already that he's not interested  in changing something that's been in place for 650 years?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  It sounds like -- it sounds like he has --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- in closed door meetings and now we have to see --</p><p> BRENBERG:  And it's a -- and it's a John Roberts Court.  He's not going to  move the court.  He cares very much about presidents.  So, for that very  reason I think it's less of an issue than democrats are making (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I love this outrage over the documents.  Meanwhile, we're still  waiting on documents from the FBI and the DOJ.  Congress is still waiting  on all these documents for a year and a half right now and yet there's all  this outrage over the documents over Brett Kavanaugh.  And then there's --  go ahead Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  I was just going to say that -- so we -- on Trump  Administration withheld 101,000 document pages entirely under executive  privilege.  Senators and their staff were allowed to view 147,000 or so in  a secure room on Capitol Hill.  This is very similar to how the Obama White  House handled the documents for Elena Kagan when she was up for Congress.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a good point.  That's a very good point.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think there's two issues on the documents, one is he was a  staff secretary.  My understanding of that job is you control documents,  your whole job is deciding what -- how documents are managed.  So you could  basically ask for all White House documents that came through his desk.   That's (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well Chuck Grassley did the -- but when he was the staff  secretary in the White House, Chuck Grassley I do not believe actually asks  for those documents to be even turned over because they would be under  executive public.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But then there's another issue of how the -- how the U.S.  treated prisoners and the whole war against Islamic terror, there's some  questions on the democratic side about what position he took in the states.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why they want to see the document.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  And that's where -- I think that's where the -- a lot of  contention is.</p><p> BRENBERG:  But --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  To your point, what these -- what the justices look at in terms  of overturning why they will never overturn some of these major decisions  because they look at, I think the legal term is (INAUDIBLE) where it's  become part of our social fabric and the way that we live our lives.</p><p> Like Roe v. Wade for example or even Miranda, this is something the Journal  writes about that Justice William Rehnquist was a critic of the 1966  decision but in 2000 he refused a chance to overturn the Miranda ruling  because it become -- it had been universally in use for so long.  So it  becomes part of our everyday lives.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A part of the legal process.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But you see why when he said --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And he said that repeatedly that this has been in place, he's  not interested in changing something that's been in place for 50 years.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But that matters a lot to social conservatives.  Don't they  want -- don't social conservatives want to hear him say, \"Yes, I am going  to move on Roe v. Wade.\"  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't know.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  So I think everybody wants to hear what he has to say on it.</p><p> BRENBERG:  I think the left is upset because they like to use the Supreme  Court as a super congressional body to make law instead of interpret law.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> BRENBERG:  And they know Kavanaugh is not somebody who will allow that to  happen.  It's not about what's happened in the past, it's about what they  won't be able to get done in the future that's happening.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's such an important point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If democrats -- in -- if democrats in Congress want to make law  that is progressive, then make law.  Do not use the court to do that --</p><p> BRENBERG:  Pass it through Congress.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- to do that on your behalf because you're position is so weak  you could never pass a law basically pushing us to the left.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  That's the central issue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well all of this comes up this morning.  The hearing begins I  guess just after nine or --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  9:30a.m. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  9:30a.m. this morning.  We will obviously have it live here for  you, so stay with us on those hearings.</p><p> Turning to technology, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as well as Facebook's Chief  Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are going to be testifying tomorrow in  front of these Senate Intel Committee.  They will answer questions about  foreign use of social media to influence elections.</p><p> Separately, Mr. Dorsey will testify before the House Commerce Committee as  you heard here first regarding the tribute of conservative voices on  Twitter.  Let's talk about this, what are we going to hear tomorrow from  these technology chiefs tomorrow and from both of these --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, they're going to get it from every side.  Conservatives  feel, you know, that the conservative voices are being repressed on social  media.  Democrats are concerned about, you know, about Russian meddling and  other meddling.  So I think it's going to be -- it's going to be a tough  couple of days for these executives.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know it's interesting because conservatives usually do not  want to see more government, more regulation in business, in free  enterprise.  And yet, these companies have become so big and so powerful  more so than they expected initially, so what do you do?</p><p> BRENBERG:  And they shouldn't want to see more involvement from the  government here.  But the problem is with Twitter especially, it looks like  Dorsey is stepping in at the last moment and making decisions.</p><p> They don't have a process, they don't have clear guidelines, it looks  personality-driven and conservatives look at that and say the personalities  at the top are progressive liberal and that's why our voices are being --  are suffering here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're going to -- they're going to have to explain how they  actually do decide when to take somebody off the platform.  Dorsey's going  to have to explain in detail how his platform actually ban certain voices,  right?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  And, you know -- and there's also the whole issue of privacy  of how they're letting information out to -- you know, to the public.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How they make money off the backs of people's most private  personal information because I don't think -- like particularly with  Google.  Google has a lot of explaining to do and I don't think --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They keep blowing off the invitations, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I don't think -- it's a question as to who shows up  because Sundar Pichai that Senator Burr wanted the CEO of Google there,  he's not going.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's some question as to whether Larry Page shows up, that  remains to be seen, one of the two founders of Google.  But again, how much  access they have to -- our -- the way that we behave online.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But we know they have a lot of access to it Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The interesting --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We know that, you know, there are certain things that have been  taken off these platforms and you have to scratch your head and say, why?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I don't think this story is going away.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No way.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  It's going to be with us -- it's going to be with us for a  while and who knows if it ends up in some kind of anti-trust movement  either in Congress or out of --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  To break these companies up because they're too big.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  To -- that's one thing.  And then there's the question of, you  know, rules of how they -- of how they deal with -- of how they deal with  privacy and private (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I'll -- but one thing I'll add because I raise this issue  because Congress quite frankly let Facebook as one example get to the size  that it is with the acquisition of, say, Instagram, number one. </p><p> Number two, it's interesting that Amazon is now moving deeper into the  advertising space giving potentially Google a run for its money.  That's  really one thing that will also at the power of these platforms is if you  have a lot more competition.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And there was one search engine that raised millions is  recently DuckDuckGo.  So you're seeing an effort at competition because  that's what people would like, competition, as opposed to regulation.</p><p> BRENBERG:  And ultimately that's the best regulator.  But what's been  interesting is we've been talking about this for a very long time.  The big  tech names have not been able to inspire confidence.  They've been very bad  upon their story that's why they're in this position right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Think until you make it.  It's in their entire mantra.</p><p> BRENBERG:  Not very good at faking it anymore.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And, you know -- and, again, it come to bite them in the, well,  where the sun doesn't shine.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We got a lot coming up.  Keep it right here for the  live coverage of all of that, the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings starts at  9:30 this morning and then, of course, tomorrow on the technology  testimonies as well.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  When we come back, bracing for impact, Tropical  Storm Gordon is now gaining strength as it marches toward the Gulf.  We've  got the very latest on the hurricane warning now in effect.</p><p> And then Nike take sides, the backlash after the company taps Colin  Kaepernick for its Just Do It Campaign, back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Bracing for impact, Gulf Coast states on high  alert this morning as Tropical Storm Gordon is expected to strengthen into  a hurricane.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning Maria.  Gordon  bearing down on the Gulf Coast overnight lashing South Florida with heavy  rains and high winds.  The storm expected to turn into a hurricane later  today when it makes landfall.</p><p> Gordon whipping winds at 60 miles per hour causing flash flooding.  Storm  surge warnings also in effect right now, a hurricane warning put into  effect as far north as Mississippi.  As much as eight inches of rain could  fall in some parts of the Gulf States through late Thursday which we should  say that some of those rigs are already being shut down in the Gulf.  Those  oil rigs that, of course, watch here.</p><p> Well, billionaire CEO of JD.com Richard Liu is now back in China after  being released by police in Minneapolis.  He was arrested late Friday on  suspicion of sexual misconduct.  Details of the allegations have not been  released and Liu is denying the claims.  Police say the investigation is  considered active and they are intense reactions in China.</p><p> News outlets and social media are certainly talking about his arrest.   China's foreign minister says it is looking into the circumstances  surrounding his arrest.  JD.com is China's second largest online shopping  site after Alibaba.  Shares of the company trading lower by down -- down by  more than three percent right now in the premarket actually.</p><p> Well, Nike is feeling the heat after naming former quarterback Colin  Kaepernick the face of its 30th Just Do It Campaign.  The new ad features  the line \"Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything.\"   Nike customers are clearly not happy about the company getting political</p><p> Many videos being shared on social media, show people burning their Nike  shoes as you can see in this video, that's one instance of many.  But Nike,  they're standing by their decision.  They say, \"We believe Colin is one of  the most inspirational athletes of this generation who has leveraged the  power of sports to help move the world forward.\"</p><p> Kaepernick hasn't played in the NFL since the 2016 season, folks, when he  began protesting on the field during the national anthem.  And to kick it  off, shares of Nike are down in the premarket, down more than half a  percent Maria.  Big news at Nike, back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much Cheryl.  Coming up, stock soaring  to new highs, will the market run continue into autumn?  We're breaking  down what's important for markets coming up next.  We got a Federal Reserve  meeting coming up this month.</p><p> Then liberal backlash, the New Yorker uninviting Steve Bannon from its  festival after a celebrity outcry.  What Bannon is saying now, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, a lot happening in the couple of months  ahead, that could be impactful for the market.  Wall Street rallying as  stocks are at.  We're near record highs heading into the first trading day  of the month.</p><p> Some investors though are fearing that the market could trade down in  September, a historical volatile stretch for global markets.  Joining us  right now to walk through the catalyst for stocks, Mark Lehman is JMP  Securities President.  Mark, it's good to see you, thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p> MARK LEHMAN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's going to be the big catalyst in your view for the  markets in the fourth quarter?</p><p> LEHMAN:  Well, you're going to see obviously third quarter earnings which  will be interesting.  You're going to see a bunch of IPOs.  Post Labor Day  you're going to see filing after filing.  We saw one last week with  SurveyMonkey which will obviously be an important bell weather for the tech  market.</p><p> But you also have trade talks and, of course, 60 days away with the midterm  elections.  So there's lots to things for investors to be excited about and  plenty for them to be worried about.</p><p> BRENBERG:  We keep talking about trade and how it's going to affect markets  and yet all summer the story has been, markets have shrugged.  Why do you  think they're going to care potentially coming up here in the fall or is it  going to be another case where we think it's a big deal and it's not?</p><p> LEHMAN:  Well, I think like most things we've been in kind of the denial  and anger phase for a little bit.  That's the way we start things and we're  in the middle of kind of figuring things out.  I think we're going to find  out after a quarter or two of how these tariffs are looking and obviously  between Canada and Mexico we're not quite sure how that's going to look in  their biggest trade partners.</p><p> I think it's clarity comes into those places.  But right now business is  pretty good, I think people are on the sidelines deciding how it's going to  -- how they're going to react.  But I think right now we're still in the  figuring out phase.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Mark, we know that 2018 earnings numbers are really good, you  know, well into the double digits.  What's 2019 looking like?  What's 2020  looking like on the earnings front?</p><p> LEHMAN:  You know, I think '19 -- this has been such a good year, you have  such a good response from the tax cuts at least from earnings perspective.   I think expecting a little bit of a down draft year-over-year.  It's a lot  large numbers will probably cause earnings to come down and expectations to  be tempered.</p><p> It will be interesting to see how these numbers turn out.  Obviously, '18  was supposed to be a good year, not a great year but it's been turn --  turning into a great year for earnings.  I would expect '19 to be temper  and we'll see how Wall Street reacts.  Seeing the three percent bond or seeing an umbrella of a three percent bond  puts a I think a real catalyst for earnings because that low rate continues  to make people want to put more money in equities and I think that will  continue into the fall and in 2019.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But this has been the stock market rally that has had more  naysayers than I can remember in recent history, people who have been  doubters all along.  The Wall Street Journal on its front page today talks  about how global fund managers are holding higher than average levels of  cash in their portfolios.</p><p> And even some major investment banks like Morgan Stanley have already  recommended trimming their technology allocations.  So that bodes well for  the market the fact that people are what -- so worried about it.</p><p> LEHMAN:  Well, you know, you can -- I've been on this show, I've called it  the most disrespected bull market in history.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> LEHMAN:  I think having people who don't believe ascribe to the high enough  to buy theory of stocks which obviously I don't know that's Warren Buffett.   I mean, people will have to have exposure and people are those fund  managers you talk about are not supposed to be a fund manager of cash,  they're supposed to money inactively manage it.</p><p> And I think as these stocks trade higher and earnings continue to  accelerate you will see more of that belief and I think you're going to see  more of that into the fall.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Isn't that skepticism a great thing?  I mean the last two  expansions were short circuited by over exuberance.  If we have under  exuberance right now, isn't that --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was my point.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But that's what -- </p><p> LEHMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) no, I look -- I have been very --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  Really, he made it better than I did.</p><p> LEHMAN:  Right.  Well -- and listen --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But look at all these uncertainty that a Federal Reserve  meeting this month the were expecting that the Fed raises rates in  September, correct?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Uh-hmm.  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You've got the midterm elections which can go either way, and  of course, the uncertainty about trade.  </p><p> LEHMAN:  It's true.  And I think people have continued to look at tech as  kind of anomalous and tech is not anomalous.  You know, people look at  Amazon and saying, \"Wow, it's one of the great companies\" or \"Apple is one  of the great companies.\"</p><p>Apple is far from being just a tech company, it's a healthcare company,  it's an autonomous company, it's an entertainment company, it's a media  company.  You have all these parts of it and people are not really paying  attention of the fact that these are much bigger than the narrowness of a  tech company.</p><p> And I think you'll see this in the fall, you're going to see, again,  SurveyMonkey's one of the companies, you're going to see a bunch of  companies that you really want to pay attention to because that's where the  growth of the economy is and the growth of the markets and I think you're  going to continue to see that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  If you have all the supply, doesn't that hurt markets in terms  of performance?</p><p> LEHMAN:  Well, supply obviously is having that despite of any imbalances  there.  But listen, you have plenty of M&amp;A going on, you have lots of that  already relative to previous peaks that we've been a part of.  This is  nothing compared to an IPO market in the past, nothing at all.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing I'll add really quickly, Sam Stovall said on the --  this program last week that in the fourth quarter of midterm election years  the S&amp;P on average is up 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter and it's up 90  percent of the time.  And that's some -- once that uncertainty falls away.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  From his mouth.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's amazing that the third the third quarter is up in just a  couple of weeks.</p><p> LEHMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the earnings period will likely be dictating performance.   Mark, great to have you.  Thank you so much, good to see you always.</p><p> LEHMAN:  Thanks so much.  Appreciate it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mark Lehman joining us there.  Coming up, the founder of the  notorious Taliban linked Haqqani network now dead.  What it means for the  war in terror in Afghanistan.</p><p> Plus, no college diploma, no problem.  Apparently more big companies like  Apple among others ditching college degree requirements for jobs, the  impact next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, September 4th,  your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Trade under President Trump, investors are reacting to the future of  America's trade policies with Canada and China, the two uncertainties right  now.  </p><p> Futures are currently mixed.  Take a look, indicating the market will open  with the Dow, down about 20 points and the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ higher by  a fraction.  The Dow Industrials finishing lower on Friday, falling 22  points at the close, with the NASDAQ up 21 at the close.</p><p> This coming as the NASDAQ posted the biggest gain in August in 18 years.   It was a good month for the month of August, for the NASDAQ, as you can  see.</p><p> In Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  Take a look,  FT-100 down a quarter of a percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris, down better  than one percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, down almost one percent.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, markets closed mostly higher, with the exception of  Japan.  It was down just a fraction.  </p><p> Fighting for his life, a Georgia police officer is shot while responding to  a shoplifting report at a Wal-Mart, the very latest developments, coming  up.</p><p> Plus, a dis-invitation for Steve Bannon, the New Yorker Festival is  dropping the former White House Chief Strategist after celebrities like Jim  Carrey, Judd Apatow said they would not participate if Bannon remained on  the schedule, the backlash, coming up.</p><p> And no college degree no problem, we're breaking down the major hiring  shift for big-technology companies later this hour, where college degree  may not be required any longer.</p><p> All that coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an  hour, the war on terror continues this morning, the Taliban, announcing  earlier this morning that the leader of the notorious Haqqani network has  died.</p><p> This comes as unnamed U.S. service member was killed in Afghanistan, and  what the military is describing, as an insider attack, one other member was  wounded.  </p><p> Joining me to discuss that is retired four-star general, Fox News Senior  Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane.  General, it's always a pleasure,  good to see you this morning.</p><p> GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes.  Good to  see you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the developments here, the fact that this  leader is now dead, does that change anything?</p><p> KEANE:  Well, he's been an iconic leader for some time, he's been sick,  he's elderly, he was paralyzed and he really was not involved in day to day  operations.  He turned that over to his son a year ago.  But if anything,  you know, his death just further commits the ideological fighters that the  Haqqani people are, you know, to this -- to this cause that they have.  </p><p> And so they're going to continue.  This network has been a real thorn on  the side of Afghanistan and U.S. forces ever since 2001.  And the problem  is that they take up residence inside Pakistan, in north western Pakistan,  is where their bases are, and it's from those bases that they attack into  Afghanistan and conduct operations against U.S. and Afghan forces.</p><p> They are responsible for most of these horrific suicide bombings that take  place in Kabul.  Recently, some of that has been done by ISIS, but over  these last 17 years, Haqqani has done most of all of that.  </p><p> Our problem has been this, Maria, we have never attacked the Haqqani  network the way we did the Al-Qaeda network, which is also in north western  Pakistan, why?  Because the Pakistanis refused to let us do that, why is  that?  Because they absolutely support the Haqqani network, their  intelligence service supports them.  </p><p> We have evidence of the military providing training for them, they've given  them logistics, they've given them resources, and this has been a horrific  thing for 17 years.  We are on our third president trying to do something  about that, the past two failed miserably.  This network continues to  thrive and they continue to kill Afghans and Afghan people and U.S.  soldiers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is the state of this network, of ISIS right now, for a  year and a half, we have been talking about ISIS being on the run.  But  recently, we're seeing issues of, in certain corners, where they are back,  and now you've got this Taliban-linked network as well.  Where are we, in  the state, in terms of against terrorism, right now?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, well, first of all, the Al-Qaeda network is thriving and ISIS  is thriving outside of Syria and Iraq, we did take their territory away  from them.  That was something that had to be done because that was a major  recruiting tool for them and also a place where they could direct actions  in other parts.  </p><p> There's 30 affiliates that are outside of Syria and Iraq, and there's one  that is a growing menace inside of Afghanistan.  The Al-Qaeda itself, still  -- their headquarters are still in north western Pakistan, and they have  other networks in Africa, a significant one in Syria that they're about to  conduct campaigns against.  </p><p> But the radical Islamist Global Jihad is out there and is doing well.   We've been at this for 17 years and the fact is, if we are totally honest  with ourselves, despite all of our efforts this -- there has been expansion  in their capabilities over these years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Let me -- let me zero in on Syria, because the President  has made it clear, this weekend, he will not tolerate an assault from  President Bashar al-Assad and his allies on rebel fighters in the Idlib  Province.  </p><p> Here's yesterday's tweet from the President and he says, President Bashar  al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province.  The Russians  and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in  this potential human tragedy.  Hundreds of thousands of people could be  killed.  Don't let that happen.  The President writes.</p><p> This comes after Iran's foreign minister said that terrorists must be  purged from the region.  What do you make of the President's strategy in  such a volatile region?</p><p> KEANE:  You know, what's happening here has set the -- set the framework  for everybody.  The Iranians and the Russians successfully propped up the  Assad regime.  And what they've been doing -- and that began with the  Russians in 2015.  And what they've been doing this last year or so, is  consolidating those gains.  </p><p> And this is one of the last opposition forces strongholds in Idlib  Province.  The problem is, there are about 3 million people and residents  there.  Now, these fighters are largely Al-Qaeda fighters and there's about  10,000 of them strong, and some other few thousands of other fighters there  as well.  </p><p> This is -- this is the most fiercest, toughest of the opposition forces  that the Assad regime will have to deal with and that's why they have put  this off as long as they have.  The Turks are also trying to deter this  from happening and they moved some forces down into northern Syria.</p><p> The President is using some rhetoric to do that.  But to be frank about it,  we have very little leverage, in Syria, to stop this.  They're in the  planning and preparation phase, I do believe they eventually will execute  this at some point.  We will know when the campaign begins because the  bombing will begin.  </p><p> And believe me, the Russians do most of the bombing in Syria, they've been  doing that for well over a year now.  And their way of war here is the same  way that Putin made war in Chechnya, in a place called Grozny, the inside  of Chechnya in 2000.  </p><p> And that is to go in there, where conventional bombs and eliminate as much  of the population as possible, thereby depriving the terrorists as they  call them, or insurgence from support from the people and obviously,  killing terrorists as well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> KEANE:  But the objective for the Russians will be as it is for Assad, to  go kill as many people as we possibly can, destroy their homes, destroy  their facilities, destroy their hospitals, destroy their warehouses, taking  much all of their quality of life away from them, and thus -- therefore,  dry up the terrorist support that they're getting from the people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Still, such an incredibly dangerous situation, General.  Let me  switch gears because this week, one of the big issues will likely be the  trade issues between China and the U.S., we actually could see the U.S.  impose that additional $200 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, this  Thursday, the 6th, and we are waiting on that.</p><p> What's your take on where we are with China and also the trade story around  Canada as the U.S. successfully does a deal with Mexico, and now awaits  China's -- Canada's participation, rather, so China and Canada, the  unknowns?</p><p> KEANE:  Yes.  Well, I think the major issue certainly is China.  Canada is  a major trading partner as well.  But I generally agree that taking on  these trade imbalances is the right thing to do and try to fix some of it  as much as possible.</p><p> We've obviously had some success with the European Union.  We'll have to  see the final result of that, at least that's been the goal, the goal to  zero tariffs that would be really something that we could do  internationally, unlikely to be sure.</p><p> But listen, China has been conducting economic warfare on the United States  and our allies for years and it's about time that somebody is calling them  on this, not just the trade imbalance but the incredible amount of  intellectual property theft, the incredible amount of cyber espionage  that's taking place.  </p><p> We are on a collision course with China, not just economically, but also in  terms of what their militarization of the Western Pacific, their  geopolitical goals, all at the expense of the -- of the United States.  The  president maintains public diplomacy, you know, President Xi is my friend,  we've got a great relationship.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KEANE:  And that's fine, but the team that's working beneath him, his  economic team, and also his national security team, very clear eyed about  China, they know that they are a major obstacle to the United States  interest around the world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Obstacles, but now, also an issue for the North Korea story, so  now we know for sure that the trade issues between the U.S. and China have  begun to impact the general discussion about denuclearization in North  Korea, China teaming up with North Korea, and the President basically  calling back Pompeo from even going to North Korea because of it.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, that occurs as a result of some original letter we received  from the North Korean official prior to the visit, and the President read  that attitude as much as he saw an attitude change just prior to the  Singapore Summit and he cancelled it.</p><p> He's using that cancellation of the visit as leverage.  We'll see if that  attitude changes.  We are just waiting for the North Koreans to do  something positive on denuclearization, which they have not done to date.   And I think that we'll give them a little bit more rope there.  </p><p> But the President and his team are running out of rope, frankly, and after  a number of weeks, they are going to have to start slapping sanctions,  harder sanctions on North Korea.  And here is the big one, because China  has opened up the aperture and has provided some sanction relief to North  Korea ever since the Singapore Summit.  </p><p> If they don't stop that, we'll going to have to sanction China as well,  we'll have to go after some of their banking systems.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow, all right, more will be revealed here.  General, it's good  to talk to you as always.  Thanks so much.</p><p> KEANE:  Yes, good talking to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  General Jack Keane, there.  Coming up, a Georgia police officer  is fighting for his life this morning, after being shot in the head while  responding to a shoplifting call at Wal-Mart, the very latest on his  condition, coming up.  </p><p> Then, liberal backlash, the New Yorker uninviting Steve Bannon from its  festival, after celebrities outcries, what Bannon is now saying, next, back  in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, a police officer is fighting for his life this  morning after he was shot in the head.  Cheryl Casone with the details,  Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Maria, 34-year-old officer Matt Cooper was responding to a call of  men shoplifting bandanas at a Walmart, near Atlanta.  He was shot while he  was chasing a suspect across the street.  The suspect then killed himself;  two others are in custody.  The six-year veteran on the force is in serious  condition this morning.  He's also an army veteran, a husband, and a father  of two.  </p><p> Well, Steve Bannon has been dropped from the annual New Yorker festival  after liberal outrage.  The former White House adviser was disinvited from  the event after several celebrities, including Jim Carry, Patton Oswalt,  and Judd Apatow said they would boycott the festival if Bannon showed up.   Well, Bannon responded in a statement, he called David Remnick, the Editor  of the New Yorker gutless.  </p><p> Well, \"Crazy Rich Asians\" continues to dominate theaters for third weekend  in a row.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We can't afford this.  So, your family is rich.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're comfortable.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  That is exactly what a super-rich person would say.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The movie brought in just over $22 million.  Its domestic gross  now totals over 110 million -- forget the global box office, it's bigger.   Also, for the third weekend in a row, \"The Meg\" made $10.5 million.  That  scary thriller is still doing well.  Third place, \"Mission Impossible:  Fallout\" with $7 million.  Rounding up the top five: \"Operation Finale\" and  \"Searching,\" each earned about 6 million.  Maria, back to \"Mission  Impossible: Fallout\" topped the international box office this weekend.   $77.3 million in China, global take at 649. Tom Cruise is 56-years-old,  maybe this bodes for the \"Top Gun\" sequel that's going to be coming out  soon.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  I got to see \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" that  is good.  </p><p> CASONE:  I know.  Me too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, no college diploma, apparently  no problem.  More big companies such as Google, Apple, they're ditching  college degree requirements for jobs.  We've got that story coming up right  after this short break.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  No diploma, no problem, apparently.  More and  more companies are scrapping degree requirements for jobs those degrees of  college.  Lauren Simonetti with all the details now, Lauren. </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hey, great to see you.  I know.  No B.A., no problem is what  the companies are saying.  They're not saying don't go get a college  degree, they're just saying if you don't have one, it's not going to be a  barrier for you to work in certain jobs at our company.  So, what are these  15 major companies that's saying no B.A. is totally fine?  Nordstrom, Bank  of America, (INAUDIBLE), Apple, Google, IBM, you might not expect to see  some of those names on that list, and they're doing this as we get the  August job report -- it comes down on Friday.  But we do have the numbers  from July.  The national unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, it is going down  and it is going down among those who do not have college degrees.  </p><p> If you look at those with high school diplomas, the unemployment rate in  July went down to four percent.  And if you look at those with less than a  high school diploma, it went from one year ago, seven percent to 5.1  percent now.  That's not terrible.  The big question is why is this  happening?  Is it that college is too expense with the average tuition and  fees for private school about $32,000 and we're graduating with a combined,  what, $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, or is it that -- and you might  know the answer to this, Brian -- the colleges aren't preparing and  training the students (INAUDIBLE) as workers, whether it's coding, or some  of the vocational skills, have we lowered our standards, what's the problem  right now?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're a college professor.  You can't be happy about this.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  No, actually I am happy about it.  Because, look, the fact is,  for many, many students they're going to college for four, five, six years.   If they're getting out, when they're getting out with a degree, they don't  have the skills that employers want and employers are just saying, if we're  going through that process and you're going to spend that kind of money?   Forget about it.  Come work for us.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, it's the school's problems.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  Yes.  I mean, in so many cases, these degree programs aren't  preparing them to add value in the workplace, they're not teaching how to  be good professionals, they are sitting in classrooms, they're hearing  ideological rants; walking with a distorted view of reality.  Come on, why  would a company want to hire somebody like that? </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, not only that, but they're taking on thousands and  thousands and thousands of dollars of debt --</p><p> BRENBERG:  Which makes it even worse.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- to get all of that.  And I think a lot of people on the  worker side are saying, do I need to go through all of this and take on all  of this debt to be prepared for the workplace?  But on the other side I  think, you know, you said there's a 3.9 percent unemployment rate.  That is  really the crux of the whole thing; the worker shortages in industries all  across the economy and companies are saying, well, you know, maybe we don't  need college graduates for this job or that job, maybe we need to broaden  our horizon.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good point.  Big worker shortage right now in truck drivers.   Amazon needs truck drivers.  Construction.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Home care aid.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Even financial advisers.  As people get older, as this  generation gets older, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've been an advocate for -- my brother and I, for years, have  had this conversation, if we could go back and do it again we would out of  high school try to go and work for a major corporation and get on the job  training.  Because ultimately, it keeps you -- people are literally  spending a quarter of a million dollars for an education and social  justice, and gender pronounce.  That's what they -- that's what the people  at these liberal arts colleges are worried about.  And if more of these  technology companies start educating people right out of high school, find  smart kids and basically make them sign a contract say, you know, we'll  teach you -- give you on the job training, you're going to work here for  five years and you can go up and do whatever you want.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Having said all of this -- Brian, I'm sure you can speak to  this, the research shows, unequivocally, that people with college degrees  fare much better in life.  Your lifetime earnings are much higher if you  have a college degree than if you --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a really important point.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- encouraging people to skip college altogether.  </p><p> BRENBERG:  That doesn't imply causation; it's the reason they're getting  these jobs because they went to college, would they get them anyway.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  All good questions.  Lauren, great to see you.   Thank you so much, Lauren Simonetti.  Still ahead, Nike takes side.  The  backlash after the company taps Colin Kaepernick for its \"Just Do It\"  campaign, next hour, right here in MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Thanks for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, August  1st.  Your top stories right now 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The race to $1 trillion is on, Apple reporting a big beat for the fiscal  third quarter.  The stock is on track to open at an all-time record high.   Take a look, close to $200 a share, we are breaking down the results.  When  will it hit $1 trillion in market value?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, renewed trade tensions to report, report this morning said if the  White House is looking to raise tariffs on China to 25 percent.  The  president also doubling down on his tough talk at a rally last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We've helped rebuild China,  we can't do that anymore.  We can't do that anymore and our farmers  understand it and our workers understand it, and frankly our companies  understand it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The escalating trade threat weighing on market this morning.   Take a look at Futures indicating a decline at the start of trading, about  39 points on the Dow Industrials, down three points on the S&amp;P.  NASDAQ  this morning is up by 12 points.</p><p>Investors also waiting on the Fed, the Fed decision, no change is expecting  for the Federal Reserve.  Today, they will be looking for signals about  future interest rate hikes and what the Fed says about the environment rest  of the year.  </p><p>This after gains across the board yesterday in Wall Street, take a look at  markets, Dow Industrials picked up 108 points yesterday, one half of one  percent.  S&amp;P500 was up 13, and the NASDAQ yesterday up 42 points, that was  one half of one percent.</p><p>Global market this morning look like this, as you can see, down across the  board.  FT-100 is down 78, that's better than one percent.  The CAC  Quarante is down just a fraction and the DAX Index is down a third of a  percent, that's 42 points lower this morning in Europe.  </p><p>In Asia overnight mixed performances, the worst performer was China.

We  have the very latest on this investigation coming up.</p><p>And tackling election interference, Facebook pulled dozens of accounts off  the site as the Senate Intelligence Committee gears up for a hearing this  morning.  The fallout coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break  it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Rosecliff CEO,  Managing Partner Mike Murphy.  And National Security Analyst, Morgan  Ortagus. Good morning.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  $203.45, that is the level  that Apple stock has to hit today for it to be $1 trillion company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's pretty incredible.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wow.</p><p>MURPHY:  Is it a one-day bet?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I bet Kevin Kelly that Apple would reach the $1 trillion market  capitalization before Amazon.  I could win that bet today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You could win that bet today.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Very well said.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Generally, I don't gamble.  I don't bet.  So if I offer to take  a bet, don't take that bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Great.</p><p>MURPHY:  Big focus on Apple this morning. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that?  Tell us.</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Would you buy the stock right here?</p><p>MURPHY:  I would.  You know, I would.  And let me tell you why, Apple's  trading roughly 15 times earnings and you look at all the other big tech  companies, they're trading at 70 times earnings, 30 times earnings.</p><p>So Apple is shifting away from a hardware maker or phone company into a  more technology services type company.  If you put a 30 multiple on Apple,  it's trading at about $400 a share.  So I think there's a lot of upside.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why is it trading only at 15 or 17 times when all the others  are trading at 70?  I don't get that.</p><p>MURPHY:  Because it's being priced as a hardware company, a company that  just makes a device which it has been.  So if you stop ordering a new  phone, theoretically the company would seize to exist so it wouldn't  continue to grow.  </p><p>So although phone sales were only up one percent, their services business  is up 31 percent.  You could argue it's very cheap at these levels.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's all about the services revenue, right?</p><p>MURPHY:  All about the services revenue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what everyone's talked about, people driving the stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's about that -- it's about that but it's also about your  average selling price is going up for the iPhones.  That is a critical  thing that we'll talk about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the commodities business, true. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  The average selling price was $724 a unit which was  above analyst expectations, analyst expectations didn't even expected to  hit $700 and it looks like the real large phone that's coming out in the  fall is going to help that price keep going up and up --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because it's expected to be priced at $1,099.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Holy moly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A plus size (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even more than the 10.  All right.  Hold that thought because  we have that coming up right after this.  </p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, retired U.S. army, Lieutenant  Colonel Allen West is with us this morning.  Harvard Law Professor Emeritus  Alan Dershowitz is with us this morning, along with Fox News Senior  Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Also the CEO of Hologic, Stephen McMillan back with us, they make the 3D  mammography machines.  Plus, Family Medicine Doctor Mikhail Varshavski AKA  Dr. Mike with us as well.</p><p>Big three hours ahead, don't miss moments of it.  And, of course, we hit  our top story right now which you've already heard a moment of, earnings  front and center for Apple.  Apple posted strong results last night.  </p><p>Earnings per share coming in at $2.34 a share on revenue of $53.27 billion.   The company sighting strong demand for iPhones as Apple's raising toward  that $1 trillion market capitalization.  It is another big day for  corporate earnings in fact.  We've got ADP, Humana, and Tesla all reporting  their quarterly numbers this morning while Apple shares are up three and a  half percent right now.</p><p>Analysts are expecting Tesla meanwhile to lose money, posting a loss of  $2.92 a share on revenue of $3.96 billion.  Joining us right now is ARK  Invest Analyst, Tasha Keeney.  Tasha, good to see you.  Thank you so much  for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, INVEST ANALYST, ARK:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the Apple quarter.  We heard Mike's analysis  here that it's actually trading at a discount to where competitors are.   Your thoughts on the stock and the earnings picture.  </p><p>KEENEY:  You know, I like this comparison of Apple and Tesla.  You know,  Apple used to be considered a fashion statement before the iPhone was  popular.  People thought, oh -- you know, people are just buying this for  the look.</p><p>But really, people are buying it because it was more convenient, it was a  better phone.  And I think Tesla is the same way.  You know, people right  now think it might be just a fashion statement, but actually it's a better  car, it's a better product.  It improves overnight in your garage.</p><p>So I think that, you know, people are really missing this long-term story  of this competitive advantage that's not going away.</p><p>MURPHY:  But when you look at Apple and Tesla, I think they're two very  different companies because Apple has enough cash to sustain itself for a  very long time, very strong balance sheet.</p><p>Whereas Tesla, you could argue that they need money although Elon Musk says  they don't but they need money and could be in a huge cash crunch in a very  short-term.  So I think the -- although both innovators, both leaders in  their industry but two very different stories when you look at the balance  sheet.</p><p>KEENEY:  I agree with you.  And I think -- you know, Elon Musk has said  that Tesla might not raise money or doesn't need to raise money, I think  Tesla could raise money.  And in fact, you know, as investors at ARK  Invest, we'd be happy with that.</p><p>We just want them to get as many cars in the road as possible because these  cars all act like many R&amp;D centers.  They gather data, they improve the  mapping system and they'll lead the way to autonomous driving.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  So Tasha, speaking of autonomous driving, Tesla certainly has the  capability but Volvo has a very autonomous vehicle and all of the major car  companies are coming out with automobiles that have some level of autonomy.  </p><p>What's the difference between like what Volvo is producing in the F90 and  how that's I think that's at least a level two or three on the autonomy  scale versus what Tesla's producing?  Why does Tesla has the advantage?</p><p>KEENEY:  So when a Volvo car comes off the lot, the technology that it has  is stagnant, it stays that way.  Tesla can actually improve the technology  of the car through over the air updates.  And it's the only automaker with  that capability.</p><p>Also the only automaker that's actually collecting data off of customer  cars to make those updates and to feed its (INAUDIBLE) to improve its  software system.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  That data from the car goes back to Tesla?</p><p>KEENEY:  Exactly.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  OK, interesting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But we have to look forward.  And Dagen, Apple CEO Tim  Cook warned on the conference call that tariffs are attacks on the  consumer.  So going forward, are we going to still see this kind of  outperformance when you've got tariffs possibly cutting into the margins?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's one of the only real serious hurdles in the short run for  China is -- for Apple is related to China and what is going on with the  White House, with the Trump Administration and China.</p><p>Front page of the Wall Street Journal today which you referenced in the  open is that this next step of $200 billion in goods that the U.S. is going  to slap tariffs on, originally it was forecast from the White House, it was  going to be 10 percent, now they're talking about 25 percent and that will  be consumer goods.</p><p>Apple makes its iPhones in China, it can't really easily shift production  to another nation to avoid that.  They're analyze -- Apple is analyzing the  impact of the trade fight between China and the United States.  But I will  add this, there has already been negative press floated in China about  Apple.</p><p>And, again, it's a communist government, it's centrally planned, there's  been one criticism that the iMessage service doesn't block spam enough on  CCTV, they jump in and said Apple's app store allows illegal gambling apps.   So, again, that's how China can hit these American companies.</p><p>They can hit them and China is still critical just sales there.  Nine --  one-fifth of sales are to China with a 19 percent increase in that nation  were Apple in the most recent quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does this -- does this not come into your model in terms of  looking where this company goes?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think if the tariffs become a thing and if -- then Tim Cook made  a statement that they will make a public announcement about it and how it  could impact the business.  So, yes, you have to factor that in when and if  it becomes a thing.</p><p>It's not affecting the business right now, the business is doing great.   It's hitting on all cylinders really.  So I think if you look at the other  side, if there are not tariffs, if the tariffs don't negatively impact  Apple, where is the stock price at that point?  And I think it's much  higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm surprised there aren't more phones that look at Apple but  aren't Apple in China by the way.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why aren't they copying Apple phones like they copy everything  else, they probably are.</p><p>MURPHY:  The local Chinese company Huawei, they are now number one in  China, they overtook Samsung so they are doing it.  But Apple is still a  status symbol and they've built this (INAUDIBLE) where once they're using  the Apple product you need the Apple music and you have the Apple cloud.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MURPHY:  So I think that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very sticky business.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, long run rate for Apple right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  China as a government understands the importance of  Apple because all the phones are made in China.  So they would be careful  about allowing runaway theft of the Apple brand when the -- within the  country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The -- you know, talking about two sort of innovative, really  21st century companies, you mentioned comparing it to Tesla.  The  leadership is very different, isn't that right?  I mean, does Elon Musk  need to change his leadership style as the company gets bigger?</p><p>KEENEY:  Yes.  You know, it's funny that you say that because if you --  Elon Musk is a character, he's out there.  And actually we saw with Steve  Jobs, he also was, you know, very aggressive on the competition.</p><p>He hopped on one of the earnings calls and went on to rant about android,  he said it was his -- you know, his personal vendetta.  So I think, you  know, Elon Musk is this -- is the star figure.  I mean, he's doing these  amazing things, he's launching rockets, he's re-landing them.</p><p>I think that's what makes Tesla employees willing to work for him and  willing to work so hard.  So we think that's a big part of Tesla's  competitive advantage, is his leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But a lot of employees have left.  Like their chief  engineering is gone.  And, again, there's a difference between being  inspirational and being a jerk.  And I think to the average person, Steve  Jobs was a huge inspiration to them.  And he was able to see what they  needed before they even knew it themselves.</p><p>And quite frankly, historically, Elon Musk has acted like a jerk and that's  been one of the problems with people in Silicon Valley, these leaders, they  think they are Steve Jobs before they've ever produced something that was  nearly as successful as even the iPod.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What was that conference call that he had a couple of  months ago when he was upset with the analyst?  Because they were asking  real questions like, why do you burn so much cash?  And will you be able to  keep burning cash like that without a money raise?</p><p>KEENEY:  You know, I'm glad that you brought up that point, on that analyst  -- on that earnings call, we were actually happy that he did that because  we're long-term investors.  And all of those questions were so short-term. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it doesn't bother you that they're burning the cash at this  rate?</p><p>KEENEY:  They're missing the force (INAUDIBLE).  You know, again, I think  they could do a raise and we just want them to get as many cars on the road  as possible and right now their competitive advantage is unrivaled.</p><p>They have better battery, technology than anyone out there.  And, again,  they're the only car that's actually updating after it leaves Tesla.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, good stuff.  Tasha, good to see you.  Thanks  so much.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tasha Keeney there.  Keep it right here for a special jobs in  America coverage of the July jobs report.  Also, its Friday morning, 8:00  a.m. Eastern.  We got a big jobs number coming out especially after that  4.1 percent GDP report last week.</p><p>Meanwhile, we'll take a short break.  When we come back, fighting election  interference, Facebook is pulling the plug on a coordinated effort to  influence November's midterm elections.  Who could be behind that campaign?   That's next.</p><p>And then a miraculous escape, more than 100 people on a plane in Mexico  making it out alive after their jetliner crashed and caught fire.  What  authorities are now saying about what caused that plane to go down.  Back  in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  New wildfires, more evacuations hitting  California.  Nearly 20,000 homes threatened right now.  Cheryl Casone with  the details.  Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CASONE:  Good morning Maria.  Firefighters now battling a new fire that's  erupted in Mendecino, California, that is north of San Francisco.  About 60  homes forced to evacuate more than 10,000 acres are now burning. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Carr Fire continues to rage.  The blaze which claimed the  lives of at least six people now considered the sixth most devastating fire  in state history.  Nearly 900 homes destroyed, entire neighborhoods have  been flattened.</p><p>Well U.S. workers are getting the biggest claim increase in nearly a  decade.  New report from the Labor Department says the cost of worker  compensation in a form of pay and benefits edged up to 2.8 percent, that's  the biggest yearly gain since mid-2008.   </p><p>The increase due to low unemployment with the jobless rate and an 18-year  low.  President Trump touted the numbers at a rally in Florida last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Since the election we have added 3.7 million new jobs they would  not have believed.  We're in the longest positive job growth streak in  history, think of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, we're going to see what the Federal Reserve thinks of that  when it announces its interest rate decision later today.  Of course, the  statement's going to be interesting.</p><p>Well, struggling MoviePass making some big changes to stay alive.  Last  week it said it ran out of money, so now it's going to make subscribers pay  50 percent more every month.  You're now going to have to pay $14.95 a  month for the standard pricing plan, previously it was a flat fee of $9.95  to see multiple movies.</p><p>The change taking effect sometime this month.  MoviePass has drawn the  attention of Elon Musk, a Twitter user asked Musk if he could fix  MoviePass.  Musk simply said no.  Maria, those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thank you so much.  Coming up, a coordinated  campaign, Facebook is pulling the plug on more plug on more than 30 pages  trying to use its platform to influence the midterm elections.  Who could  be behind the effort?  We'll have the story next.</p><p>And then a masterpiece, one pizza delivery boy wows his customers by  playing Beethoven after delivering their pepperoni pie.  His performance  goes viral this morning, we're going to take you there and get a closer  look.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Beijing in a bind, President Trump last night  talking tough on trade promising to rebuild the United States after years  of unfair trade practices, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We've taken the toughest ever actions in response to China's abuse  of trade practices. And we're doing very well with China, very well.  And I  have a lot of respect for China and I have tremendous respect for President  Xi of China.  But this has been too many years of abuse, $500 billion a  year, $500 billion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This comes as some of the administration advisors are urging  the president to impose a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of  Chinese goods.  A significant boost from the original 10 percent proposal  in a bid to pressure Beijing into a compromise.</p><p>China's top leaders now pledging to keep their economy intact aimed at what  they deemed new challenges as the president's tariffs start to bite.   Joining me right now is the CEO of Nestle USA, Steve Presley.  Steve, good  to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>STEVE PRESLEY, CEO, NESTLE USA:  Good morning Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Give us your status check as Nestle obviously a European  company, you're overseeing what has been an expansion in the U.S. but have  you felt the pressure of these escalating tariffs?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Yes.  Look, for us in Nestle, we believe open trade is the right  thing for consumers.  And so long-term that's what we believe.</p><p>And for us obviously the -- it's better for the consumers long-term f we  can find good trade balance between the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when the president was with the E.U. Commissioner Mr.  Juncker last week, they said that they were moving toward no tariffs, no  subsidies on both Europe and the U.S.  Give us a practical understanding of  what that means for Nestle and what that would mean in terms of what your  price is for your goods whether it's coffee or chocolate or anything else.</p><p>PRESLEY:  Well, it's -- good you ask that.  I think for us the reality is  in the U.S., the majority of our businesses manufactured in this country  for U.S. consumers every day.  We have over 50,000 employees in the -- in  the country and over 50 factories.  And so for us it has less impact to our  business in Nestle U.S. than it does for some of our other competitors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So if we were to see no tariffs then you would -- then you  would be exactly where you are today, is that right?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Materially, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even though there are tariffs right now in place on the  European side.</p><p>PRESLEY:  There are.  So I'm speaking specifically for the U.S. business  we'd be in the same place today.  The majority of our products, the vast  majority of our products are manufactured in the U.S. for U.S. consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Trump Administration is implementing a sweeping overhaul of  U.S. taxes, obviously he did that earlier this year with a positive impact  on large corporations, the tax bill, reduced the corporate tax rate from 35  percent all the way down to 21 percent.</p><p>Change the way government taxes companies that will operate internationally  as well like Nestle operating more than 400 factories across 85 countries.   Tell us about the impact on your business.  The administration is now  talking about its second tax package in terms of to build on the cuts.   What would be the impact?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Well we think tax reform was a good move by the administration.   Overall, it makes the U.S. a more attractive place to invest.  You  mentioned our recent expansion with our Starbucks deal and we continue to  look to invest in the U.S.  It's our largest market globally and tax reform  helps make this a more attractive market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Tell us about the Starbucks deal, when will that be  implement -- when does that get executed?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Yes, we're very excited about the Starbucks deal.  We expect to  close by the end of August on the deal and really for us it's about  building an incredibly strong coffee portfolio that we think is a  leverageable platform for years to come in coffee.</p><p>We're the leader in North America now and the largest coffee market.  It's  aligned with our global pillar which is coffee and we're really excited  about bringing just a brand that is meant coffee in the U.S. and pair it  with our other really strong brands on coffee in the U.S. between an  Nespresso, Nescafe, some other businesses we brought to the portfolio in  Chameleon and Blue Bottle.  So we think collectively we've just got a great  portfolio of coffee to go and win in that market.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well tell us about business right now, what would you say the  demand picture looks like in the U.S. today?</p><p>PRESLEY:  I'd say the demand picture is good.  The improving health of the  consumer and the economy is good for our industry, right?  So food and  beverage their categories are up for the first time in a while.</p><p>We've seen relatively flat to stable categories for the last few years and  as the consumers get healthier and job numbers get better, then the food  and beverage category gets better.  So overall, the outlook's pretty  bright.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting raise prices?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Yes, great question.  I think for us, the first thing we focus on  is making sure we really look to removing whatever inefficiencies we've had  in the business and try not to make sure we pass any of those on the  consumers.</p><p>We're so consumer focused at delivering great value for our products for  them every day, like that's our first step.  The reality is the industry  hasn't had inflation for the last five years.  It's been relatively stable.   And so I think some form of pricing will return to the market, I do think  it's good for us, it's good for our customers.  And the healthy economy and  a healthy consumer helps make that possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And is it fair to say that if you were to see higher  retaliatory tariffs, once you sellout to Europe, I know it's produced in  the U.S. and it's largely for us consumption.  But if you were to see  tariffs, does that push you even further to raise prices?  Would you be  forced to raise prices should you have the tariffs to deal with?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Yes, I go back to -- we believe that open trade is the right  answer in a period.  And so I think that's the best long-term hope that we  can get t open trade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about jobs, bringing jobs back to America.  Yesterday  you celebrated the grand opening of your new U.S. headquarters in Virginia.   Pretty significant milestone in the 152-year history of the company.</p><p>But even as established Nestle is, you've continued to adapt to future  demands through innovation.  Tell us about the new plan.</p><p>PRESLEY:  Yes, absolutely.  I think more than just announcing an opening of  new headquarters here in Virginia.  It's about, you know, relocations are  great catalyst that we can inject into the business to transform it in a --  in a huge way and it's been a great lever for us moving across country,  resetting the expectation, resetting the culture and driving this culture  of innovation in the market.</p><p>And we're really excited about the opportunity, we've had a great  partnership with the State of Virginia and the local development here and  we're looking forward to what being on the East Coast will bring for us.</p><p>The reality is for us 80 percent of the consumers, 80 percent of our  customers are on this part of the country.  So it brings us closer to our  consumers and our customers which I think makes us better for the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are there new jobs that you will be bringing here as a  result of this new plant?</p><p>PRESLEY:  Absolutely.  We continue to grow in the U.S. and so in -- we'll  have almost 2,000 employees in the State of Virginia between our corporate  headquarters and our two factories.  And so there'll be new jobs absolutely  as we continue to look to grow our business in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Steve2, we'll be watching.   Thanks so much. </p><p>PRESLEY:  Thank you so much Maria, appreciate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Presley, the CEO of Nestle.  Coming up, heading home at  last.

We'll tell you which chain is rolling  out the tiny patio set, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us this morning, happy Wednesday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it  is Wednesday, August 1st, your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East  Coast.</p><p>The U.S. still locked in trade negotiations with China, but a new report  suggests that the Trump administration is ready to impose steeper tariffs  on good (INAUDIBLE) President Trump reaffirms his position on the trade  situation at a rally last night in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country,  this is the time to straighten out the worst trade deals ever made by any  country on earth, they are the worst.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Futures indicating a mixed showing at the start of  trading this morning, Dow Industrials down about 20 points right now, the  NASDAQ is up 20 points.  This after the market closed higher yesterday  after strong earnings from industrials, with the Dow Jones Industrial  Average up 108 points, yesterday, almost one-half of one percent.</p><p>S&amp;P was also up one-half a percent, as was the NASDAQ with the 42-point  move yesterday.

That would be Beethoven and you'll have to hear it to believe it.   We're going to bring you that, coming up.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning, but first, our top  story this half an hour at 6:33 on the East Coast, this social media  election interference continues, Facebook, this morning, claiming they've  suspended 32 accounts that have engaged in what they are calling  coordinated unauthentic behavior, which served to stokes political tensions  ahead of the 2018 midterms.  </p><p>The company's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, explains it here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO OF FACEBOOK:  This kind of behavior is not allowed on  Facebook because we don't want organizations or individuals creating  networks of account that mislead people about who they are or what they are  doing.  </p><p>Everyone who works in securities knows security in arms race.  We're glad  that we were able to find this.  We always know that, you know, our  adversaries are going to get better and we're going to have to get better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel  and Former Florida Congressman, Allen West.  Good to see you, Colonel,  thanks so much for being here.</p><p>LT. COL. ALLEN WEST (RET.) FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be -- good to be  with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you make of this?  Is this propaganda at play?  What's  going on in terms of Facebook shutting down these accounts with more  evidence, they say, of tampering?</p><p>WEST:  Well, we know that the Russian internet research activity is still  continuing on with their shenanigans.  I think, it's very pavlovian when  you don't admit or don't understand that there's bad behavior out there,  and you allowed to continue to permeate.</p><p>We've got to shut down.  We have to be very serious about our cybersecurity  and, I think, one of the key things that the United States of America has  to do, we have to get offensive-minded when we look at these intrusions  into our cyber world being that through the internet and being how it can  affect our political systems.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is there any way to stop it?</p><p>WEST:  Oh, yes.  Of course, there's a way to stop it.  I think we need to  be able track these individuals back to their home nations and put the  right type of pressure on those countries.  We know that a lot of this is  tied back to Russia and also to North Korea.</p><p>And so, there are many different ways, there are many different tools that  the Trump administration can use.  But I think when you have the Department  of Homeland Security Director, Kirstjen Nielsen, out there recently in New  York, and they were talking about cybersecurity and the threats that it is  to our homeland.  We need to go, like I say, offensive in nature, now.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good morning, Colonel West.  This is Morgan Ortagus.  Speaking of  what --</p><p>WEST:  Good morning.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Kirstjen Nielsen said yesterday, Vice President Pence actually  made some very pointed remarks about cyber and said under the Obama  administration that there were so many attacks that went unchecked, and he  actually seemed to imply, yesterday, that the U.S. would go more offensive  on cyber, said that they going to hold countries accountable.  </p><p>What do you think that looks like in reality?  What is -- what is Vice  President Pence trying to say that the U.S. is actually going to do?</p><p>WEST:  Well, I think, now that we have the United States cyber commands  stood up and you have it in air force and the army respective at the sub  levels.  You know, we need to be able to go at these countries.  </p><p>We need to be able to go at these sources, because if we don't, we continue  to allow them to get better.  One of the things that we are starting to see  is their tactics, techniques and procedures are improving, so it's getting  harder to be able to detect them.  </p><p>So that's why we have to be offensive and not defensive, we have to not be  reactionary because that's what we have been in the past.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Colonel West, it's Dagen McDowell.  However, what about the  United States is doing that we don't see?  That we don't talk about?   Again, because the narrative really pushed by the left, quite frankly, is  that we are back on our heels and we are being manipulated by Russia and  it's all President Trump's fault.</p><p>However, it's what the intelligence community and even law enforcement is  doing behind the scenes, I think about the Stuxnet virus that was planted  years ago, in one of the nuclear facilities in Iran.</p><p>WEST:  Well, without a doubt, you are going to see the political critics of  President Trump try to leverage this against him and tie it back to their  press conference with Vladimir Putin.  But you're right, there are things  that are going on that we don't know about.  And as I said, that's why we  have the cyber command that had stood up, so we do have a military  organization that recognizes that this is a new part of the battlefield  that we are on.</p><p>MURPHY:  Colonel, this is Mike Murphy, how much of this comes back --</p><p>WEST:  Good morning, Mike.</p><p>MURPHY:  Good morning.  How much comes back to the American people?  How  much comes back to where -- when you're on Facebook, you're on social  media, you should have some understanding of what you're reading and don't  get caught up in this type of propaganda coming from overseas?</p><p>WEST:  Oh, Mike, I mean, you just hit the nail on the head.  We have to be  more circumspect ourselves, we have to be more responsible individuals and  that's one of the things that the other side is praying on.  </p><p>You know, back when I was a young cadet going through training, the general  sergeant used to call us stuck on stupid, every now and then.  And we need  to have people to stop being stuck on stupid out there and realize that  they are being manipulated.  </p><p>So there is an individual responsibility, we can't just sit around and say  the government has to come in and fix everything for us.  God gave each and  every one of us a brain and we need to use it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, it's certainly is a new era out there with regards  to privacy and people -- younger people not caring what's out there.  Let  me switch gears and ask you about North Korea this morning.  </p><p>A ceremony on the Korean Peninsula, dozens of Korean War veteran remains  prepare to make the journey home to Hawaii.  Vice President Mike Pence will  greet them in Hawaii.  Here's what he told me about that, when I  interviewed him on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  President Trump has asked  me to do many things on his behalf.  As Vice President, frankly, I've never  been more humbled and more honored to be asked to represent him as the  remains of American heroes from the Korean War, arrive back on American  soil.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, the vice president, of course, is very emotional about  this.  His father who fought in the Korean War, got the bronze star, Edward  J. Pence, your thoughts on this ceremony this morning and what this means?</p><p>WEST:  Well, it's an incredible thing.  You know, I served in the army for  22 years, and I spent one year on the DMZ in 1995 in South Korea, with the  Second Infantry Division.  And this is an incredible closing of a chapter  for so many American families.  Hopefully, we get these remains identified,  it gives them that closure.</p><p>And as a service member, RPOWs, and MIAs, we must continue to fight for  them, for their recognition, but we also must stay vigilant with North  Korea.  This is a great gesture that Kim Jong-un has made, but we also know  that based upon satellite imagery, they are still up to the same chicanery  with their nuclear missile development and testing with those ICBMs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, we don't -- there was one dog tag in the 55  remains, you think we will be able to identify these remains?</p><p>WEST:  Well, I tell you, based upon the new technology we have with DNA  identification, we will be able to do, I think, better than we could have  years prior, but, again, we want to make sure that this is not a hoax  because we are acting on good faith that these are remains of Americans,  coming back home, and you have so many family members that are hanging on  the -- on the edge to get some good news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so what is it going to be for you in terms of getting an  understanding of where North Korea is at, in terms of whether or not they  are telling the truth or if they really are just, you know, going along  about this whole, yes, denuclearization but it really won't be done, I  mean, what's your take on how serious they really are here?</p><p>WEST:  Well, without a doubt, I think North Korea is trying to draw this  thing out.  North Korea understands the political situation here in the  United States of America.  And they are probably hoping that President  Trump is not successful in the midterm elections, and everything shifts  away from them, which I don't think will happen.</p><p>So, I believe that we need to have a very strict and very tight timeline.   We need to get people on the ground there, in North Korea, to verify what  is happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I wonder if we are going to be able to verify, though,  what do you think?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think we are already making positive steps in that direction, I  mean, the fact that they -- whether this is symbolic or not, I mean, it  matters to a lot of people.  So, I think, where we were with them a year  ago, five years ago, 10 years ago, we're making progress.  So, you'd like  to think that it's going to continue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Keep the hammer down on the sanctions, though, President Trump  reiterated that we are doing that with Russia, and if they don't step up,  more sanctions quite frankly, and to make sure that China isn't allowing  cheating, which it seemed like that China, right after that summit, earlier  this year, that China was even allowing cheating that soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And as China, basically, pulling the strings here, Allen, in  terms of using that as leverage for the trade spat?</p><p>WEST:  Well, that's the thing that we have to play chess and not checkers,  we have got to put the pressure on China, because if you put the pressure  on China, you isolate North Korea, and you force the hand of Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>So that's why I'm glad to see that the President is laser-focus on China,  their theft of our intellectual property, their forced transfer of our  technology, all the things that they have done in rebuilding their  military.  We see what they are doing in the South China Sea, that's really  where we have to be focused on, is China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will watch that.  Allen West, good to see you  sir, thank you so much.</p><p>WEST:  Always a pleasure.  Thank you so much, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Colonel.  Coming up, a master piece, one pizza  delivery boy wows his customers with a performance of Beethoven, the video  going viral this morning, we've got it for you coming up next.  </p><p>And then where's the beef?  We will tell you about the trendy new diet that  claims you can lose weight by only eating beef, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A remarkable survival story in Mexico, Cheryl  Casone with the details now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Maria, good morning.  Bad weather causing a passenger jet with  over 100 people on board to crash just moments after takeoff.  This  happened in Durango, Mexico.  The Aeromexico flight going down in a field  just beyond the runway.  The jet burst into flames; all you see is the  plane's tail and huge trail of smoke.  Emergency crews rush to go get  survivors to the hospital.  Miraculously nobody was killed; there were some  very serious injuries, though, and there are reports that after takeoff the  plane was hit by a severe gust of wind that pushed it back down into the  ground.  </p><p>Well, get ready to pay more.  Prices for some major Proctor &amp; Gamble brands  are heading higher.  P&amp;G raising prices on familiar products such as  Bounty, paper towels; and Pampers, diapers by as much as five percent later  this year -- maybe early next year.  This follows lackluster sales growth  in P&amp;G's last quarter and it's not related, we should say, to tariffs or  trade issues.  Shares of Proctor &amp; Gamble down nearly13 percent so far this  year.  </p><p>OK.  One Canadian pizza chain is serving up its slices with some miniature  patio furniture.  Take a look at this.  Boston Pizza, which -- they are  actually from Canada -- is placing three mini-plastic chairs alongside  those small little stands that protect the pizza from box collapsing on it.   Boston Pizza thought the idea was a great way to celebrate patio season for  Canadians.  </p><p>Then there is this, a young man delivering more than just a pizza asked if  he could play a song on his customer's baby grand, listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Wow!  This is 18-year-old, Bryce Dudal.  He was playing the third  movement of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata from Memory.  And get this, from  Memory, he said he's mostly self-taught, he's been -- well, teaching  himself since he was 6-years-old.  He's a soon to be freshman in college.   He's going to school on baseball scholarship, Maria.  I think there might  be another scholarship available to him -- just guessing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wow!  It was great.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  He said, he's been playing baseball and kind of got away  from music but now he's rethinking it after this video went so viral.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, he delivers a pizza to somebody and he notices that they  have a baby grand piano and says can I play a tune?  </p><p>CASONE:  He does because it was a big beautiful baby grand.  At home, he  has just a small kind of, you know, rough piano.  You know, not as nice and  so he really wanted to play. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He did a great job.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Very gifted kid and great athlete and he's working for the summer  to make money.  Got to love him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's working for tips, come on.  That's what is all about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good for him.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hope he got a good tip for that Beethoven.  </p><p>MURPHY:  For sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Playing.  Thanks, Cheryl.  Coming up, steak lovers, rejoice!   We will tell you about the trending new diet that claims you can lose  weight by just eating meat.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Got beef, the carnivore diet claims you can lose  weight by eating meat like steak and burgers only.  Joining us now is Dr.  Mikhail Varshavski, also known as Dr. Mike.  Dr. Mike, good to see you.</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, CELEBRITY DOCTOR:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Carnivore diet?  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well, look, you can lose weight by just eating paper, Maria.   I mean, these things are just becoming insane.  We've known through  centuries of research and common sense that eating a diet that's plant- based, that's rich in vegetables is the right way to go.  This diet  completely excludes fruits and vegetables and says you should only eat meat  to lose weight.  That is incredible.  It doesn't make sense.  And I'll  explain to you why this is happening.  Social media algorithms -- because  the things are most extreme get the front-page popularity on YouTube, on  Instagram, on Facebook, this is what pops up to people.  Because it's so  much more interesting to click on a headline that says eat only meat, eat  only beef to lose weight, than it is to say, oh, eat a plant-based diet,  rich in these -- so, people click on it and gains popularity and traction,  and then you have all of these experts KIA experts, who claim to know all.   When, really, all they're doing is they're pushing unsubstantiated theories  and doing experiments on themselves.  So, there's no proof that this works.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the -- you're looking something like at (INAUDIBLE), and  you know, which was all the craze.  The idea is, what, you're burning fat.   Mike. </p><p>MURPHY:  The idea is you take in a lot of fat and therefore your body burns  fat.  And like, Dr. Mike is saying, it's a lot of better to someone sees  drinks a green juice or have porter house.  You know, they're going to say,  hey, I have to lose weight and have porter house.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The mind goes with whatever is more attractive.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But I mean, ultimately, like, a little common sense is needed.   Like, you need to have a balanced diet and need to be focused on plants.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How about just eat fewer calories and get up your butt and  exercise?  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  In theory, that's how these meats guys work, because meat is  so (INAUDIBLE) people eat less calories.  But that's not the good way to go  about this because if you look at processed meats, for example, there are  level one carcinogen on the WHO list of cancer-causing substances.  Because  it's been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, just like tobacco and cigarette  that they do cause cancer.  No, processed meats.  So, processed meats need  to be, as much as possible eliminated from your diet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, when people tweet me about this, I haven't eaten meat about  eight years, I've been a vegan for about two of that.  I always think  awesome: Do that as long as you kill and clean all the meat that you're  eating.  You know, like old-school southern grandma goes in the backyard to  kills the chicken and cleans it.  OK, if you're going to eat like that,  then, thumbs up for me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  The new study from researchers at Harvard, Yale, and  Colombia found that Americans are losing money by not chopping around for  medical procedures.  Study show that 40 percent of medical procedures have  reduced prices.  This is important and this is actually impacting a lot of  people.  Is there any validity to this?  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  There's a lot of validity to this.  Pricing transparency in  the healthcare field is horrible.  I don't know what procedures cost as a  doctor, my patients don't know what procedures cost, I would say 60 percent  of the time these are emergency procedures and they don't have an option to  shop around.  But 40 percent of the time, they do have the option to shop  around and prices have gone up so substantially that they've outpaced  earnings and income for my patients, so people are going into debt because  there's no pricing transparency.  In order for market forces to lower  costs, you need to have transparency.  </p><p>You look at the cosmetic industry where prices are known to people because  insurance companies aren't involved, you can make better decision, because  you could face surgeon A, charges this; and surgeon B, charges; and you can  go to this surgeon that charges less.  But when doctors are charging  directly or hospitals are charging directly to insurance companies, you  never know what prices are being charged -- facility fees, pharmacy benefit  -- it's a mess and transparency -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You as a doctor don't know if an MRI is going to be cheaper at  one place than another place?  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Absolutely. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't even go get an MRI.  You can't walk into an imaging  institution and say, what do you charge for MRI.  I need MRI; I'll pay for  it out of pocket?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You to get prescription.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Technology is coming and it's going help this.  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Technology is coming.  The things that I recommend to patients  is really three things: Number one, use some of these apps that are  available for pricing transparency, always argue your bills with hospitals  and insurance companies, and the third is focus on prevention and don't get  sick.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Great advice, Dr. Mike, great to see you.  </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Still ahead, crossing the swamp, George  Washington-style.

The Dow  Industrials down 50 points right now, a quarter of a percent lower; S&amp;P 500  is flat, down just 3 points; but the Nasdaq is up this morning, up about  11.25 points.

And joining me to  break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the CEO of  Rosecliff and managing partner Mike Murphy; and national security analyst  Morgan Ortagus.  Good morning.  Great to see you.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Good morning.  The shots of  Vice President Pence getting the remains are just really moving I think for  all Americans, but especially those of us who have served and had, you  know, had our friends and colleagues pass away overseas.</p><p>It's really beautiful I think that if you died last week or a month ago in  Iraq or Afghanistan or you died decades ago, how much America values our  service members' lives.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  And it's real emotional for Vice President Pence  as his father served in the Korean War and actually got the Bronze Star.  </p><p>Lots of stuff happening.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Yes.  Making progress,  for sure.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  And I believe his son is in the Marines as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It helps refocus our attention on what was a brutal conflict, a  brutal war.  And those people who have been forgotten.  It's one war that  we fought so valiantly that people sadly don't remember it as well as  others.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  You're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're also watching Apple this morning.  Looks like you're  going to win that bet with Kevin Kelly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So here's the price we're watching for -- $203.45 a share.  When  Apple breaks through that mark it will be the first $1 trillion market cap  U.S. company, so I'm watching for that.  But it was an incredible quarter.</p><p>And I think that we were talking about the iPhone sales, so it's about how  much Apple can still charge for an iPhone.  And the average selling price  for one of its phones was $724 a phone which was above analyst  expectations.  So those numbers they've got to keep going up in order to  really help drive this business and then services.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the services revenue.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Services -- and I think you're going to see as Wall Street  analysts get up and start going through these numbers, I think you're going  to see upgrades.  I think you're going to see recommendations to put new  money to work in Apple, gets it to $203 for Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And overall earnings are up almost 24 percent.  We have about 63  percent of companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported -- really incredible  quarter, much better than analysts were anticipating as we started this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, earnings very solid.  And you've got to look at the tax  cut plan and the rolling back of regulations that has really empowered S&amp;P  500 in terms of their earnings.</p><p>But one thing that you said earlier which was really interesting is the way  Apple trades because even though the earnings are up strong, double-digit  earnings growth, the stock is trading at what?  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's trading 15 times earnings.  So it's trading like a value  stock -- not a high growth company that it is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The broader markets 17?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes -- 17.  But then if you look at the tech companies -- the  Amazon and the Googles of the world -- they're trading at a much higher --  or Netflix, much higher multiples.  So if Apple traded even remotely like  one of those high growth tech companies, which it should -- it's a higher  stock.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think Netflix is trading at like more than a hundred  times cash flow.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Or something just like that.</p><p>All right.  We've got all of that coming up but first, we want to talk  about a trade standoff with China which continues.  Some White House  advisors are proposing that the President apply tariffs as high as 25  percent on $200 billion of imported Chinese goods, according to the \"Wall  Street Journal\".  That would be an increase from the original proposal  which was a 10 percent tariff.</p><p>The President weighed in on the economic relationship between the U.S. and  China last night during a rally in Florida.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We've taken the toughest ever actions in response to China's  abusive trade practices.  And we're doing very well with China, very well.   And I have a lot of respect for China and I have tremendous respect for  President Xi of China.</p><p>But this has been too many years of abuse -- $500 billion a year, $500  billion.  We've helped rebuild China.  We can't do that anymore.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the author of \"The Coming Collapse of  China\", Gordon Chang.  Gordon -- good to see you.  Thanks very much for  joining us.</p><p>We knew this wasn't going to go away any time soon.  But your thoughts on  the potential of an even escalating issue where he goes to 25 percent from  10 percent on Chinese goods.  </p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR:  I think the President's got to do that, as  regrettable as it is.  You know, the President gave relief to ZTE, the  embattled Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer.  That was undeserved.   But that really was an olive branch to the Chinese.  What do they do?   Well, a week ago today they did not give approval to Qualcomm's take over  of NXP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CHANG:  And remember the regulators, the state administration of market  regulation in China actually approved this deal.  Xi Jinping, the Chinese  ruler says no, I'm not going to do it which means you really can't  negotiate with the Chinese at this particular time.  Xi Jinping is in  trouble at home and this means that you just got to pile on the pressure.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.  And speaking of him being in trouble at home, \"The New York  Times\" had a story out yesterday just about this, about him facing  criticism at home for the economic state of China and the amount of  control.  \"The Financial Times\" over the weekend had a piece talking about  how the Chinese actually view the President as a master strategist -- very  different from how he's viewed here.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  What do you take on what we're seeing being reported out of Asia,  about Xi Jinping having quite a bit of criticism at home over the economy?  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  This is -- there are a lot of symptoms of Xi Jinping's  problems at home.  And it's not being reported in the \"People's Daily\" as  much as you would expect.  You have a lot of criticism now in the open.   This was unprecedented.</p><p>And so I think that essentially what we're seeing -- we don't know exactly  what's going on because it is an extremely opaque system.  But the point is  that Xi Jinping is in stress.  And that -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  But the criticism is unprecedented?  </p><p>CHANG:  The criticism is more than we've ever seen of Xi Jinping.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Wow.</p><p>CHANG:  And it's sort of natural because remember, he took control of the  economy.  As the general secretary of the Communist Party, he didn't have  the economics portfolio.  He took it over from the premier.  Now things are  going badly.  And so of course, he owns it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to add one thing.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  editorial page today writes about this very thing.  Be careful claiming  victory in this trade fight over China with the Chinese economy is slowing.   Chinese stocks have lost about a fifth of their value since January.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the yuan -- don't forget about the yuan.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this is because of China's policies.  They were trying to  deleverage that started two years ago because of the rapid buildup in  corporate debt and they're reopening the monetary spigots in China.</p><p>So again, this is a narrative that's starting to develop here at home that  the U.S. is winning.  The U.S. is slowing China's economy.  It's worth  noting that nobody wins a trade war.  You just get hurt a little bit less.</p><p>And China, the reason they're in this pickle, is because of their own  doing.  And now they're reversing it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What I worry about is, are tariffs really the answer?  Are  tariffs really going to get the Chinese to change their behavior?  I mean  the big problem here is the constant theft of intellectual property and the  forced transfer of technology that China continues to engage in.  They  don't even admit that they're engaging in it and they are.</p><p>Just because they're going to be paying a 25 percent tariff on $200 billion  goods, does that really change a culture of theft?  </p><p>CHANG:  No, it doesn't because this is embedded in the Chinese system -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CHANG:  -- and it's also embedded in Xi Jinping who actually believes that  there should be more state control of the economy, that China should close  up its markets and demand access to the American and other markets.  So,  you know, tariffs are not the only answer.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what is?  Then we will stop it.  </p><p>CHANG:  Well, I think that you know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is there any way to stop it?  </p><p>CHANG:  Now.  We're in an all-out fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CHANG:  And this means, you know, implications that no one really wants to  think about but clearly, you know, Xi Jinping is not letting this go which  means that we're going to have to probably go beyond tariffs.  We're going  to maybe even have to have import bans, you know -- all sorts of things  that now are inconceivable.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  The CFIUS bill.  </p><p>CHANG:  And CFIUS.  It is going to be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well yes -- CFIUS is getting strong but there are a lot of  things that CFIUS can't do even though they're making CFIUS stronger.</p><p>MURPHY:  So Gordon -- if the Chinese government -- if the tariffs bring  them to the table to just have a fair trade deal with the U.S. isn't that  the very important -- a vital step one to having -- as Maria pointed out --  a step?</p><p>So if we don't get them to the table for a fair trade deal, we're never  going to be able to talk to them about stopping theft.  So I think what  we're doing right now, what the President is doing right now is a vital  first step to solving this.  </p><p>CHANG:  Absolutely.  I mean because everything else doesn't work.  You  know, people say well, let's go to the WTO -- World Trade Organization.   We've won every case against China since 2004 and China's behavior has just  gotten worse.  And before 2004 we were winning most of the cases anyway.</p><p>You know, also, you know when Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary says  let's go talk to them -- well, that just does not work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANG:  So clearly -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a -- they don't believe in patents.  There's a  mentality that they just -- everything is open, you know, just take it.   You know, I like that idea, I'm going to take it.</p><p>CHANG:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's just crazy, actually.  There's an op-ed this morning in  the \"New York Times\" from Stephen Moore, Art Laffer and Steve Forbes.   They're calling on President Trump to end the tariffs by taking a page from  President Reagan's strategy for nuclear disarmament.</p><p>The article reads this in part, \"Just as no one ever thought Mr. Reagan  would stem nuclear proliferation, if Mr. Trump aggressively pursues this  policy, he could build a legacy as the President who expanded world  commerce and economic freedom by ending trade barriers rather than erecting  them.\"</p><p>This is what the President is trying to do.  He walked away from the E.U.  the other, saying yes, we're moving towards no tariffs, no subsidies.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.  Last Wednesday was a landmark, you know, because before that,  everyone was saying you know, Trump is bringing down the global trading  system.  Well, no, he's not.  What' he's doing is he's actually reducing  tariff barriers because if that deal with the E.U. actually gets  implemented, and it probably will, there's not going to be any tariffs on  non-automotive products.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But if he believes that then he should stop bragging about how  awesome the steel industry is in this country because of the tariffs that  he's put on steel and aluminum.  Again it's a handout to that union.  That  steelworkers union has been pushing the Democrats for this kind of deal for  years and he brags about the steel industry.</p><p>Well, the steel industry employs about 140,000 to 170,000 people.  Steel  consuming industries that are getting hurt that are raising prices, that  are seeing disruption and chaos in their businesses -- they employ 6.5  million people.  So again you're saving the few and rescuing the few and  sacrificing the many.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And even the whole idea of no tariffs, I mean -- is the E.U.  going to give up $150 billion?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They already pushed back.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They might have to, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They already -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I'm saying.  Are all these countries going to say  ok, no tariffs, forget it, even though we've been making $100 billion on  the U.S. for years.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But if it opens up trade to them it could actually be beneficial  and they may not have a choice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Yes.  Good point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They already pushed back on agricultural products.  They said  we're not talking about agricultural products.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they're not talking about autos.  </p><p>CHANG:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CHANG:  The important point is 4.1 percent growth in Q2, you know, China is  growing in reality less than half that.  Everyone needs the U.S. market.   And so that's the reason why you're absolutely right, we are going to have  a much lower tariff environment because people need to sell to America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's his stick -- very strong economy, $19 trillion economy  and they want this market.</p><p>Gordon -- good to see you.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  </p><p>Stay with us for our \"Jobs in America\" coverage this Friday, 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  We've got more economic news.  The jobs numbers will be out and  we will identify where the jobs are.</p><p>First though plans for printing 3D guns put on hold -- the latest legal  battle after a judge temporarily halts the release of blueprints for the  firearms, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>A sheriff's deputy in Missouri rushed to a hospital after being attacked by  a dog.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>Take a look at this.  The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department in Missouri  released this photo showing a deputy's blood-soaked uniform.  The pit bull  bit the deputy in the face and arm when the deputy approached a side door  of a home while serving a civil summons.</p><p>The deputy was able to reach his weapons and he shot the dog.  He was then  rushed to the hospital where he had to go -- he underwent surgery to repair  injuries in particular to his face and especially his lip.  The pit bull  survived its wound.  It's up to animal control now what happens next.</p><p>Meanwhile in Massachusetts, a small town is losing its entire police force  of four members.  The Blandford police department have quit.  They're  blaming unsafe working conditions.  Among their complaints -- ill-fitting  bulletproof vests that are outdated, they need to be replaced;  malfunctioning radios; and occasionally they have to drive their own cars  if they want to respond to calls and forget backup.</p><p>Well there's a new food recall to tell you about.  Federal health officials  warning consumers not to buy more than two dozen salads and wraps that are  distributed to Kroger, Walgreen's and Trade Joe stores.  The food might be  contaminated with a parasite.  The products have sell by dates from July  18th to July 23rd.  Shares of Walgreens' parent company are actually down 4  percent this year.  That's Boots Alliance.</p><p>And then speaking of Kroger, a subsidiary of the company in California will  no longer accept Visa credit and debit cards at its 21 grocery stores.   Kroger and Visa are in a dispute over swipe fees right now.</p><p>And then one more note on Kroger.  They're launching a grocery delivery  service as a bid to take on Amazon and Wal-Mart.  Take a look at Kroger  shares, that stock is actually up 8 percent so far this year.  We'll see  how the delivery service goes.</p><p>And then finally there is this, if you like sugar, take a look at this --  the world's largest gummy pizza.  This is all made of gummy bears.  Foodies  at Vat 19 came up with this.  It's a gummy pizza.  It weighs 225 pounds.   And then for the flavor, they've got orange gummies for the crust,  strawberry and banana is the cheese.</p><p>And then they're actually selling the slices for $150 each -- huge slices  for $150 each.  I mean that's a lot of sugar.  I have a sweet tooth, Maria,  but I don't know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not pizza.  That's not even pizza.  It's sugar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wish we had the camera on your face when you saw that dude  take a bite of the gummy pizza for the first time.  It was hilarious.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I'm with you -- Maria.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want tomato sauce, you want the cheese, mozzarella -- I  mean, come on.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  You're offending this Italian-American woman here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gummy pizza -- not.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  That's why you watch this program, because you just  heard Maria Bartiromo say mozzarella.  There's just nothing better -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mozzarella.  Ok.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, a major shakeup at Southwest, how the company is changing a  long-standing policy in the skies.  You'll want to hear this.</p><p>Then turning a campaign slogan into art -- check this out -- how one  painter is taking inspiration from President Trump's 2016 election campaign  later this hour.</p><p>And I'll speak exclusively with the CEO of Hologic, Steve MacMillan is  here.  We're getting his take on where the company's quarterly earnings  are, the health of the health care industry.  They make those 3D  mammography machines.  You'll want to hear from him.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Earnings alert -- global women's health giant Hologic reporting third  quarter earnings last night.  The company reporting earnings 58 cents a  share on $824 million in revenue -- both above analyst expectations for the  quarter.  The medical technology company also raising its full year  earnings and revenue guidance.</p><p>And joining me right now in a Fox Business Exclusive is the CEO of Hologic  -- Steve MacMillan.  Great to see you Steve.  Thanks very much for joining  us.</p><p>STEVE MACMILLAN, CEO, HOLOGIC:  Great to see you again -- Maria.  Thanks  for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What drove the quarter from your standpoint?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  I think the best part was really the standout in our breast  health business as well as our international business.  And breast health  just e continues to be very strong with our 3D mammography.  We continue to  get more clinical claims.  </p><p>You know, we're now approved for dense breasts.  We're the only ones that  have 3D for dense breasts.  And we just keep gaining market share in the  U.S.</p><p>And then internationally where we made a lot of investments a couple years  ago also really paying off.  We've had seven straight quarters of double  digit international growth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to talk about international growth for sure.  And I also  want to get your take on the tariffs conversation we're having. </p><p>But in terms of the breast health and the 3D mammography machines, this is  a really important product.  It's really driven your business for the last  couple years I would say.</p><p>Tell us about the false positives.  When you having something so specific  like that, 3D mammography, are there more false positives for women than  not?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  No.  I'm so glad you asked that.  The great part about the 3D  is it's dramatically reducing the number of false positives.  So what we  have going on is we're both finding more cancers earlier, but we've been  dramatically reducing the false positives.</p><p>And as you know, that's one of the big problems with, you know, 2D and the  older technologies and then the result of that is you're asking women to go  in and have biopsies that don't even need them.</p><p>So I think the great part about 3D, and it's probably the hidden gem, while  it was designed to detect cancers better, it's actually reduced the false  positives by large percentage.  So we've got a lot fewer women having to  get biopsies that don't need them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's been a feeling that you have to get a mammography when  you're 50?  Is that still the line that doctors are prescribing?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Well very much -- and really -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even lower -- younger.</p><p>MACMILLAN:  Mostly 40, unless you have a history of breast cancer in your  family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Usually 40, unless you have a history, then you do it at 50.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  No, then you should even come younger if there's a history in  the family because, you know, there are women in their 20s and 30s that we  are often diagnosing depending on if they had a history.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is there a danger to getting a mammography too soon?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  You know, there's always some concerns about radiation  exposure.  The reality is the radiation exposure is less than a cross- country airplane flight.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>MACMILLAN:  You know, so I think it's one of those myths that's a lot  bigger.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  That's an important myth.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  You never want to overdo it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean -- </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Well, yes.  You hear people talk about it and in fact it's very  little exposure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me about the international business.  Where was the  growth?  And what are you expecting to be the big drivers in the coming  years?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Sure.  I think what we're really excited about is actually both  our European and our Asian business -- but our European business is showing  some really strong growth behind really all of our franchises -- our breast  health business, our diagnostics business, as well as our surgical  business.</p><p>And we put new leadership into our European business a few years ago.   They've really gotten their sea legs and are really driving the business  behind all of our products.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So do you think that you're going to get tariffed on your  mammography machines?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  We are a little worried about that, you know.  We'll see where  this goes.  As were you talking earlier, you know, I'm not sure tariffs are  really the great way to fight some of these battles.</p><p>China has now talked about putting tariffs on mammography machines.  You  know, we're actually one of the rare companies that still produces 100  percent of our mammography machines are actually made in Danbury,  Connecticut -- right up the road.  We're probably the last people that  actually produce in Connecticut of all things.  But you know.</p><p>So we are a net exporter of our machines because of the quality, everything  else.  We've made it.  So it is that uncertainty as we go into next year.   The analysts, of course are trying to figure out what would be the impact.   So, you know, we would prefer that the tariff stuff kind of dies down here  and gets settled. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has your business been with China?  Do you have to partner  up with a Chinese company?  And did you feel that you were having to force  technology and innovation to the Chinese?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  It's always been that challenge.  We had actually made a couple  of small acquisitions there that, frankly, didn't pan out very well.  It's  the classic you buy them and then the people leave and kind of start up a  competitor.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, after you transferred your technology.  That's what  the President is trying to stop.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Exactly.  So that's -- as you were talking earlier, it's the  intellectual property theft that's probably the bigger issue there -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.</p><p>MACMILLAN:  -- and it's the harder issue to address.  So we're now building  our business more steadily with our own employees there we can monitor the  practices.  It's a little slower build but it's much more enduring and  should prevail over time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about Cynosure -- this was sort of the blow-up that  everybody was worried about in the last quarter.  Have things stabilized?   What can you tell us about Cynosure right now?</p><p>MACMILLAN:  Sure.  You know, this is clearly an acquisition we did a little  over a year ago to get into the medical aesthetics space.  Culturally it's  been a bigger transition for us.  You know, for a company that's deeply  rooted in science and strong clinical evidence, we thought we could bring  that to the medical aesthetics industry.  And it's exactly what we are  bringing to it.</p><p>The cultural shift right at the beginning, we lost some salespeople as we  clamped down on some practices.  But I think the great part about this  quarter was the team that stayed plus the new team really starting to  deliver.  And I think that was the real excitement in the report last night  that we exceeded the estimates for the quarter on that business.</p><p>And I think it's taken us a year but we've got it on track now and feeling  really good that we can bring more science to that part of the industry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've also announced that you're acquiring Faxitron Bioptics  for $85 million, along with a shift in the corporate management structure.   At this point, are there more holes to fill in terms of acquisitions?  Tell  us what this acquisition does.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Sure, this is a great one.  You know, part of -- as we're  identifying cancers earlier in women, we're able -- one of the growth areas  is actually what we call breast conserving surgery.  So instead of women  having to have full-blown mastectomies as we confine cancer smaller and  earlier; one of the key areas is to be able to go in and just remove the  cancer and not have to take out the whole breast.</p><p>So Faxitron actually has some of the localization technology that help the  surgeons mark it and be able to just go in and get just the cancer.  You  know, in the old days, you think about surgery, how it's evolved and  everything -- whether it's hips, knees, you know, breast, anything.  We'd  just go in and -- you know, carve out as much as we can.  And everything is  trying to get smaller and smaller.  So, Faxitron is going to fit  beautifully into that space for us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's fantastic.  The House voted to repeal the medical device  tax last week.  If this tax ends up being implemented in 2020, what effect  does it have on the company?  We've talked about this medical device tax  for a while.  Tell -- give us the status check.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Yes, you know, we were very pleased with the House vote.  We  love -- we would love to see the senate come along and do the same thing.  </p><p>As you know, the medical device industry is very different say than most  industries.  And that, it's characterized by a lot of small startup  companies.  And that 2.3 percent sales tax, you know, it's an excise tax,  it's not an income tax, it's a huge barrier to innovation in the industry.  </p><p>So, you know, I think all of us when that tax first went away boosted our  R&amp;D spending, everything else, and putting it into innovation which is  where we want to see and that's what's fueling the innovation in the  industry.  So, we would love to get that more permanently repealed and we  were very pleased with the House action.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Between that and the tariffs, are you poised to raise prices?  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  You know, increasingly it's a tougher market to raise prices.   You know, we've got to look at some of those things, particularly if the  tariffs go into effect in China, you know, it's probably going to have to  be some higher pricing over there.  You know, if the tax came back, we're  going to have to pass some of that on.  We can't absorb all of it  ourselves.  So, you know, those -- you know, we were big winners from the  tax cuts earlier in the year and that's been great because we used that to  fuel additional investments.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Steve, great to see you.  </p><p>MACMILLAN:  Great, thanks Maria.  Thanks for having us.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  We'll be watching the developments.  Steve  MacMillan a Hologic CEO.</p><p>Coming up, a judge temporarily halts plans for printing 3D guns.  Judge  Andrew Napolitano breaks down the latest legal developments on that, right  here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, August  1st.  Your top stories right now, 07:34 on the East Coast.  </p><p>Trade tensions, a new report suggests that the Trump administration is  ready to more than double tariffs on certain goods from China.  This as the  U.S. is still lacking trade negotiations with the country.  President Trump  touting his tariff plans effects on American workers at last night's rally  in Florida.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thanks to our tariffs, our  steelworkers are back on the job, American steel mills are back, open for  business.  We are starting to set new records and nobody believed it could  happen this quickly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Investors are watching the president's decision on trade, also  awaiting the Federal Reserve decision coming up this afternoon.  This could  be a key sign about possible future interest rate hikes.  We're not  expecting an increase in rates today.  </p><p>Markets are lower, Dow Industrials down about 30 points, the S&amp;P 500 flat,  down one point, but the NASDAQ is up, it's up 15 points, it's a quarter of  a percent higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>This after markets closed higher on Tuesday after a strong earnings showing  from industrials.  The Dow Jones Industrial average was up 108 points at  the close, one half of one percent.  S&amp;P 500 was also up a half a percent  and the NASDAQ was up half a percent, 42 points higher yesterday.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed performances, take a look.  Largely lower,  the FT-100 down a hundred points right now, that's 1-1/4 percent.  The DAX  Index down 31 points, that's a quarter of a percent, the CAC Quarante in  Paris is flat.  </p><p>The markets finishing mixed in Asia last night.  Meanwhile, China the worst  performer, losing about two percent on the session as you can see there.   The Hang Seng also under water.  </p><p>Lots of earnings reports coming out today.  Once again, we are waiting on  Tesla.  It will report after the close tonight.  The company reportedly  plan to invest $5 billion to build a factory in China.  Stock up a quarter  of a percent going into the quarter.  </p><p>And grounded, Southwest making a change to its flights.  We will tell you  what flying staple got kicked off the plane, coming up.  </p><p>Check out this painting by a Utah artist of the Trump administration  crossing the swamp in D.C.  We'll bring you the story behind this art that  is going viral this morning on the internet.  </p><p>And it's the super boy is a real aqua lad.  This 10-year-old boy just beat  a swimming record set by Michael Phelps in 1995.  You won't believe was his  name is either.  We'll tell you all about it.</p><p>First, our top story this half an hour, and that is this, 3-D printed guns,  a judge blocking the plan to release a 3-D printed gun blueprint yesterday.   Just hours before they were expected to hit the internet.  Defense  distributed, the company that makes the designs, planned to make them  available online for virtually anybody to see them and to download.  The  judge siding with at least eight states, plus D.C., that are suing to halt  publication of these designs.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Fox News senior judicial  analyst.  Judge, good to see you.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's just the plans to make a 3-D gun.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, this is even though the right to keep and bear arms is  protected by the second amendment, this is a first amendment case.  This is  a case about the freedom of speech because you have a document, which is  truthful and accurate and scientific, which the State Department  inexplicably it's a head scratcher told the young man that created it, that  he could posting on the internet.  So, it's an expression of an idea and  the court is stopping him from doing so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When did State Department say that it was a good idea?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Gosh, within the past month or so.  </p><p>See, he originally posted it and people were buying it overseas.  That's  make it regulable (ph) by the Federal Government.  Are you selling  something overseas without a license?  He persuaded -- his lawyers  persuaded State Department lawyers that he wasn't selling it, that he was  just posting plans for it.  He doesn't provide you with the -- with the  gun.  He just provides you with the plans.  </p><p>So, the Mike Pompeo State Department said, even though it's a federal  statute that prohibits owning, possessing, transporting or manufacturing a  gun without a piece -- without metal in it, it's called the Undetectable  Weapons Act of 1988, Reagan era, there was no impediment to posting this.  </p><p>So, he posts it.  It was downloaded by about a thousand people.  I think it  was downloaded by more people.  There is actually more than one version  out.  Eight attorneys -- state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in  Seattle.  And the Seattle judge said, I think there's potentially a  reparable harm here.  So, I'm going to stop you from posting it.  And the  young man stopped immediately.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know where this is going to go, I don't think -- I  just read the judge's opinion a few minutes ago.  I don't think he  adequately addressed the first amendment issues.  First amendment issues  are these.  Can the government engage in what we call prior restraint?  </p><p>This is not punishing speech after it comes out of your mouth.  This is  preventing it from coming out of your mouth.  This is -- this is something  rarely if ever done in American history but this judge has done it.  I  think he'll be reversed by the Ninth Circuit.  I mean, think about it.  You  can go into a public library, a library owned by the government and find a  book telling you how to make a bomb, you can find a book telling you how to  make a plastic gun.  Why can't you find this on the internet?  </p><p>The problem is, people will use these to harm themselves and to harm others  and it's a substantial impediment to law enforcement to trace them.  You  can use this gun and then just destroy the gun.  Because it's just a piece  of plastic.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does this gun work like any other gun once it's made?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If it's made properly.  There are many videos out there  showing you exploding in people's hands.  Because it depends upon whether  you craft it properly, the mixture you use to make the -- to make --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it could -- it could?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's hard to detect when you go through security in the  airport.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's not metal.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The fellow who is behind all this, has put two pieces of metal  in his.  So, when he brings it into a courtroom to show to a judge, it is  not unlawful if it has metal on it.  Because if it has metal on it, it's  detectable.  If there's no metal in it, it's not detectable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's illegal everywhere in the U.S.  </p><p>MURPHY:  But Judge, with -- in this day and age we live right now, with the  internet.  Where everybody having access to it.  Like you say, you can  figure out how to build a bomb there, you can do a lot of bad things that  you can learn on the internet.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  That's not going to change, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MURPHY:  That's not going away.  And that's going to be forever.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>MURPHY:  Isn't this just another part of that?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, I think the injunction is fruitless.  Because this is --  this is human knowledge.  Now, it could be used for good.  It could be used  to repel an invader in your house.  It could be used for evil.  But you  can't stop the march of human knowledge by a judge's injunction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cody Wilson, he's the founder of Defense Distributed.</p><p>MURPHY:  That's the guy were talking about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He agreed to stop posting any new blueprints online until  September, he said, when -- while the lawsuit makes its way through the  courts.  </p><p>And in an interview yesterday, he explained the reason behind his decision  to post the instructions online.  Here's what he says.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CODY WILSON, FOUNDER, DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED:  I believe that I'm championing  the second amendment in the 21st century.  I think access to the firearm is  a fundamental human dignity, it's a fundamental human right.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know who called it the fundamental human right?   Justice Scalia in a famous opinion called Heller versus the District of  Columbia which basically found that the second amendment protects a  personal, pre-political.  Meaning they existed before the government human  right to keep and bear arms.  So, what he's saying is not radical.  And  it's perfectly consistent with the -- with the Supreme Court.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the president signaled yesterday that he's on defense.   He tweeted this, he said I'm looking into 3-D plastic guns being sold to  the public, already spoke to NRA, doesn't seem to make much sense, Dagen.   That's what the --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The NRA actually championed the 1988 law which prohibited guns  that don't have any metal in them.  This is the Reagan era law that I  mentioned -- that I mentioned earlier.  I don't know that this made its way  up the food chain in the State Department.  I don't know that Mike the  Secretary of State knew about this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Because it is a real head-scratcher that a decision like this  could be made without the broad consensus of the Trump administration  behind it.  So, I don't know where it's going to go.  But let me scare you  a little bit.  This is in the Ninth Circuit.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, here we go.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They're going to reverse -- they're going to reverse the  Seattle judge probably this afternoon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If there's an appeal.  And I don't know if there's going to be  an appeal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So where would -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Because Cody Wilson, the young man you just plays it, I'm  going to obey the court's order.  I'm not going to do anything until  September.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Ninth Circuit always goes against President Trump, we knew  that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Where would Scalia stand on this you think?  Because, again,  wasn't it in Heller that he wrote that American people have the right to  arm themselves the way that the government does.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think Justice Scalia would be in favor of the free speech  argument, which is that you cannot suppress an idea and you cannot suppress  technology.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But does this go all the way up to the Supreme Court?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, it does -- yes, it does, probably after Judge Kavanaugh  is there.  And he's a fierce defender of the second amendment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You jump ahead there, judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Where is he on the first?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're trying to have Judge Kavanaugh in place by October One.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, good to see you.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Judge Andrew Napolitano.  </p><p>Coming up, a new policy for Southwest Airlines takes flight.  We will tell  you about the shakeup, next.  </p><p>And then, a painting getting patriotic, the new art inspired by President  Trump coming up right here, that's going viral right now.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Southwest Airlines says good-bye to peanuts for  good.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  End of an era, Maria.  It's been a tradition on Southwest for  decades.  But starting today, peanuts are going to be grounded at the  airline.  Yesterday, the last day that the company offered them to  passengers.  Southwest says it's concerned about peanut allergies.  Taking  a look at shares of Dallas, Texas based Southwest Airlines, stocks down 11  percent this year.  </p><p>All right, speaking of Dallas, thankfully nobody was hurt when a two-story  parking garage partially collapsed there yesterday.  Fire Department says  its rescue team along with K-9's confirmed nobody was inside any of the  smashed cars.  21 cars were damaged.  Images show the gaping hole in the  garage and vehicles piled against one another.  An investigation under way  to determine what happened.  </p><p>Well, White House chief of staff John Kelly agreed to stay in his job  through the 2020 election at President Trump's request.  Kelly told his  senior aides decision on Monday which marked his first anniversary in the  role.  There was months of speculation that the chief of staff was on his  way out.  But no, he is staying put.  </p><p>Take a look at this, a painting meant to depict President Trump and his  team navigating the Washington swamp has touched off a social media frenzy.   This is from artist Jon McNaughton.  He shared his painting called Crossing  the Swamp on Twitter.  The painting of course, a ref on Washington crossing  the Delaware, very famous painting (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>Those on Twitter were quick to mock it though.  Some point it out that  Donald Trump Jr. didn't make the crew?  And Carson looks like he's rowing  backwards.  Also, Melania Trump wouldn't be caught dead wearing camo.  Just  some of the fun comments coming from that one.  I kind of agree with the  Melania thing.  That's -- yes, (INAUDIBLE) Anyway, get back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this picture.  </p><p>CASONE:  The artist is a big President Trump supporter, we should say.  He  loves President Trump and loves his agenda, so.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It's a great picture.  I do think Ben Carson is rowing backwards  though.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, my dad texted this to me this last night.  He thought it  was great.  My dad's not a prolific texter.  So that's like -- you know  it's going viral when Ronnie Ortagus and (INAUDIBLE) Florida is texting it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These Sarah Sanders. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  But I think my dad loves the camo because he's a big hunter.  I  have to say like, holding the gun correctly (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know why people say she wouldn't wear that jacket,  Cheryl.  Because she had that other jacket on that says who cares, right?  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  She's got the smolder, the Dagen McDowell smolder.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, that's just great, that's just unbridled resting you know  what face.  By the way, I have love this stuff, because anything to make  people on the left lose their minds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, yes, they already have Trump syndrome, so.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  And by the way, they don't even know that like  conservatives and even the president himself, they're taunting you, they're  trying to make you even more upset.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you give in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what's so genius.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're going insane over the outcomes.  That's for sure.</p><p>Coming up, a 10-year-old boy breaks Michael Phelps' long-standing record.   The super human stunt.  </p><p>Plus, you won't believe what his name is.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So get this, a 10-year-old boy breaks Michael  Phelps' long-standing record.  But first we begin with a historic night in  baseball.  Jared Max with all the details.  Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX SPORTS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We saw  things we had never seen before.  Question: what do the New York Mets have  in common with Serena Williams?  Both suffered their most lopsided losses  ever on Tuesday.  </p><p>While Serena was beaten 6-1-6 love in the Silicon Valley Classic the Mets  dipped into a valley of unchartered depths.  They trailed the nationals 7-0  after one inning, 19-0 after five innings.  Haven't seen such a score since  1876.  It was 19-1 nationals in the eighth inning.  </p><p>When the Mets brought infielder Jose Reyes in to pitch for the first time  in his career.  Reyes, gave up two home runs and then on a 54 mile per hour  fast ball he also hit Ryan Zimmerman who would pretend to charge the mound.  </p><p>The final score last night, well, the Mets' official Twitter can't even  look, see no evil.  As the New York post says today, it was bad as it Mets.  </p><p>Final score Nationals 25, the Mets four.  The worst loss ever for the Mets.   And the biggest win for the Nationals (INAUDIBLE) ball card.</p><p>Atlanta marked a day in sports all around.  NBA Commissioner Adam Silver  announced last night, the NBA and WNBA have become north America's first  major pro sports league to form a relationship with a sports gambling  house, MGM Resorts.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Adam Silver, Commissioner NBA:  We said let's take advantage of this  opportunity to do something historic.  And that is to enter into the first  commercial partnership between a gaming establishment and the NBA.   Integrity provisions, to protect our fans, to protect those who choose to  engage and bet on the NBA.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  The deal reported to be worth at least $25 million.  MGM is allowed  to market itself using NBA highlights, names, logos and direct data feed  from the league.  </p><p>With a name like Clark Kent you figure one is bound for superstardom.  10- year-old swimming phenom, Clark Kent Apuada swims for the Monterey County  Aquatic Team.  Now, this was his time Saturday at the 100-meter butterfly  Far West International Championship.  Now, this is the time that Michael  Phelps set a record in back in 1995.  More than a full second slower than  Clark Kent Apuada whose nickname is Superman.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLARK KENT APUADA, SWIMMER, MONTEREY COUNTY AQUATIC TEAM:  Always have fun  and never give up on your dreams no matter what anybody says and, yes, that  was one of my dreams, to beat Michael Phelps.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  With a name like Clark Kent, how could you go wrong?  So, Michael  Phelps foreseeing his records --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love this kid.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Great stuff.  So, the NBA gambling things are really big deal.  A  $25 million deal though -- I mean, that's like a backup power ford in the  NBA, right now.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  I mean, shouldn't there be more money there?  </p><p>MAX:  Yes, that surprised me a little bit that it was that little of couple  things here.  Commissioner Adam Silver has been vocal publicly from the  start about the when they legalize why spread gambling start to reach with  New Jersey about this integrity fee.  That they want a cut of the action,  essentially.  So, they're moving in here, at least in this regard, with  MGM.  </p><p>But boy, you think of the irony.  It was just a decade ago that Tim  Donaghy, the former NBA referee disgraced ref who went to jail for betting  on games and making calls to work in his favor on the points spread, who  would have -- what would have been the odds that the NBA would become the  first league to get in bed with sports casinos.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) is cheating and gambling is money.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  I wonder also that does as this days go on, Pete Rose.  What  does this do for him?  As they start to see, boy, things are changing.  You  know, I can never get in the Hall of Fame but they're doing.  What's Tim  Donaghy thinking this morning?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  Jared, thank you.  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports  reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or on Sirius Radio XM 115.</p><p>Still ahead, Facebook under fire again this morning.

Good  Wednesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.   I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Wednesday, August 1st.  Your top stories  right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast, renewed trade tensions this morning  have markets under pressure.  Reports say that the White House is looking  to raise tariffs on China to 25 percent up from the expected 10 percent.   President Trump doubled down on his tough trade talk last night at a rally  in Florida. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thanks to our powerful trade  policies.  The trade deficit is falling and falling and falling.  And boy,  did it fall this quarter.  The days of plundering American jobs and  American wealth, those days are over.  They're over.  America first. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The trade uncertainty weighing on markets this morning.  Dow  Industrials down about 30 points right now.  The NASDAQ however is up.   It's up 18-1/2 points.  Apple is doing well this morning on the heels of  earnings.  We are waiting on the ADP report due in 15 minutes time.  This  is the first look on the health of the labor market leading up to Friday's  jobs report.  We have an expectation of 185,000 jobs created in that ADP  private payrolls report which we will bring to you as soon as it hits the  tape. </p><p>We're also watching the Federal Reserve.  Two-day meeting ends today.  No  change in rates expected.  But we will be looking for signals from the fed  about future interest rate hikes and what the rest of the year looks like.   We'll hear from them at 2:00 today.  Just have the gains across the board  yesterday for stocks, Dow Industrials picking up 100 points, one half of  one percent.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also up a half percent apiece.  NASDAQ  was up 42 points yesterday. </p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly lower.  FT-100 is down 1-1/4  percent, a hundred points lower on the financial times, 100 index.  The CAC  Quarante in Paris is down a fraction and the DAX Index in Germany is down  three-quarters of a percent, 90 points higher -- I'm sorry, 90 points lower  this morning.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances, China was the worst  performer.  Shanghai Composite down almost two percent on the session. </p><p>Finally coming home, the remains in American heroes killed in the Korean  War on their way back right now to the United States.  A repatriation  ceremony was held in South Korea overnight.  And Vice President Mike Pence  is arriving in Hawaii.  He arrived earlier this morning in Hawaii for a  ceremony there tonight.  We will take you there live later this hour.   Tackling election interference meanwhile, Facebook has pulled dozens of  accounts off of the site as the Senate Intelligence Committee gears up for  a hearing this morning on what is happening at Facebook. </p><p>The fallout coming up.  The race to one trillion dollars, Apple reporting a  big beat last night with its earnings and the stock is set to open at an  all-time high.  A new record with a gain of four percent on the on session  and that would be if it hit, Dagen, $203 a share. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And 45 cents. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  203.45 means it will be one trillion dollars in market value.   Also on the earnings front this morning, Tesla in focus.  We are watching  that after the close tonight.  Analysts and investors keeping a close eye  on the company's cash burn when it reports its quarterly numbers after the  close tonight.  And the big business of fracking creating a hot commodity.   We will take you to the Permian Basin for a look at the soaring demand for  sand. </p><p>That's transforming one Texas town.  All those stories coming up this  Wednesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down Fox Business  Network's Dagen McDowell, the CEO and Managing Partner of Rosecliff, Mike  Murphy, and National Security Analyst, Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see  everybody this morning. </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  Good morning. </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Morning.  Big news today. </p><p>MURPHY:  Happy to be here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy to see you exactly especially when we got earnings doing  well and Apple is really soaring this morning. </p><p>MURPHY:  Apple is the story of the day for sure.  Largest market cap out  there.  Put up a great quarter.  I think you're seeing it pretty close to  the highs of the morning this morning, and it's going to be a lot more  there.  I think the push to 203 is going to be a big story.  I think it  gets there. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We wonder if one trillion dollars in market value represents,  Dagen, one of these sort of round numbers that people look at and say, OK,  no other reason to sell other than at a trillion dollars.  I'll do that now  even though all the metrics are looking really good.  Does that represent a  barrier? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Probably not because the -- because demand -- one of the things  driving the stock we should point out is the promise to come in May to  spend a hundred billion dollars on stock buybacks.  So it continued to --  as the Journal puts it flex its muscle in the most recent quarter.  It  bought back $20 billion for the shares during that period and it helped  move the stock.  The shares are up.  We should point out 28 percent in the  last year.  So it's been -- it's been a nice solid run for Apple so far.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But still only trading at 15 multiple. </p><p>MURPHY:  Trading at a very low multiple and the numbers they put up across  all segments of the business were very strong.  And one thing we haven't  talk about yet, Maria, you walk around the streets of Manhattan, you'll see  more and more people wearing the AirPods, the little white -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why is that?  Why did those things take off because they're not  as good as the Bose -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't like them but -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MURPHY:  I love them.  You put them in your ear and then you can use your  phone.  You can do things while you have -- so I can talk to and check my  e-mail -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I do that with my wife.  My -- with my wired earphones. </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  But you can also strangle yourself with the wire -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Morgan said because they're smaller.  But there's something  that's happened.  There has to be some sort of online social media  influence or -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- no, but it happened.  It's -- because it should have happened  immediately if they were so awesome, but it didn't.  It's -- in the last  like three months, Mike Murphy, it's you -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MURPHY:  And the Apple Watch also if you look around. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the Apple Watch has got gained a lot of popularity, so we  got the ADP coming out soon.  But out top story is renewed trade tensions.   President Trump talking tough on trade last night at his rally in Tampa,  Florida promising to rebuild the U.S. after years of unfair trade deals.   Blake Burman is at the White House now with more details there.  Blake,  good morning to you. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to  you as well.  One of the big campaign style rallies in Florida last night  for President Trump in which he indeed defended his trade policy.  It comes  as The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that the President's  team and the President himself could ratchet up this trade battle against  China with the next batch of tariffs 200 billion potentially hitting as  high as 25 percent. </p><p>Here is what I can tell you this morning.  There are some within the  President's trade team who are indeed if not pushing discussing this 25  percent number on the next potential $200 billion.  This really shouldn't  come as any sort of surprise though, Maria, considering we know that the  President has different voices within his trade team on different sides.   The -- of the opinion as to how to go about China and this 25 percent  number has been out there in other instances. </p><p>For example, the steel tariffs are at 25 percent.  The first batch of  tariffs currently at $34 billion right now at 25 percent.  The President  last night in his rally in Florida said that the farmers he as least  suggested that maybe they could hold the line as it relates to the back- and-forth with China.  As you know, China and other nations have  specifically targeted the agriculture community and here's what the  President said last night about the farmers. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I want to thank our farmers.  Our farmers are true patriots because  China and others have targeted -- China and others remember this, have  targeted our farmers.  Not good.  Not nice.  And you know what our farmers  are saying?  It's OK.  We can take it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  The President also tapped of the economy last night, the 4.1 GDP  reading.  He also talked about the potential government shutdown that is  could be looming here.  The President is saying, \"We may have to do some  pretty drastic things.\"  And then I did the mention, Maria, this was wide- ranging at one point the President also said that he has been the most  Presidential since Abraham Lincoln.  We've seen him on the trail say it  before, again last night, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Blake, thanks so much.  Blake Burman at the White  House.  President Trump keeping the focus on economic development during  yesterday's rally.  But the governor primary elections are also on  everybody's mind.  Joining us right now is Florida Agricultural  Commissioner and Republican gubernatorial candidate, Adam Putnam.   Commissioner, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>ADAM PUTNAM, AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER OF FLORIDA:  Good to be with you.   Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you applauded the President's tariffs because you say they  helped Florida farmers.  Do you still feel this way even though there's all  of this uncertainty around? </p><p>PUTNAM:  Look, as farmer myself and as Commissioner of Agriculture, I've  had a front row seat to see how these poorly negotiated trade agreements  have devastated Florida farmers and Florida ranchers, and it's not just  China.  It's also Mexico.  They manipulate their currency values.  They  don't abide.  The administrations in the past have not enforced the trade  agreements that were on the books.  So no one wants a protracted trade war  it.  But I'm glad to see President Trump fighting for American workers and  Florida farmers. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know that you welcome the President last night.  But, you  know, the President reaffirmed his endorsement of Congressman Ron DeSantis  for governor.  Here's what he said. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We need to elect more Republicans.  We need more votes.  And we  need to elect Ron DeSantis as your governor.  Got to do it.  And I'm  telling you I know him well.  He's a great, great guy.  He's going to be an  incredible governor.  I have no doubt.  I have no doubt.  I don't do these  endorsements easily.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you're reporting strong support in the state and you got  the endorsement from the A.G. Pam Bondi, but what are your thoughts in  terms of where you are right now with this race? </p><p>PUTNAM:  Well, I put A.G. Bondi up against anybody in terms of endorsements  and then you add to it that nearly 50 of Florida sheriffs who know how  strong I am in support of law enforcement and protecting our citizens, and  I'll -- and I'll take that.  Look, we are glad to have the President in  Florida last night and I guarantee you that there were a lot of people in  that rally who are Trump-Putnam voters and Trump-Putnam supporters. </p><p>Floridians can distinguish between what's going on in Washington and what's  going on in Florida.  And Florida is on a roll.  We don't want more of  what's not happening in Washington to come to Florida.  Thanks for Governor  Scott.  We're a trillion dollar economy.  We've traded a million and a half  new jobs in the last seven and a half years.  And our economy and our  growth is the envy of the nation.  So if you want more of that, you need a  governor who knows Florida, who knows our state from one end to the other,  and has a plan, has specific agenda to put Florida first. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Good morning, commissioner.  This is your old employee, Morgan  Ortagus.  My -- I told Maria tonight, my first job was with Adam Putnam.  I  owe you my whole career, sir.  And speaking of Florida, I know you're a  fifth generation Floridian and I know the reputation that you have on Polk  County, our home county.  Tell us the differences between you and DeSantis  in terms of your plans for Florida?  We know that he's a Washington, you  know, have been quite prolific in Washington. </p><p>But what's the difference between both of your plans for Florida? </p><p>PUTNAM:  Well, I think the biggest difference is that I have a plan for  Florida.  The congressman has been very active and very focused on  Washington agenda issues.  But I put forward a plan for Florida jobs,  Florida families, and Florida public safety.  I think the biggest  difference is -- and it was the reason why the President was here on his  official visit in terms of touting vocational education.  I've put forward  a very specific plan on putting vocational and technical training back into  our middle schools, back into our high schools, so that we can diversify  Florida's economy and rebuild our middle class beyond simply tourism,  agriculture, and construction. </p><p>That's going to lead to an even stronger state economy than we already are  enjoying. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will be watching the race.  Good to see you.   Adam Putnam, thanks very much. </p><p>PUTNAM:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we'll be focused on jobs this week when we have our special  coverage of jobs in America coverage this Friday at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.   Don't forget to join us Friday morning as we get the jobs numbers and we  identify where the jobs are.  First though, honoring America's heroes.   We're taking you live to Hawaii next as Vice President Mike Pence arrives  to receive the remains of fallen soldiers from the Korean War.  That's  next.  Then we are awaiting the July ADP report.  The numbers right after  this break.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are awaiting the July ADP report, the  consensus expectation is 158,000 jobs created -- 218 is the number.  219 is  the number, 219,000 jobs created for the ADP report for the month of July,  158,000 was the estimate, Mike Murphy, that's much better than expected,  219,000.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Much better than expected.  But I think this is the new norm.  I  think you're going to see beats is going forward because the economy is  actually stronger than there's more demand out there for workers than what  people are giving credit for.  So I think this is a massive number.  The  only -- if you want to throw a cold water here, you're going to start  seeing people talking about the economy heat growing too quickly as the fed  going to have to do something to slow it down. </p><p>But I would dismiss that completely, you know, the fact that you have  strong jobs' report is nothing but a positive for the country, for the  economy, for people who want jobs.  This is great. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No major reaction from markets, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You could see, so we're going to hear from the Federal Reserve  this week.  Don't expect an interest rate hike.  They will be adjusting  potentially their growth forecast for the economy looking ahead to Friday.   What -- it's possible that the estimates on job creation do go up because  of this number slightly because it beats so handily on the private sector  job creation right now total nonfarm jobs were expecting a creation of  190,000 jobs in the month of July.  In June, the actual was 213,000, so  maybe you get an uptick in that estimate.  But again to your point in how  health of the economy is, we have wages according -- we found out yesterday  growing at the fastest pace in nearly a decade, 2.8 percent, and that's  what creates people feeling flush and better. </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  And that the consumer then feels good and the consumer goes  out and spends money.  There -- there's -- and we talked about slow growth  or non-existent growth from one or two percent growth for so long.  Now,  we're seeing real growth.  We're seeing an economy that's truly growing.   This is good for not only workers but small, medium, large businesses  across the country.  This is good for the American people -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That wage number was really strong yesterday. </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, we have to pay up -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Go ahead. </p><p>MURPHY:  As a -- as a business owner, you have to pay up if you need to put  people to work and there's not enough workers out there.  I have to pay you  more than the next guy in order to get you to come in the door. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what does this mean for the Federal Reserve?  I know we're  not expecting a rate hike today, but we're going to hear commentary about  what's to come and you wonder if this dictates what they're going to say -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, for sure.  But, you know, the fed has been very data  dependent, you know, they've kind of -- we have their overall game plan but  they're watching what the data and what data comes out of the economy.  So  you look at this maybe it calls for another quarter point rate hike.  But  if it's based on strong underlying fundamentals, I think it's a good thing  overall.  We need it.  We need to get back to more normalized interest rate  environment.  So if it's backed by strong fundamentals which it would be,  I'm fine with it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by the way, I do think it also plays in.  It's not just  financial and economic.  It's also the political message particularly from  the left and I would encourage there was one congressman from California  who tweeted yesterday and I won't name him.  You can probably figure it out  who it is.  He's a democrat.  He was talking, of course, they were tweeting  about collusion and he said -- he said that the President didn't collude  with anyone to increase your pay. </p><p>Well, guess what?  People's pay is going up at the fastest pace that we've  seen in a decade or bring down your healthcare costs, or let you dream  bigger for your kids.  To the democrats, you know what, if the parents who  dream for their kids not the federal government, so I think people need to  stop lying about what's happening in this nation -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We love the word collusion.  They -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- colluding and nailed that.  So -- all right.  We got  marching stat are off of the lows for sure.  Dow Industrials still negative  by 25.  NASDAQ is up 21.  And we do have a bit of an expected ADP report.   Join us for a special coverage on Friday when we get the labor department  numbers out.  We'll see if this actually leads to more estimate increases  for that number as Dagen mentioned earlier.  Meanwhile, there's this.   Honoring America's heroes, the remains of dozens of soldiers killed during  the Korean War making their way back home today. </p><p>The first ceremony taking place overnight at the Osan Air Base in South  Korea.  And then tonight, Vice President Mike Pence will receive them in  Hawaii.  He arrived in the Aloha State early this morning.  \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\"  weekend co-host Pete Hegseth traveled with the vice President and he joins  us now from Hawaii.  Pete, good morning to you. </p><p>PETE HEGSETH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:  Hey, good morning.  It was --  it was a powerful flight because halfway from New York to here in Hawaii,  we landed in Travis Air Force Base in California and picked up two  families.  They were both young kids, three and four years old when their  fathers both lieutenant went to fight in the Korean War, both pilots or  members of flight crews both shutdown and never found. </p><p>So here we are 16 years later receiving what we believe are 55 remains or  55 boxes that will be delivered here at Hickam Air Force Base at 2:00 local  time.  The vice President will be there to receive them as part of the  process of identifying who these men and women maybe will be ongoing.  But  it's a powerful symbol of the ongoing negotiations with North Korea.  I had  a chance to sit down with briefly with the vice President on Air Force Two  on the flight here. </p><p>I'm going to do a full interview with him later on today.  But what became  clear generally in the comments was they see this as a very significant  measure from the North Koreans, a good faith measure.  We didn't pay spend  any money for these particular hostages.  There was no -- overall deal  made.  They were given and I say as a vet myself, it's a great day when any  of those boys who had been forgotten on foreign soil make their way home. </p><p>So we're going to get a chance to welcome them home today at the Air Force  Base, powerful symbol of America's commitment to our war fighters and I  say, welcome home boys. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, Pete, how hard will it be to identify those remains  because it's incredible to me that there's only one dog tag and 55 remains? </p><p>HEGSETH:  Yes.  Yes.  It's going to take some time, DNA testing has  progressed.  And so, there -- and there's a database being built for family  members so they can identify them.  But a lot of the family members are --  don't believe necessarily mainly their father, but they're just gratefully  that anyone's father is coming back, so it's going to take some time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  Understood.  Pete, thank you.  Pete Hegseth is live in  Hawaii this morning.  Coming up, riding the Bitcoin roller coaster.  The  latest details as the cryptocurrency drops seven percent overnight.  Then  turning to desert into dollars?  We're headed to Texas to find out why sand  is bringing in billions of bucks.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A surprising and plentiful commodity in Texas  goes from practically worthless to high value.  Oil drillers need sand in  the fracking process and they're willing to pay billions to get it.  Our  own Connell McShane is live in Kermit, Texas at a sand lining facility.   Connell, how interesting.  How does it all work? </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know, it is  interesting, Maria, a couple of years ago, you come down here, and this  stand we're standing in the middle of all these sand dunes pretty much as  far as the eye can see was essentially worthless.  But to your point, well,  they improved that technology in the Permian Basin with the horizontal  drilling combined with the fracking process. </p><p>They realized the more sand the better and they realized that they had  plenty of it here in Texas, so companies started moving and instead of  shipping the sand from way out in Wisconsin, they do it much cheaper here  in Texas.  So we're in a place called high cross.  I got the plant manager  here, Gregg Edwards.  I'm going to introduce you to him.  You could  probably see the big plant they build in the background.  The one-year  anniversary, Gregg, good to see you, this plant, right, was yesterday? </p><p>GREGG EDWARDS, PLANT MANAGER:  Yesterday, July 31st. </p><p>MCSHANE:  So you've been here for one year and tell us exactly what you do  here, you know, this is it looks to us just like piles of sand but it can  be very useful in the oil business? </p><p>EDWARDS:  Exactly right.  If you notice where you just came from all the  sand we excavate it, we bring it to a plant that's behind us, main plant  you see here.  That's our wash plant.  We process it through the wash plant  with taking all the organics out, and then is put into a piles to dry or a  drain field.  Once it's down to a certain moisture content then we will put  it into our dry plant which is this big building.  There are three dry  plants in there.  Each one is capable of 150 ton an hour nameplate which  equates to three million tons of processed sand a year. </p><p>MCSHANE:  Let me ask you about the tons because the pricing is phenomenal  here because when they were bringing it from Wisconsin, it cost maybe a  hundred dollars a ton something like that.  You can do it for -- I think 40  or 50 dollars a ton here, so the company saved big time, right, the way the  process works? </p><p>EDWARDS:  It saves them and our customers quite a bit money if we process  it in Basin. </p><p>MCSHANE:  What's the future hold because some people would look at this and  say, boy, I wonder if it's going to hold on forever?  What do you think. </p><p>EDWARDS:  I think -- first, near-term and short, you know, eight years at  least, I'm seeing that it would be pretty profitable. </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  Gregg, nice to meet you.  We're going to have much  more here from throughout the day.  Just one of those great American  business stories, Maria, where you have one thing happening.  The boom in  the Permian Basin companies realized that.  They move into take advantage  of it and, you know, see how it works out.  But so far so good.  A lot of  money for a lot of sand. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  that's incredible.  Great story, Connell.  Thank you.  Connell  McShane live this morning in Texas.  Coming up, Facebook under fire again.   This morning, the backlash as the social media company removes dozens of  accounts.  That's coming up.  And then riding the Bitcoin roller coaster,  the latest details as the cryptocurrency dropped seven percent overnight.   We'll get a status check when we come right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 1,  your top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast.  Investors looking at a  first look at the Friday jobs' report this morning, with release of the  July ADP number.  The report was better than expected, with 219,000 private  sector jobs added to the economy last month versus an expectation of  185,000.  </p><p>Also, in investors' radar today, the Federal Reserve is not expected to  raise interest rates this afternoon but we are hearing from the Fed after a  two-day meeting and we will hear what they say about the future in terms of  the interest rate -- the interest rates to come.  Tougher tariffs to come  as well with the U.S. locked in trade negotiations with China.  A new  report this morning suggests that the Trump administration could more than  double tariffs on certain goods from China.  </p><p>Futures this morning look like this, after the ADP number, it was pretty  stable, we did see markets come off the lows but, as you can see, we are  still looking at a decline of 30 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average, 15 points higher on the NASDAQ this morning, and S&amp;P 500 is flat.   In Europe, this morning, the markets finished -- are trading lower, the FT- 100 is down 91 points, that's better than one percent lower.  The DAX Index  in Germany is down two-thirds of one percent, and the CAC Quarante in Paris  is down a fraction.  The markets finished mixed in Asia last night, the  worst performer was China, down 1.8 percent.  </p><p>Facebook is in the hot seat once again, an open-hearing today on Capitol  Hill, will look into election meddling through social media.  We have the  details of who will testify, this morning.  At a cybersecurity summit  yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence underscored the administration's  commitment to keeping our elections safe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I can assure you our  administration will continue to take strong action.  We've already done  more than any administration in American history to preserve the integrity  of the ballot box, and we've just begun.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The earnings trade, meanwhile, continues, all eyes on Tesla  this afternoon.  The company will reportedly invest $5 billion to build a  factory in China.  It is the race to a trillion dollars, meanwhile, Apple  third-quarter report beating expectations last night, putting the stock on  track for a record high opening this morning.  It is going to open at an  all-time high.  If it hits $203 a share on Apple, that would be $1 trillion  market value.  This is the premarket of Tesla, let's take a look at  premarket of Apple, and as you can see, the stock is up 4-1/3 percent.  If  it hits $203.40 that will be $1 trillion in market value for Apple, the  first company to do so.  A bit of trouble for Bitcoin, additional currency  taking a bit of a tumble on Tuesday.  We'll tell you if Bitcoin is worth  the money, it's at 7,571 right now.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, and that is fighting election  interference, Facebook now pulling plug on 32 accounts it says engaged in  coordinated political misinformation efforts ahead of November's midterm  elections.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, COO, FACEBOOK:  This kind of behavior is not allowed on  Facebook because we don't want organizations or individuals creating  networks of accounts that mislead people about who they are or what they  are doing.  Everyone who works in security knows that security is an arms  race.  We're glad that we were able to find this.  We always know that, you  know, our adversaries are going to get better and we're going to have to  get better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This comes as an open senate hearing is set for this morning on  social media election interference, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg herself  along with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey will both testify.  They are headed to  Capitol Hill this fall to testify in front of that same committee.  Joining  us right now to weigh in is Harvard Law professor emeritus and author of  the book \"Trumped Up: Criminalization of Political Endangers Democracy\"   Alan Dershowitz.  Alan, good to see you, as always, thanks so much for  being here.</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW:  Well, thank you so much.   You know, my new book is \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump.\"  \"Trumped  Up's\" my old book so thank you for mentioning it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you've got -- you've written a number of books, \"The Case  Against Impeaching Trump\" was your most recent.  And then, you took a look  at election interference as well.  I want to ask you about that because is  there anything you think can be done to regulate this kind of interference?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Oh, absolutely.  That's why from day one, I said we don't need  a special counsel.  We need a nonpartisan expert commission like the 9/11  commission to look into the entire issue of interference with our  elections.  Remember, what's going on with Facebook isn't criminal, so  Mueller has no jurisdiction over it, but it's very serious.  The  indictments now in the southern district of New York against lobbyists,  have nothing to do with Russian interference, but it's very serious.  We  don't need a special counsel, we need experts looking into this, and  figuring out how to make sure that foreign governments don't interfere with  our elections.  </p><p>There is a possibility of regulation consistent with the First Amendment,  but it's difficult and will require a kind of nuanced approach.  So, the  worst approach is kind of the blunderbuss approach of a special prosecutor  behind closed doors, and the best approach is what Great Britain, and  Israel, and other countries do, set up royal commissions to investigate the  problem and come up with solutions that are broad-based, that's what we  need to do with Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's not just this issue that brings these social  media executives to Washington.  It's also the fact that Congress is saying  that they are censoring conservative ideas.  Kevin McCarthy, the majority  leader, has been out aggressively saying, look, I'm noticing that you are  actually editing out or censoring conservative ideas.  We'll see what comes  out of this.  Any way to regulate any of this?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  There is a way of regulating it.  Remember that these enormous  organizations, like Facebook and Google, are almost quasi-governmental.   They have such fantastic power and can influence that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lot of influence, yes.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  A lot of influence.  First of all, it ought to start with  self-regulation, but there has to be the possibility of laws and rules  being enacted consistent with the First Amendment.  Congress has to pass  the laws but it's not the right institution to get the information, because  it's so partisan.  Having a nonpartisan expert commission, that's what we  did after 9/11.  We learned so much from that commission, we passed good  laws, good regulations, and we haven't had another 9/11.  What we're  worried about is we're going to have another 2016 in 2018.  We're seeing  that there are still efforts to interfere with our elections, we have to  stop that, and we have to do it aggressively and prospectively.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me switchgears and ask you about judicial watch now  obtaining new e-mails that it says revealed that FBI Agent Peter Strzok  insisted on retaining his security clearance before moving to special  counsel Robert Mueller's team.  How significant do you see this?  I mean,  he's had this security clearance, even as this entire investigation has  gone on into his performance.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  But he should have recused himself -- he should have accused  himself -- recused himself from day one.  He knew before anybody else knew  what his biases were?  That he was out to stop the election of Donald  Trump, that he needed an insurance policy against doing that.  When you  have somebody with those attitudes, those aren't just political  preferences, those are goals, illegal improper goals, trying to influence  the election, putting a thumb of FBI agents on the scale of the elections.   He should have recused himself, he should never, ever have been allowed to  remain in the FBI, while he himself was being investigated in this way.   This is a real problem, a real issue, and I don't think it's being  addressed sufficiently.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Alan, where do you think this goes, Peter Strzok, Andrew  McCabe, all of this abuse of power that we saw at the top, very top of the  FBI during the 2016 election.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, the one thing it doesn't happen -- it doesn't go into a  Mueller report.  Mueller is going to try to protect these guys.  That's  why, again, the I.G., the Inspector General's report was objective, and  what we needed was a nonpartisan expert commission that could look into  Strzok.  We're not going to hear much about these influences when we see  the Mueller report because Mueller has an interest in creating an illusion  of objectivity around his investigation.  And the last thing he wants to do  is expose the kind of subjectivity that he himself allowed in the  investigation by not having Strzok recuse himself.  Now, to his credit,  Mueller did take Strzok out of the investigation, as soon as he learned  about the facts, but that was way late into the game, Strzok should have  recused himself on his -- on his own, initially.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Way late.  And I think -- it sounds like what it -- what that  would be would be exactly that, an illusion, and not actually objectivity.</p><p>Meanwhile, speaking of --</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, we'll wait and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Robert Mueller, I mean, there was a report recently that he  wants to give Tony Podesta, a former lobbyist, immunity if he gives some  information about Paul Manafort.  Now, we know that the former lobbyist  Tony Podesta and former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig are reportedly  under investigation by prosecutors in New York after a referral from the  special counsel Mueller's office.  CNN first reported the probe.  Your  reaction to this?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, these are good people.  And whether they did anything  wrong should be determined, but again, it shows we didn't need a special  counsel.  The special counsel isn't investigating these guys.  The case is  in the southern district of New York.  Every one of these cases could have  been handled by a U.S. Attorney's office.  Why did we have to spend so many  millions of dollars and bring on additional staff, it's going to end up  only in a report and some low-hanging fruit indictments.  </p><p>And the way in which Mueller is proceeding, trying to squeeze Manafort,  trying to get him to testify against Trump, even Judge Ellis who's  presiding over the trial, says, this trial is not about Manafort.  It's  about trying to get Manafort to sing or compose about Donald Trump and  other higher-ups.  You know, I used to teach my students in first year, if  you're going to commit a crime in America, commit it with someone more  important than you are so you can turn them in, they can't turn you in.   That's the way the Mueller probe is operating, squeezing people at the low- end to try to get people at the high-end, and what you get often in that  situation is false testimony, composing rather than just singing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But it's also, like, a really good way to muddy the  waters because most Americans out there watching this, don't realize that  all of these charges against Paul Manafort are from years ago and have  nothing to do with the Trump campaign.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  That's right.  And the goal, however, is to get him to have to  make a choice, between dying in prison, or testifying against his former  associates.  And most people prefer to testify than die in prison, even if  it means exaggerating stories and making up stories.  That's why Judge  Ellis was so critical of the prosecution.  He didn't throw it out because  there was no legal basis in his view, but he was very critical of the  motivations of the prosecutor in going after Manafort in this way, and we  should all be critical of that.  And every civil libertarian should be  concerned that this technique can be used against you, your loved ones,  people you know, people on your side of the political spectrum.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any expectation in terms of when the Mueller investigation  comes to close, real quick?</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I think it either has to end very quickly before the  midterms or it has to wait until after the midterms.  The worst thing would  be to release a report within a month of the midterm elections.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.  Alan, good to see you this morning, as always.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, Alan Dershowitz.  And your new book, \"The Case  Against Impeaching Trump\" is available everywhere, and there it is.  Alan  Dershowitz.</p><p>Coming up, the backlash against democratic socialism, Stuart Varney weighs  in on that, coming up next.  And then, the race to $1 trillion, details as  Apple stock is on track for a record high opening this morning, will it hit  $1 trillion at market value today?  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Apple delivers its best ever revenue for the  June quarter, typically the weakest quarter of all.  Adam Shapiro on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange with those details.  Adam, good  morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  And their guidance for the next quarter, 60 to 62 billion in  revenue, so investors are very happy.  But take a look at what's going on  with just smartphone and iPhone sales, Apple reported they sold 41.3  million iPhones in the last quarter.  That was flat, but the average sale  price was much better than people had expected.  So, that's one of the  reasons they're doing so well.  </p><p>But then they faced competition, Huawei out of China, Huawei sold in the  quarter 54 million units.  They are now the second largest supplier of  smartphones in the world.  They've got a market share of 50.8 percent.   Samsung is number one, 20.9 percent.  Apple has fallen to third with 12.1  percent.  But Apple is still rocking the boat and could hit that trillion- dollar market capitalization perhaps today.  The share price that they've  got to hit to do that is somewhere around $203.45 a share, so we're going  to keep an eye on that for each day.</p><p>Also, we're going to keep an eye on Tesla.  Tesla reporting after the bell,  expected to report a loss of $2.92 but revenue is expected to jump by more  than 40 percent to $3.92 billion up from 2.79 billion a year ago.  The  other thing is that Tesla has announced they are planning to build a  factory in China, $5 billion.  And another thing we're going to watch with  Tesla, the numbers on production for Model 3, 28,578 in the second quarter.   They are shipping something like 11,000 Model 3 units, now that they're  producing 5,000 a week.  The other thing, Tesla is going to be big for  everybody, you know, something, Maria, my brother has a Tesla, says it's  the best car he's ever owned, but to put in perspective, this is a guy who  used to own a Chevy Cavalier and a Honda Civic.  So, I'm just saying.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Important analogy there.  Adam, thank you.  Adam Shapiro.   Switching gears, to the big cost of big government, a new study says that  Bernie Sanders' Medicare For All Plan would actually cost a whopping $32.6  trillion over 10 years.  The news coming as one city north of the border,  Ontario, is now scrapping a plan to provide basic guaranteed income.   Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney to weigh in  here.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Please tell Adam that I still  drive a Chrysler Town &amp; Country.  OK, well, let's get that out of the way.   Look, two of the mainstay policies suggested by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez  and Bernie Sanders, the socialist wing of the Democrat Party.  Two of the  main standby-ers are, as you mentioned, Maria, this Medicare For All $32  trillion over 10 years.  And this guaranteed minimum income, and that  program, a pilot program that's just been abandoned by the people in  Ontario, Canada.  </p><p>Those are two mainstay policies of this new socialist wing of the Democrat  Party, and those two policies are in shambles.  They're abandoning this  idea of a guaranteed minimum income, it's not sustainable, you can't afford  it.  And you certainly can't afford $32 trillion, as a way of getting you  Medicare For All for 10 years.  So, I think their policies are collapsing.   If they really wanted to help more people, just look towards capitalism and  the Trump growth agenda.  We have wages now rising at the fastest pace in  many, many years.  And in fact, their wages are rising 25 percent faster  under Trump than they were under Obama.  The economy is expanding at a four  percent growth rate, we just got 219,000 new private sector jobs --  capitalism is supplying the goodies for more people and socialism is  failing.  I just wish that the millennials could see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's pretty incredible that now we're debating whether or  not socialism works.</p><p>VARNEY:  Dear Lord, I'm a refugee from socialism for heaven's sake.  You  want to ask my opinion?  Well, you're going to get it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Stu, I know we'll see you in a few minutes, 10  minutes, then you'll have a lot more on that.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins  top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA, join  Stuart.  First though, getting into the cryptocraze, you break down the  latest on Bitcoin as the digital currency dropped seven percent overnight,  that's next.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Bitcoin tumbling again, the cryptocurrency  dropped seven percent over the last 24 hours triggering fears of bear  market, and that will continue for digital currencies.  Joining us right  now is Perianne Boring, she is the Chamber of Digital Commerce Founder and  President.  Perianne, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PERIANNE BORING, FOUND &amp; PRESIDENT, CHAMBER OF DIGITAL COMMERCE:  Thanks  for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's been a wild ride for Bitcoin.  Do you think you just  need a strong stomach for this?  Is this something we should just get used  to?</p><p>BORING:  Yes, you definitely need a strong stomach to operate in this  space.  You know, if you look at the price of Bitcoin on a day-to-day  basis, it does seem to be volatile and that's one of the biggest criticisms  people have of this digital currency.  But if you're able to zoom out and  look at this year-over-year, the price of Bitcoin on August 1, 2017 was  hovering around $2700.  So, over the past year, Bitcoin has grown about 175  percent.  So, Bitcoin is not really -- the price of Bitcoin is not the best  indicator of the innovation and the success in the ecosystem.  I would  encourage you to look at other stats like jobs created, projects underway,  new companies, companies going public, fund-raising in this space.  There's  a lot of other ways to look at and measure the success of Blockchain.</p><p>MURPHY:  Hey, Perianne, this is Mike Murphy.  You know, I see that, you  know, your Twitter handle is PerianneDC, so, you know, I wonder if the  government is ever going to get involved in the whether it'd be Bitcoin or  Blockchain or somehow, regulating this entire industry, how do you see  that?</p><p>BORING:  Well, the Chamber of Digital Commerce, we are the world's largest  trade association that's representing the Blockchain technology industry.   We're headquartered in Washington, D.C., we're still the only trade  association in D.C. that's focused on Blockchain.  And what I can tell you  is that from a government and regulatory affairs' perspective, there is a  lot underway and there are many different government agencies that are  looking to regulate this technology, we're doing a lot of work with CFTC, a  lot of work with the SEC, a lot of work with the consumer regulators.  And  there's been quite a bit of activity on Capitol Hill, and we even have a  Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  So, despite what some people may think,  that this is the Wild West or that it's completely unregulated, this is a  heavily-regulated space.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Perianne, good to have you  on the program, thanks so much.</p><p>BORING:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Perianne Boring there.  We'll be right back with some final  thoughts from this all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from this all-star panel, Morgan Ortagus.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think what Vice President Pence said yesterday about calling  out America's enemies on cybersecurity is the first time an American  official has gone on record to say we're going to be offensive, and it's a  really important policy change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  Let's watch Apple today.  I think it'd be very interesting to see  how they do and if they get to 203.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And a hundred -- and $1 trillion in value, Dagen's bet.</p><p>MURPHY:  $1 trillion.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Always focus on the stocks and the people who are  underappreciated, because they surprise you, just like Apple.</p><p>MURPHY:  Like it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  That'll do it for us.  Have a great day, everybody.   Dagen McDowell, Mike Murphy, Morgan Ortagus, we'll see you soon.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone.  Mr. Trump plays  hardball on trade.  Instead of 10 percent tariffs on Chinese products  coming here.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, June 7.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher, take a look.  But that was the high of the  morning, actually.  Futures indicating a gain of about 56 points on the Dow  Industrials; the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are up but just barely, 3 points higher on  the S&amp;P.  This after the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes closed at new  highs again yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 finished at their highest  levels in three months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe this morning, mixed performances, take a look.  It was a rough  start for London this morning.  Trading on the London stock exchange was  delayed this morning due to a technical issue.  The FT 100 is now up just  seven points.  The CAC 40 is up a fraction, a third of a percent and the  DAX index is also higher by a fraction in Germany.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, take a look, with the  exception of China which was down a fraction.</p><p>Trade tensions -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed to the White  House today ahead of the G-7 meeting this weekend.  President Trump at odds  with the other six nations in the G-7 going into the summit over the tariff  and trade policy out of this White House.</p><p>The administration's top official, Larry Kudlow, says this is not a major  fight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  I regard this as much  like a family quarrel.  I'm always the optimist.  President Trump is very  clear with respect to his trade reform efforts that we will do what is  necessary to protect the United States, its businesses and its workforce.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest on trade coming up.</p><p>Plus, a high stakes meeting on f Capitol Hill -- Republican lawmakers  coming together to try to hammer out a deal on immigration.  It comes amid  a startling new report on illegal border crossings -- 50,000 people were  arrested just last month.</p><p>An unbelievable scene in Wyoming to show you -- a powerful tornado touching  down in Wyoming.  We've got the very latest.  Look at those pictures.  Wow.</p><p>Meanwhile soaring oil prices set to cost you, airlines are now raising the  price of tickets.  The details coming up.</p><p>And a new twist on bridal bouquets, a pizza parlor now offering  arrangements made of pizza.  But how do you throw it?</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to talk  all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff Capital CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant  editorial page editor James Freeman.  Who would want to catch it if it's  all pizza?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well how about maybe just the dough where, you know, you're working on the  dough and then you toss it out to the crowd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you're in a wedding dress.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Everyone's  always wanted to do that, right.  Whenever you go in a pizza joint you  always want to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, very good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She can -- this is Maria Bartiromo's wheelhouse  that you just entered.  She can toss dough in the air.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We've seen this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Has this been a segment on the show, yet or -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did a segment on \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" with my sister when we  made my father's pizza.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We need to do that again, for sure.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it could be an annual -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More than annual. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to send a camera crew to your house, like when  you're with your family, making pizza.  It would be awesome.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll show you how to make pizza.</p><p>Look, we've got to get into the story about Iran.  You mentioned it earlier  and what went on in the Obama administration -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of allowing Iran to have access to the U.S.  financial system.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the President had said as part of his terrible nuclear  deal, don't worry -- he said this to Congress -- I'm not going to let the  Iranians into the U.S. banking system.  That's one sanction I'm not going  to remove.</p><p>Well, they figure out that if they want to give Iran access to billions of  dollars, that Iran wanted it in dollars and then to convert that to euros.   So they decided secretly to issue a license allowing Iran to transact in  the U.S. banking system.</p><p>Well, the plan failed because U.S. banks would not participate.  And I know  over the last decade especially, people have really beaten up on the big  banks.  I've been among those people.  And I think this is a time where  you've got to say hats off to bankers for -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two major banks said no, we're not doing it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And good for them to say no, we're not going to participate  in this secret deal to fund the Ayatollah.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I remember right after the Iranian nuclear deal was inked,  because of the sanctions on U.S. banks, John Kerry took a trip to I think  it was London and met with all these banking heads and all these executives  in the financial system and was trying to encourage them to do business  with Iran -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which would have been illegal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally said we've got restrictions on U.S. banks but you  guys, you can go ahead and start transacting business with Iran because  they were so desperate for the deal to work and for money to get funneled.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  The banks had regulators they had to answer to -- that's why  they couldn't do it when the President -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they knew -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The banks were afraid of breaking the law.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think we ought to give more credit -- I don't think it  was just compliance.  I think they made the right decision and they  realized the customers wouldn't like this either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a big story.  We're going to talk about this about  coming.</p><p>We've got Financial Services Committee member and Wisconsin Congressman  Sean Duffy coming up so we will ask him about that along with Ways and  Means Committee member and New York Congressman Tom Reed.  We'll see what  they think about this whole Iran situation.</p><p>Plus, Murray Energy founder and president and CEO Bob Murray has a thing or  two to say about trade and tariff as well.</p><p>So stay with us on all of that coming up.  Big hour coming up.</p><p>But first this top story and that is trade tensions.  President Trump  meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today ahead of the G-7  meeting and the President's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway is live at the White House this morning with more.   Doug -- good morning to you.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>And this marks about the start of the President's busiest week since he  assumed office.  It begins this afternoon with the visit of Japanese  President Shinzo Abe who arrives here at 12:00 noon.  The two men are  planning for a joint press conference at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>They have hit it all very well as you well know.  Shinzo Abe was the first  foreign leader to visit the Trump Tower during the transition, later  invited to Mar-A-Lago where the two men enjoyed golf.  They seemed to have  hit it off very, very well.</p><p>No country has a greater interest in reining in North Korea's nuclear  capability than Japan.  That country is truly facing an existential threat  from Kim Jong-un's ballistic missiles.  His meeting with Trump today points  out that the upcoming summit in Singapore is not really a bilateral  meeting, although it is that by name, but that the interest of many  countries -- Japan, South Korea, China, the Pacific Rim countries and many  others -- all have a very important stake in this.</p><p>Complicating the preparations for the summit is the G-7 meeting in Quebec  tomorrow which the President will attend.  It comes amid heated debate over  President Trump's pursuit of more tariffs against Canada, against Mexico,  against the European Union and the President's ban against the Japanese --  excuse me, the Chinese phone company ZTE which has been accused of evading  the ban on sanctions against Iran and North Korea.</p><p>Larry Kudlow was asked about whether there's been a consideration of  lifting the ban on ZTE yesterday.  Here's what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  No decisions on both sides as of now.  And of course, I refer you  to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce.  But as of this moment, no  decision has been reached by both sides.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Trump leaves for the G-7 summit tomorrow.  From there he will  jet off to Singapore where so much is at stake, so much is unknown, and so  many countries are awaiting eagerly to find out what happens and whether  there will be subsequent meetings at all.  </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  And we check back as news develops.  Doug -- thank  you.  Doug McKelway there -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at the White House this morning.</p><p>Facebook fallout -- Senator Ed Markey is calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to  testify before Cngress again following backlash over the social media  company's data partnership with Chinese phone maker Huawei.</p><p>Yesterday, the Senator tweeted this, \"For more than 10 years Facebook has  shared users' personal data with Chinese companies including one with close  ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  I'm calling for Mark Zuckerberg to  come to the Senate and explain how U.S. national security was not  jeopardized.\"</p><p>Here's a look back to what Zuckerberg said during his testimony on the hill  back in April.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook.  I run it.  And I'm responsible for what  happens here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg,  early investor in Facebook certainly, and managing director and co-founder  of Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee here with us.  Roger -- great to see  you.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Always  great to be here -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. </p><p>So you've previously voiced your concerns over Facebook and the business  model.  How do you feel about the response from Facebook?  Where are we now  on this issue?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We're nowhere near the end, unfortunately.  The company had this  model for years called \"move fast and break things\".  The notion was don't  let anything get in the way of growth.</p><p>The reality is it was really \"move fast, break things, apologize and then  move on\" as though nothing has happened.  And that's really where Mark is  now.  He's apologizing because every rock we turn over has another scandal  hidden underneath it.</p><p>And this one in China, we don't know exactly how bad it is.  What we know,  though, is that Facebook was not monitoring these companies.  And if the  Defense Department is telling us they won't buy Huawei products because  they're afraid of bugging and hacking, I think we have to be concerned that  Huawei with 10 years or whatever of control of Facebook user accounts is  going to have had the opportunity to download all that data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is one of the biggest stories of our time,  frankly.  When you look at China and what has occurred and the fact that  there's this massive technology transfer going on, where China acquires  American companies, forces the transfer of technology and then you see  Facebook, it's not the technology or secrets but it's all their user data.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And Mark has worked so hard to try to get in the good graces of  the Chinese government in order to have the opportunity to participate  there -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the thing though, yes.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  -- and so I do not find their response even remotely comforting,  because their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the  bare minimum when they're forced to.  And the situation here is they  weren't paying attention.  They have no idea what these guys did and they  had years to mess with this data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And there are other technology companies that wanted a  foothold in China but would not adhere to China rules, in terms of forcing  the technology.  Look at Google.</p><p>By the way, Google now reportedly bracing for a fine of up to $11 billion  following an anti-trust issue in the European Union.  That of course,  investigation into the company according to the \"Financial Times\" is coming  to a head.  This would be the second major penalty for Google coming from  the European competition regulators.</p><p>What's going on in terms of regulation within tech?  We're just at the  beginning of this.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We are.  And it's really important that we have some threat of  regulation because the companies have done a terrible job of self- regulation.  I mean, they have been given all the room in the world to  manage themselves and yet we've clearly seen one disaster after another.</p><p>And the issues that Google faces in Europe are not unique to Google.   Amazon has competitive issues in many markets around the world.  Facebook  is clearly behaving like a monopolist around the world.  And as a  consequence, regulators I think are appropriately worried that the  entrepreneurial economy, especially in this country, is being stifled.</p><p>These guys are blocking the new startups from getting going.  They're  really limiting the rate of innovation in this country.  And that's not the  American way.  The American way is we let a thousand flowers bloom.  We let  entrepreneur create new things.</p><p>And these guys can be really successful without blocking every new thing  that comes along.  And it's important for regulators to make that point and  find ways to constrain them so that we can have this kind of economy that  really supports jobs all across America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are there other companies out there that are also selling the  data right now that we don't even know about?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I assume so.  In fact, I think you have to assume that whatever  data you had that was in one of these systems has been compromised  somewhere.  The only company that has made a strategy of protecting your  data is Apple and even there I don't think you can feel 100 percent safe.   But you're going to feel much safer there.</p><p>The worst offenders on this have been the Android operating system that  Google owns and Facebook.  Both of which have been so porous that frankly,  you just have to assume everything has been compromised.</p><p>And so that's why when regulators look at this, the important thing to look  at is to protect users from inappropriate usage of their data going forward  -- there's no way to get the data back.  So what you have to do is place  restrictions on how it's used.  We have to be given control over what any  company does with the data that they have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's that.  There's also the issue of conservative ideas  being crushed, being, you know, eliminated.  So we had Kevin McCarthy on  the show recently, the majority leader, he said that.  That, you know,  these companies are editing the information that we all see.  We had Devin  Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee Sunday who said the same thing.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  There's no question that they edit like crazy.  But I think the  perception they edit one side more than the other is not actually correct.   I think what's going on is that these companies are not transparent.  We  have no idea what they're doing when they edit.</p><p>I think in reality, what they're doing is creating what is known as a  filter bubble around each person.  They give each person what that person  wants and their idea of what that person wants may or may not be correct.   But their notion is they give you your preferences all the time and  reinforce that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you saw the story last week where if you typed in GOP in  California, you pulled up a list of ideologies on Google and one of them  was Nazism.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  No, no, no.  That kind of stuff is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How does that happen -- Roger?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  The answer is this stuff is totally automated and these people  have no idea, right.  They're trying to sell ads.  They're not worried  about truth.  They're not worried about fact.  They're worried about  engagement.  They're worried about their revenue.  They want to give you  what they think you want.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now they can be worried -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  They obviously thought somebody wanted to know the party  sentiment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now they're going to have to worry about regulation.  I mean  Devin Nunes said look -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  They should have to worry about regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if somebody doesn't come in the free market and do what  Google does and make sure to promise us that they're not going to be  editing things like this, then it's fine.  If not, we're going to have to  look at this as if they're monopolies.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  You have to look that way.  Now, I think it's about time people  started to look at them that way.  The right answer in the short run is to  force them to have a button at the top that gives you a choice of view.   You can give me what you think I want.  But I want to be able to see an  unfiltered view as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick -- would you put money into this sector today?  Do  you want to buy any of these stocks?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I don't want to buy any of them.  I own -- I still own some  Facebook, I still own Apple, I still own Amazon.  I would not -- I think  we're very late in the market cycle.  I think rates are still rising.   There's a lot of uncertainty on global trade and the tech industry's really  sensitive to global trade.</p><p>So I think it looks good relative to the market but I'm nervous about the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are so good.  How's the band going?  Moonalice?</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Awesome -- playing a lot of rock and roll.  It's summertime.   Moonalice.com for anybody who wants to check it out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are my rock and roll mentor.  Roger -- good to see you.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Always great to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roger McNamee.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  welcome back.</p><p>Las Vegas police releasing 9-1-1 calls from the deadliest mass shooting in  modern U.S. history.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They're tough to listen to -- Maria.</p><p>You hear things like panic, you hear fear, you hear the desperation in  these voices; as you said, Las Vegas police releasing these 9-1-1 calls  eight months after the mass shooting.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My friend just got shot.  We need an ambulance.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have three gunshot wounds and I have no idea where  we re.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You need an ambulance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And there's so many calls to listen to, folks.  Authorities also  releasing this video from surveillance cameras that show people frantically  fleeing the scene.  The gunfire came from the 32nd floor windows of the  Mandalay Bay Resort; 58 people were killed that night.</p><p>Well, incredible video of a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming last  night.  The National Weather Service said the tornado was on the ground for  at least 45 minutes.  Some brave people heading outside, snapping photos of  the monstrous twister -- brave or maybe just crazy, I don't know.</p><p>You can see the massive thunderstorm that sparked the tornado hovering  above.  No word yet if there was any damage or injuries but incredible  pictures.</p><p>Well, a more than 50 percent jump in fuel cost is hitting air travelers  right in the wallet as airlines start to raise their fares.  Delta Airlines  cutting its profit forecast for the year, adding it could take anywhere  from six months to a year to make up for increase fuel costs.  United  Airlines also expected to raise ticket prices very soon.  Shares of Delta  Airlines are down about 3 percent this year.  United Continental up about 4  percent.</p><p>Ok, here's something a little more fun.  For a bride to chew on as she  walks down the aisle, who doesn't want this?  Via Italian Kitchen  announcing this week couples tying the knot this summer could enter to win  an exclusive pizza bouquet and they get a boutonniere.</p><p>They claim it's going to be the first ever of its kind.  I think that's  true.  Entries have to be in by June 15th.  Win or lose, entrants will  receive a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  But for the pizza-loving  bride, Maria -- hey, why not girls do it.  Go for it.  Fully support it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>Coming up -- the battle over immigration.  House Republicans meet for  crucial negotiations today on border control, just as a startling new  report says illegal border crossings had hit 50,000 in the month of May.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The GOP getting ready for a crucial debate on immigration later today;  there are stark divisions within the Republican conference.  This, as the  DHS Reports that border arrests have exceeded 50,000 just for the month of  May.  And this is the third month in a row that they've exceeded 50,000.</p><p>Here now, Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York, a member of the  House Ways and Means Committee, who has signed a discharge petition which  could force votes on immigration.  Congressman -- good to see you, Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Thanks for having me  on -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you do that?  You need to force a decision on  immigration because it's so in the background at this point.  </p><p>REED:  This has been going on for months.  This is now seven months into  this issue of resolving it, not just for the Dreamers and these kids that  are caught up in a broken immigration system, but more fundamentally to  secure our borders and get this wall and structures constructed to secure  the border so we're starting to fix the problem.</p><p>And this discharge petition is just going to have an open debate on four  bills that will say let's go on record, put the position of the House out  there so that we can then go with the senate and see if we can get to the  White House to sign this and start legislating for the people back home.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Congressman -- the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark  Meadows sounded hopeful on the debate.  Here's what he said yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS:  We're still not in a  situation where there's an agreement.  I think there is great progress  that's being made.  Hopefully what we'll see is the objections get smaller  and less of hurdle in the hours to come.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are the hurdles -- Congressman?  Because, you know, at  the same time, you also hear Mitch McConnell saying this is never getting  anywhere before the midterm elections.  </p><p>REED:  Well, I'm glad to hear that type of conversation.  And I think this  petition is forcing and leveraging the pressure that is necessary to  finally say let's get this done.  And some of the issues that are out there  is what is the path for potential citizenship for the Dreamers, how much  money will go into the wall?  How much money will go into technology?  But  those are issues that we can work out and should have worked out months  ago.  But now we're getting to the point where it will get resolved because  they have no other option because the clock is ticking.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me switch gears here because we're waiting on the IG  report.  Jim Comey apparently defied authority when he was the FBI  director.  That's what we understand is in the IG report.  Does this chip  away at credibility there?  What are you expecting in terms of the  inspector general report which is forthcoming -- we expect this week.  </p><p>REED:  Well, first of all, absolutely it chips away at Mr. Comey's  credibility.  And remember who the IG is.  This is essentially the internal  affairs, the police of the police if you would, whose job is not to conduct  a political investigation but to hold accountable our government officials  such as James Comey to say look, I'm going to call balls and strikes here.</p><p>And that they are clearly saying and the information I'm hearing is  troublesome.  You acted insubordinate, in an insubordinate manner.  And at  the end of the day, when you have your FBI director doing that, we should  learn from it, we should hold people accountable and move forward in a  stronger fashion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman -- hi, James Freeman with the \"Wall Street Journal\".   We've been talking about the revelations this week that in order to  facilitate the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama secretly sought to give  Iran the ability to transact through the American financial system in order  to get frozen assets converted into dollars and then euros.</p><p>Does this -- does this change the politics in terms of how people on  Capitol Hill view the President's decision to abandon that deal?  Or is  this kind of a partisan rut where it doesn't have much impact?  </p><p>REED:  I hope it does.  But it definitely illustrates what I've been saying  all along about the Iranian deal.  That was, President Obama's  administration saying they were out of time, they needed to cut a deal,  they wanted to put this win up on the board.  And they were willing to  negotiate everything away in order to get the Iranian deal signed into law  in my humble opinion.</p><p>And this is yet just another sign of how they were doing that and trying to  move the ball for political deadlines rather than what we should be  focusing on, is substance of a deal that is going to keep nuclear weapons  out of the hands of Iranians.</p><p>And now what has happened is the President has gone forward in a leadership  role to say we're going to hold these guys accountable.  We're not going to  honor a deal that was done in a hasty manner in order to achieve some type  of deadline because they were leaving the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for those banks to push back and say we're not going do  it.  </p><p>REED:  Amen.  Thank God they did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want -- I want to add one thing, Congressman -- in terms  of it was almost as if American banks and even businesses knew that this  was a bad deal from the start.  </p><p>REED:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And would not step up because, again, you had just myriad  businesses in Europe immediately beginning to transact business with Iran  after this deal was done, oh so anxiously going into that country.  You did  not have that in the United States.</p><p>Boeing is kind of one of the only examples that we can cite of inking a  deal with Iran.  So it wasn't just the banks.  It was scores of other  companies.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's a great point.  And this is why we have a process for  treaties where people in this country, people overseas -- they understand  it's a real agreement.  The United States has made a decision.</p><p>President Obama didn't do that.  He basically got around the need for a  treaty.  They had this cheap maneuver in the Congress -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For the U.N.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, good for American businesses and banks in this case saying  this isn't going to fly and it won't fly with our customer.  </p><p>REED:  And if I could add, a great point, and that is why when President  Trump did this with the Iranian deal, it squarely is going to put American  businesses as well as European businesses, who are you going to side with?   The Iranians or America?</p><p>And that is going to be further leveraged to say I know where people will  want to do business. That's with us as proud Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- real quick before you go.  Are you going to do  phase two of the tax cut plan before the midterms?  </p><p>REED:  We're definitely moving forward on the committee.  We're drafting  that.  We're working on it, having conversations.  And we want to do it.   We want to protect those individuals and make this code permanent for  individuals as well as the expensing provisions for businesses across the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think that will be something we'll see before the  midterms?  </p><p>REED:  I do believe so.  We're on track to get that done and that's exactly  where I think we're going to land.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you sir.  Thank you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks for having us on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Reed joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the power of big tech -- the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 hitting  record highs, boosted by the technology sector.  We're taking at look at  how long this rally can last. </p><p>Then bottoms up at Wal-Mart -- the retailer going upscale with wine at  bargain prices.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  It is Thursday, June 7th.  Your top  stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>It is looking like a mixed picture for markets at the opening of trading  this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a gain of 70 points on the  Dow Jones Industrial average.  This right here, this is the high of the  morning, Dow industrials up 70, S&amp;P and NASDAQ are up just a fraction.  But  it is -- the Dow that's really going to be the splash.  Yesterday it was a  record-breaker for the NASDAQ and the Russell meanwhile.  The Russell 2000  Index and the NASDAQ hitting all-time highs while the Dow and S&amp;P 500  closed the day at their highest levels in three months.  Take a look at  those numbers, pretty strong performance.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story.  London's trading day got off to a  late start.  The market got hit by a rare technical glitch delaying the  open.  The FT-100 is up 20 points right now, the CAC Quarante and DAX index  are higher by a quarter of a percent at this hour.  </p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher as you can see there, with  the exception of China.  Shang Hai Composite was down a fraction.  </p><p>Coming up, more Americans banking on the big inheritance (INAUDIBLE) to  secure their future.  We'll take a look at this trend and how we're  investing it.</p><p>Starbucks customers, getting awakening this morning.  A cup of coffee just  got more expensive.  How much it is going to cost you for your cup of Joe  every morning now?  </p><p>Jessica Alba wants to take her Honest Company global.  The consumer goods  company just got the big bucks to back it up.  We've got the details.</p><p>And why Wal-Mart's bargain thirsty shoppers will soon be drinking up wine  at a discount.  </p><p>Plus this, lady gaga hitting the stage in the first trailer for the highly  anticipated \"A Star is Born.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LADY GAGA, SINGER AND ACTRESS, AS ALLY:  No, I can't do that.  </p><p>BRADLEY COOPER, ACTOR, AS JACKSON MAINE:  You're coming, here we go.  </p><p>GAGA:  Jack, Jack, please, it's not funny.  Jack.</p><p>COOPER:  Look at me.  All you got to do is trust me.  That's all you got to  do. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sneak peek, already sparking Oscar buzz online.  We've  got more for you coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, big tech continues to power  the markets.  The NASDAQ, the Russell 2000 index hitting at record highs  and the S&amp;P is not far behind.  Joining us right now is the chief  investment officer at Federated Investors, who just throw in there $15  billion in (INAUDIBLE) management, Stephen Auth is with us.  Stephen, good  to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're fully invested here.  </p><p>AUTH:  Well, pretty close.  Yes, we think that the market's heading higher.   The consensus I -- the consensus really is that we're going to roll over as  we approach the peak from back in early January and I think people think  we're late cycle.  Market's expensive.  We think we're not late cycle.  We  don't think the market's expensive.  And we're heading into an earnings  season, probably going to be the best earnings season in almost a decade.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We just came off of a great earnings season.  26 percent profit  growth.</p><p>AUTH:  We did.  And this one's even going to be better.  You know, earnings  will be up about 20 percent.  And we're only weeks away now.  And I think  that's the next focus on the market.  I think when once we power through  the January highs, you know, technically you could have the market head  considerably higher.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Steve, you pointed out that a lot of people are not bullish  this market, you know, they're giving a lot of reasons why the market  should roll over here.  And having been through 2000 and been through 2008,  but prior to those two periods you had everybody sell your house, invest in  the market.</p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Everybody was uber bullish.  Whereas now, I feel the consensus is  very negative which I think is a great opportunity for the market because  the earnings are really showing real growth in certain sectors.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, it's really funny, we've got this great fundamental backdrop,  yet the overall consensus is very cautious.  I put out a piece a couple of  weeks, I called the five myths.  And to me, you know, talking a lot to  investors, there's this belief that what goes up must come down, that we're  late cycle.  That the market's over expensive.  And it's just, we're not.   We're not late cycle.  If you look at where we are.  The expansion -- the  average expansion in this cycle per year is about 2.1 percent.  Whereas  most economic expansions would be more than double that.  You could argue - - you know, in time it's been long.  But in distance it hasn't been.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the age of it, like we're on our tenth year right now.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, people are worried about the age.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why we're bringing it up, that's what skeptics bring up.  </p><p>AUTH:  I think age is potentially a good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Age is just a number.  Come on. </p><p>AUTH:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Whatever you are is the new 30.  30 I'm wondering with the --  with the stocks, you're saying they're not expensive.  So, I thin  traditional analysis, you look at trailing earnings and you say, wow,  that's expensive.  You look at forward earnings it looks kind of  reasonable.  </p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is there a specific yardstick you use to say stocks are cheap,  stocks are not cheap? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, our yardstick is we look forward.  We try to analyze the  fundamentals of where we're heading.  And people have been saying this  market's expensive all the way up and it's mostly because they're looking  at trailing numbers.  But on a -- on a forward basis, this market is not  expensive.  And on individual stocks it's not expensive.  I mean, some of  the stocks we like, you mentioned some of the tech stocks, like Facebook as  an example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You like that?  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, stock's trading in, 24 times next year's earnings.  That's not  expensive.  Particularly with the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not compared to Amazon.  </p><p>AUTH:  Probably understated, yes, not compared to Amazon, Apple's 16 times,  J.P. Morgan stock we like, it's trading at 13 times.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Wait, why do you say Facebook's earnings are understated? What  does that mean? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, if you look at the traditional accounting in this country,  based on widget production basically, right?  So, when you invest in a  factory, you get to expense that over two decades.  But if you're investing  in tech and data, its immediate expensed.  But there's assets on the  balance sheets of companies like Facebook that are not even on the --  they're off-balance sheet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well they're not monetizing WhatsApp, they're not monetizing  the Messenger.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, all this data has enormous value.  And it's not showing up on  the balance sheets, they're already been expensed and in fact the  acquisition of it hasn't been.  So, you know, if you look on a cash flow  basis, these companies are generating enormous amounts of cash flow.  </p><p>MURPHY:  How much harder is your job right now?  Because the velocity of  change, with new technology coming out, you know, you have a company going  from a start-up, early stage company to a multibillion dollar company in a  couple of years.  Does that make your job and analyzing and valuing these  companies that much harder?</p><p>AUTH:  I think in general investing in stocks has become more and more  difficult.  At the same time, more and more investors have just gone  passive and that's what creates the great opportunity for the active  manager and active managers have now been outperforming the last 12 to 18  months.  There's so much money in the market that just -- is blindly  investing.  In some ways, it makes our job a little bit easier in effect.   But yes, I mean, is the complexity high? That's what you're exploring on  the show every morning.  It's gotten more and more complex.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  It is a complex world.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But even looking back 10 years, are investors still shaken from  the financial crisis and overinvested in fixed income, thinking that fixed  income, particularly treasuries -- longer term treasuries are some sort of  haven, is that the real concern here? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're staring at a bear market for something, right?</p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's either, it's going to be equities or -- </p><p>AUTH:  I mean, you're half full, half empty.  But I would say that the half  full element here and one of our thesis for what we call the secular bull.   We think we're in this long cycle secular bull is just that, the base of  this expansion is the worst economic crisis since really the great  depression and every economic actor out there has been negatively affected  by this and they all think sooner or later it's going to roll over.  Even  the regulators.  So they've been very kind to this market as a result.  So  when everyone's expecting something to happen, that's usually doesn't  happen.  And that's why stocks we think are still undervalued.  Is there a  bubble in bonds? We're not a believer of that.  We think bond yields are  low for a reason and we think they're going to grind higher but we only  anticipate -- and certainly if we had a big selloff in bonds, that would  hurt equities for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, the Federal Reserve meeting next week,  you're expecting the Fed to raise interest rates?  </p><p>AUTH:  Well, me and everyone else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And everybody else?</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Let's just talk about this for a second, during the break  we were talking about and noticing some of this price increases, the price  of coffee, Starbucks coffee's going up, airline tickets are going up.  What  else did we say? </p><p>MUROHY:  Gas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gasoline prices are going up.  Is inflation an issue?  How does  the Fed deal with that?  And what does the markets do as rates starts going  higher? </p><p>AUTH:  So, some things are going up.  But there's a lot of stuff not going  up.  Price of diapers isn't going up.  Most staples the prices are not  going up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>AUTH:  But there's not a lot of pricing power.  And you've got the Amazon  effect out there, literally with the Gatling gun on top of the mountain  top, waiting for anyone to volunteer there here (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right -- you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I'll throw it at you this way.  Maybe consumers aren't  getting those price increases passed along, that inflation, but it is  hitting businesses.  Steel prices even before these tariffs go into effect  are up 40 percent in the United States year-to-date or were through the end  of last week, even more year over year.  You have freight costs going up  and Cisco, the food company is saying our costs have gone up.  We can't  pass them under our customers.  That hits profit margins.  So, is that a  concern if you own stocks?  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, Dagen, we're about to produce a 20 percent year over year  quarterly gains in earnings in the upcoming quarter.  So yes, cost  pressures are affecting some companies and active investors like us, we're  very carefully watching which companies don't have enough pricing power or  aren't.  But there's other ways to offset commodity price increases as you  get productivity.  You get a corporate tax cut and maybe you use some of  that money to pay your workers a little --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the trade issue?  Are you worried about the trade  issue, aluminum and steel tariffs, China fight?  </p><p>AUTH:  No.  We're trying to get free and fair trade.  I mean, you've been  talking about this on the show.  But we just see that as a powerful  negotiation.  The president has most of the cards.  He's a very good  negotiator.  And you go into China, the good cops go in there, Kudlow and - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mnuchin.</p><p>AUTH:  Mnuchin, right?  And they say look, here's the deal.  You guys are  shipping $500 billion to us a year.  We're shipping you 120.  We want that  number to change.  You've got to take down some of your barriers so we can  ship more to you.  Give us $200 billion or the bad cops are going to be  over here, Navarro, etcetera.  That's what's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, you know what?  I'm so glad you're here.  Because this  was the top of our show.  This was the first words we said.  Dagen brought  this up at the top of the show saying, why we're all worried about all this  trade stuff and look at the markets new record highs.  This is why.   Stephen Auth just told us the sentiments of Wall Street.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.  You think this is all a negotiation.   You just want a better trade deal.  </p><p>AUTH:  And you know, a month ago we were talking about do the Chinese cheat  or not?  Now we're talking about how much is it?  You know, we're up to $80  billion, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AUTH:  Well OK, that's not going to work.  But we'll carry, the bid ask is  now 8200.  I couldn't find a number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the last time I check, $300 billion cost, to the theft of  intellectual property a year? </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're saying basically you think these larger problems are going  to be pushed aside.  I don't think this is progress that the government  says we're now going to set numbers for imports and exports.  Is it? </p><p>AUTH:  Look, to me the press is hysterical about this and if you think  about it, all the president wants is free and fair trade.  The tariffs is a  cajole he's using to negotiate better terms.   BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>AUTH:  The rest of the world, we're dealing with an entitlement here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  Even our so-called allies in Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AUTH:  We rebuilt the world after World War II.  We gave them all these  deals.  And now we're saying end of the entitlements.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yesterday Kudlow called the tariffs a tool.  There you go.</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, good to see you.  </p><p>AUTH:  Likewise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Stephen Auth joining us, Federated  Investors.</p><p>Coming up, get ready to pay more for your coffee.  You just heard it.   Starbucks is raising prices again.  We'll tell you how much.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  welcome back.  Starbucks hiking the cost of your morning cup of  coffee again.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  OK, this is going to get expensive, Maria.  Starbucks fans are  going to have to dig a bit deeper for the cup of Joe in the morning.  The  company raising prices between $00.10 and $00.20 on all sizes of its brewed  coffee in most of its stores here in the U.S.  Starbucks blaming the move  on the nine percent increase in operating expenses for the first half of  its fiscal year.  That's compared to last year.  Starbucks shares are down  less than one percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Jessica Alba's Honest Company receiving a fresh round of funding.   The company is getting a $200 million investment from private equity firm L  Catterton.  The Honest says, that the new investment is going to help  expand its business globally, increase product supply and funds of  innovation.  The company has not disclosed the size of the stake that L  Catterton is actually going to receive in all of this.  </p><p>Well, bargain hunters can now grab a fancy bottle of wine at Wal-Mart.  The  company trying to appeal to more upscale tastes, launching its own wine  label called Wine Makers Selection.  Customers are going to be able to buy  10 fine wines from California, France and Italy.  Retailing for about  $11.00 a bottle.  The retailer says the wine will be higher quality than  other brands of wine that it actually currently sells.  This puts them of  course in direct competition with their rival Costco.  Costco's got its own  private wine label.  Shares of Wal-Mart down 14 percent this year.  Costco  shares are up six percent.  </p><p>And then I'm so excited about this, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are  teaming up for the fourth rendition of a \"Star Is Born\" and Oscar buzz is  already swirling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOPER:  Do you write songs or anything? </p><p>GAGA:  I don't sing my own songs.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why? </p><p>GAGA:  I just don't feel comfortable.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why wouldn't you feel comfortable? </p><p>GAGA:  Almost every single person has told me they like the way I sound,  but they don't like the way I look.  </p><p>COOPER:  I think you're beautiful.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Bradley Cooper is directing Lady Gaga's feature debut as a  Hollywood lead.  Cooper plays an aging performer who takes a shy, talented  young singer played of course by, Lady Gaga.  Under his wing, she of course  brings her musical expertise to the film.  There's a slew of original songs  for this one.  She wrote a handful of them with Cooper and other artists  like Mark Ronson and Willie Nelson's son, Lukas.  \"A Star is Born\" hits  theaters October 5th.  I was actually looking at the trailer last night.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow that really does look good.  I'm looking forward to it too.  </p><p>CASONE:  Her songs are incredible on this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, she's going to be compared to Janet Gaynor,  Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand who all played this role.  So, that's  what she will be compared to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, you're saying --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  High expectation.  Coming up, windfall as the pathway to  wealth, we'll tell you why a third of Americans are banking on an  inheritance to shore up their financial futures.  Are you one of them,  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans are relying on their parents for  money, that's according to a new report from Merrill Edge that finds one in  three Americans are relying on an inheritance for financial stability.   Joining us right now in a FOX Business Exclusive is Bank of America Merrill  Edge head Aron Levine.  Good to see you, Aron.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>ARON LEVINE, MERRILL EDGE HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA:  Hey, good to see you  again.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this survey finds that number jumping to 63 percent.</p><p>LEVINE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When narrowed down between generation z or those aged between  18 and 22.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Yes, you think about that 18 to 22, that youngest generation is  facing three really serious challenges, right?  One, student debt.  It's  now up to $1.5 trillion.  29 percent increase in just the last four years.   All right, that's one huge one.  Second one, it is a fact that their  parents are living longer, they have a perception they're going to live  longer.  So now, I'm thinking about what if I live in to my 80s or 90s.   And how do I finance that?  Over the course of time.  And third is, they  are now at point now where they're starting college and thinking about well  I need to save for a home someday.  I have always competing priorities.   So, when you take in those three things, student debt, longevity and  competing priorities, they're saying, boy, I hope I get some inheritance to  solve this problem.  Because I'm really not sure how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since, I know an 18-year-old is not thinking  about their retirement.  But they're not getting Social Security, today's  18-year-old, I don't think, now that we know that the Social Security going  to be dipping into its trust fund for the first time in 36 years.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Right. Yes.  So, it's really creating a new normal in a lot of  ways.  In terms of how to redefine retirement.  I think we talked about the  last time I was on, if you're in your young 20s, you're not sincerely  saying at 65 I'm going to have this pot of money and I'm just going to get  out of the workforce.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVINE:  I think there's a clear view that says, you know, I may continue  working, hopefully it's not in the same job I'm in and I have some  financial freedom.  But the question is, how do I finance that over the  course of time versus some lump sum I have to have by a certain age?  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, Aron, one thing I see as a big change in the landscape, this  would be access that the younger generation has to information, it's  education.  I think 18 to 22-year-olds today are starting to learn more and  focus more about their money, about retirement, about what they're going to  need.  And I think that's a huge benefit to the entire country.  </p><p>LEVINE:  You're absolutely right.  So, I think all those fears that I sort  of talked about, that the upside is they're very self-aware and they are  actually taking advantage of the access.  So they go online, they're  starting to educate themselves.  And it's our job, places like Merrill Edge  and Bank of America to provide that education access and then say, what  would you like to do about it?  And I think what you're seeing is, that's  leading towards where this generation has a kind of profits and purpose  mindset.  So if I'm going to invest my money, I want to invest in something  that's a little more socially conscious.  And that's why it's important  that all of the industry is delivering those kinds of investment vehicles  so that generation can say boy, I do want to invest.  I'd love to invest in  a company that has a certain sort of moral compass.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And so, when you advise Generation Z, step one, do you say OK,  your parents by the way are going to live maybe to 100 and by the way,  we're looking at the finances of Social Security and Medicare, you're  probably on your own.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Yes, I think the -- hopefully not in your -- on one ways you're  not on your own, as you can get some advice and there are ways to reach  out.  I think what we're trying to do is say, one, you're your self- educated and focus on a plan.  Like anything, like, you can't just do it  without a very clear plan.  So that's what we key on is getting them a life  plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you.  Good to see you.  Aron Levine, Bank of  America.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Thursday, June 7th.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, June 7.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher, take a look.  But that was the high of the  morning, actually.  Futures indicating a gain of about 56 points on the Dow  Industrials; the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are up but just barely, 3 points higher on  the S&amp;P.  This after the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes closed at new  highs again yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 finished at their highest  levels in three months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe this morning, mixed performances, take a look.  It was a rough  start for London this morning.  Trading on the London stock exchange was  delayed this morning due to a technical issue.  The FT 100 is now up just  seven points.  The CAC 40 is up a fraction, a third of a percent and the  DAX index is also higher by a fraction in Germany.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, take a look, with the  exception of China which was down a fraction.</p><p>Trade tensions -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed to the White  House today ahead of the G-7 meeting this weekend.  President Trump at odds  with the other six nations in the G-7 going into the summit over the tariff  and trade policy out of this White House.</p><p>The administration's top official, Larry Kudlow, says this is not a major  fight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  I regard this as much  like a family quarrel.  I'm always the optimist.  President Trump is very  clear with respect to his trade reform efforts that we will do what is  necessary to protect the United States, its businesses and its workforce.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest on trade coming up.</p><p>Plus, a high stakes meeting on f Capitol Hill -- Republican lawmakers  coming together to try to hammer out a deal on immigration.  It comes amid  a startling new report on illegal border crossings -- 50,000 people were  arrested just last month.</p><p>An unbelievable scene in Wyoming to show you -- a powerful tornado touching  down in Wyoming.  We've got the very latest.  Look at those pictures.  Wow.</p><p>Meanwhile soaring oil prices set to cost you, airlines are now raising the  price of tickets.  The details coming up.</p><p>And a new twist on bridal bouquets, a pizza parlor now offering  arrangements made of pizza.  But how do you throw it?</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to talk  all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff Capital CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant  editorial page editor James Freeman.  Who would want to catch it if it's  all pizza?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well how about maybe just the dough where, you know, you're working on the  dough and then you toss it out to the crowd.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you're in a wedding dress.  </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Everyone's  always wanted to do that, right.  Whenever you go in a pizza joint you  always want to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Oh, very good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She can -- this is Maria Bartiromo's wheelhouse  that you just entered.  She can toss dough in the air.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We've seen this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Has this been a segment on the show, yet or -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did a segment on \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" with my sister when we  made my father's pizza.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We need to do that again, for sure.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it could be an annual -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  More than annual. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to send a camera crew to your house, like when  you're with your family, making pizza.  It would be awesome.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll show you how to make pizza.</p><p>Look, we've got to get into the story about Iran.  You mentioned it earlier  and what went on in the Obama administration -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of allowing Iran to have access to the U.S.  financial system.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the President had said as part of his terrible nuclear  deal, don't worry -- he said this to Congress -- I'm not going to let the  Iranians into the U.S. banking system.  That's one sanction I'm not going  to remove.</p><p>Well, they figure out that if they want to give Iran access to billions of  dollars, that Iran wanted it in dollars and then to convert that to euros.   So they decided secretly to issue a license allowing Iran to transact in  the U.S. banking system.</p><p>Well, the plan failed because U.S. banks would not participate.  And I know  over the last decade especially, people have really beaten up on the big  banks.  I've been among those people.  And I think this is a time where  you've got to say hats off to bankers for -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two major banks said no, we're not doing it.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And good for them to say no, we're not going to participate  in this secret deal to fund the Ayatollah.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I remember right after the Iranian nuclear deal was inked,  because of the sanctions on U.S. banks, John Kerry took a trip to I think  it was London and met with all these banking heads and all these executives  in the financial system and was trying to encourage them to do business  with Iran -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which would have been illegal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- literally said we've got restrictions on U.S. banks but you  guys, you can go ahead and start transacting business with Iran because  they were so desperate for the deal to work and for money to get funneled.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  The banks had regulators they had to answer to -- that's why  they couldn't do it when the President -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they knew -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The banks were afraid of breaking the law.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think we ought to give more credit -- I don't think it  was just compliance.  I think they made the right decision and they  realized the customers wouldn't like this either.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is a big story.  We're going to talk about this about  coming.</p><p>We've got Financial Services Committee member and Wisconsin Congressman  Sean Duffy coming up so we will ask him about that along with Ways and  Means Committee member and New York Congressman Tom Reed.  We'll see what  they think about this whole Iran situation.</p><p>Plus, Murray Energy founder and president and CEO Bob Murray has a thing or  two to say about trade and tariff as well.</p><p>So stay with us on all of that coming up.  Big hour coming up.</p><p>But first this top story and that is trade tensions.  President Trump  meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today ahead of the G-7  meeting and the President's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway is live at the White House this morning with more.   Doug -- good morning to you.  </p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>And this marks about the start of the President's busiest week since he  assumed office.  It begins this afternoon with the visit of Japanese  President Shinzo Abe who arrives here at 12:00 noon.  The two men are  planning for a joint press conference at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>They have hit it all very well as you well know.  Shinzo Abe was the first  foreign leader to visit the Trump Tower during the transition, later  invited to Mar-A-Lago where the two men enjoyed golf.  They seemed to have  hit it off very, very well.</p><p>No country has a greater interest in reining in North Korea's nuclear  capability than Japan.  That country is truly facing an existential threat  from Kim Jong-un's ballistic missiles.  His meeting with Trump today points  out that the upcoming summit in Singapore is not really a bilateral  meeting, although it is that by name, but that the interest of many  countries -- Japan, South Korea, China, the Pacific Rim countries and many  others -- all have a very important stake in this.</p><p>Complicating the preparations for the summit is the G-7 meeting in Quebec  tomorrow which the President will attend.  It comes amid heated debate over  President Trump's pursuit of more tariffs against Canada, against Mexico,  against the European Union and the President's ban against the Japanese --  excuse me, the Chinese phone company ZTE which has been accused of evading  the ban on sanctions against Iran and North Korea.</p><p>Larry Kudlow was asked about whether there's been a consideration of  lifting the ban on ZTE yesterday.  Here's what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW:  No decisions on both sides as of now.  And of course, I refer you  to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce.  But as of this moment, no  decision has been reached by both sides.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Trump leaves for the G-7 summit tomorrow.  From there he will  jet off to Singapore where so much is at stake, so much is unknown, and so  many countries are awaiting eagerly to find out what happens and whether  there will be subsequent meetings at all.  </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  And we check back as news develops.  Doug -- thank  you.  Doug McKelway there -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at the White House this morning.</p><p>Facebook fallout -- Senator Ed Markey is calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to  testify before Cngress again following backlash over the social media  company's data partnership with Chinese phone maker Huawei.</p><p>Yesterday, the Senator tweeted this, \"For more than 10 years Facebook has  shared users' personal data with Chinese companies including one with close  ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  I'm calling for Mark Zuckerberg to  come to the Senate and explain how U.S. national security was not  jeopardized.\"</p><p>Here's a look back to what Zuckerberg said during his testimony on the hill  back in April.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook.  I run it.  And I'm responsible for what  happens here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg,  early investor in Facebook certainly, and managing director and co-founder  of Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee here with us.  Roger -- great to see  you.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Always  great to be here -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. </p><p>So you've previously voiced your concerns over Facebook and the business  model.  How do you feel about the response from Facebook?  Where are we now  on this issue?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We're nowhere near the end, unfortunately.  The company had this  model for years called \"move fast and break things\".  The notion was don't  let anything get in the way of growth.</p><p>The reality is it was really \"move fast, break things, apologize and then  move on\" as though nothing has happened.  And that's really where Mark is  now.  He's apologizing because every rock we turn over has another scandal  hidden underneath it.</p><p>And this one in China, we don't know exactly how bad it is.  What we know,  though, is that Facebook was not monitoring these companies.  And if the  Defense Department is telling us they won't buy Huawei products because  they're afraid of bugging and hacking, I think we have to be concerned that  Huawei with 10 years or whatever of control of Facebook user accounts is  going to have had the opportunity to download all that data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is one of the biggest stories of our time,  frankly.  When you look at China and what has occurred and the fact that  there's this massive technology transfer going on, where China acquires  American companies, forces the transfer of technology and then you see  Facebook, it's not the technology or secrets but it's all their user data.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  And Mark has worked so hard to try to get in the good graces of  the Chinese government in order to have the opportunity to participate  there -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the thing though, yes.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  -- and so I do not find their response even remotely comforting,  because their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the  bare minimum when they're forced to.  And the situation here is they  weren't paying attention.  They have no idea what these guys did and they  had years to mess with this data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And there are other technology companies that wanted a  foothold in China but would not adhere to China rules, in terms of forcing  the technology.  Look at Google.</p><p>By the way, Google now reportedly bracing for a fine of up to $11 billion  following an anti-trust issue in the European Union.  That of course,  investigation into the company according to the \"Financial Times\" is coming  to a head.  This would be the second major penalty for Google coming from  the European competition regulators.</p><p>What's going on in terms of regulation within tech?  We're just at the  beginning of this.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  We are.  And it's really important that we have some threat of  regulation because the companies have done a terrible job of self- regulation.  I mean, they have been given all the room in the world to  manage themselves and yet we've clearly seen one disaster after another.</p><p>And the issues that Google faces in Europe are not unique to Google.   Amazon has competitive issues in many markets around the world.  Facebook  is clearly behaving like a monopolist around the world.  And as a  consequence, regulators I think are appropriately worried that the  entrepreneurial economy, especially in this country, is being stifled.</p><p>These guys are blocking the new startups from getting going.  They're  really limiting the rate of innovation in this country.  And that's not the  American way.  The American way is we let a thousand flowers bloom.  We let  entrepreneur create new things.</p><p>And these guys can be really successful without blocking every new thing  that comes along.  And it's important for regulators to make that point and  find ways to constrain them so that we can have this kind of economy that  really supports jobs all across America.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are there other companies out there that are also selling the  data right now that we don't even know about?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I assume so.  In fact, I think you have to assume that whatever  data you had that was in one of these systems has been compromised  somewhere.  The only company that has made a strategy of protecting your  data is Apple and even there I don't think you can feel 100 percent safe.   But you're going to feel much safer there.</p><p>The worst offenders on this have been the Android operating system that  Google owns and Facebook.  Both of which have been so porous that frankly,  you just have to assume everything has been compromised.</p><p>And so that's why when regulators look at this, the important thing to look  at is to protect users from inappropriate usage of their data going forward  -- there's no way to get the data back.  So what you have to do is place  restrictions on how it's used.  We have to be given control over what any  company does with the data that they have.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's that.  There's also the issue of conservative ideas  being crushed, being, you know, eliminated.  So we had Kevin McCarthy on  the show recently, the majority leader, he said that.  That, you know,  these companies are editing the information that we all see.  We had Devin  Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee Sunday who said the same thing.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  There's no question that they edit like crazy.  But I think the  perception they edit one side more than the other is not actually correct.   I think what's going on is that these companies are not transparent.  We  have no idea what they're doing when they edit.</p><p>I think in reality, what they're doing is creating what is known as a  filter bubble around each person.  They give each person what that person  wants and their idea of what that person wants may or may not be correct.   But their notion is they give you your preferences all the time and  reinforce that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you saw the story last week where if you typed in GOP in  California, you pulled up a list of ideologies on Google and one of them  was Nazism.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  No, no, no.  That kind of stuff is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How does that happen -- Roger?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  The answer is this stuff is totally automated and these people  have no idea, right.  They're trying to sell ads.  They're not worried  about truth.  They're not worried about fact.  They're worried about  engagement.  They're worried about their revenue.  They want to give you  what they think you want.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now they can be worried -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  They obviously thought somebody wanted to know the party  sentiment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now they're going to have to worry about regulation.  I mean  Devin Nunes said look -- </p><p>MCNAMEE:  They should have to worry about regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- if somebody doesn't come in the free market and do what  Google does and make sure to promise us that they're not going to be  editing things like this, then it's fine.  If not, we're going to have to  look at this as if they're monopolies.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  You have to look that way.  Now, I think it's about time people  started to look at them that way.  The right answer in the short run is to  force them to have a button at the top that gives you a choice of view.   You can give me what you think I want.  But I want to be able to see an  unfiltered view as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick -- would you put money into this sector today?  Do  you want to buy any of these stocks?  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  I don't want to buy any of them.  I own -- I still own some  Facebook, I still own Apple, I still own Amazon.  I would not -- I think  we're very late in the market cycle.  I think rates are still rising.   There's a lot of uncertainty on global trade and the tech industry's really  sensitive to global trade.</p><p>So I think it looks good relative to the market but I'm nervous about the  market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are so good.  How's the band going?  Moonalice?</p><p>MCNAMEE:  Awesome -- playing a lot of rock and roll.  It's summertime.   Moonalice.com for anybody who wants to check it out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are my rock and roll mentor.  Roger -- good to see you.  </p><p>MCNAMEE:  Always great to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roger McNamee.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  welcome back.</p><p>Las Vegas police releasing 9-1-1 calls from the deadliest mass shooting in  modern U.S. history.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They're tough to listen to -- Maria.</p><p>You hear things like panic, you hear fear, you hear the desperation in  these voices; as you said, Las Vegas police releasing these 9-1-1 calls  eight months after the mass shooting.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My friend just got shot.  We need an ambulance.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have three gunshot wounds and I have no idea where  we re.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You need an ambulance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And there's so many calls to listen to, folks.  Authorities also  releasing this video from surveillance cameras that show people frantically  fleeing the scene.  The gunfire came from the 32nd floor windows of the  Mandalay Bay Resort; 58 people were killed that night.</p><p>Well, incredible video of a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming last  night.  The National Weather Service said the tornado was on the ground for  at least 45 minutes.  Some brave people heading outside, snapping photos of  the monstrous twister -- brave or maybe just crazy, I don't know.</p><p>You can see the massive thunderstorm that sparked the tornado hovering  above.  No word yet if there was any damage or injuries but incredible  pictures.</p><p>Well, a more than 50 percent jump in fuel cost is hitting air travelers  right in the wallet as airlines start to raise their fares.  Delta Airlines  cutting its profit forecast for the year, adding it could take anywhere  from six months to a year to make up for increase fuel costs.  United  Airlines also expected to raise ticket prices very soon.  Shares of Delta  Airlines are down about 3 percent this year.  United Continental up about 4  percent.</p><p>Ok, here's something a little more fun.  For a bride to chew on as she  walks down the aisle, who doesn't want this?  Via Italian Kitchen  announcing this week couples tying the knot this summer could enter to win  an exclusive pizza bouquet and they get a boutonniere.</p><p>They claim it's going to be the first ever of its kind.  I think that's  true.  Entries have to be in by June 15th.  Win or lose, entrants will  receive a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  But for the pizza-loving  bride, Maria -- hey, why not girls do it.  Go for it.  Fully support it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>Coming up -- the battle over immigration.  House Republicans meet for  crucial negotiations today on border control, just as a startling new  report says illegal border crossings had hit 50,000 in the month of May.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The GOP getting ready for a crucial debate on immigration later today;  there are stark divisions within the Republican conference.  This, as the  DHS Reports that border arrests have exceeded 50,000 just for the month of  May.  And this is the third month in a row that they've exceeded 50,000.</p><p>Here now, Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York, a member of the  House Ways and Means Committee, who has signed a discharge petition which  could force votes on immigration.  Congressman -- good to see you, Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Thanks for having me  on -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did you do that?  You need to force a decision on  immigration because it's so in the background at this point.  </p><p>REED:  This has been going on for months.  This is now seven months into  this issue of resolving it, not just for the Dreamers and these kids that  are caught up in a broken immigration system, but more fundamentally to  secure our borders and get this wall and structures constructed to secure  the border so we're starting to fix the problem.</p><p>And this discharge petition is just going to have an open debate on four  bills that will say let's go on record, put the position of the House out  there so that we can then go with the senate and see if we can get to the  White House to sign this and start legislating for the people back home.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Congressman -- the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark  Meadows sounded hopeful on the debate.  Here's what he said yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS:  We're still not in a  situation where there's an agreement.  I think there is great progress  that's being made.  Hopefully what we'll see is the objections get smaller  and less of hurdle in the hours to come.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what are the hurdles -- Congressman?  Because, you know, at  the same time, you also hear Mitch McConnell saying this is never getting  anywhere before the midterm elections.  </p><p>REED:  Well, I'm glad to hear that type of conversation.  And I think this  petition is forcing and leveraging the pressure that is necessary to  finally say let's get this done.  And some of the issues that are out there  is what is the path for potential citizenship for the Dreamers, how much  money will go into the wall?  How much money will go into technology?  But  those are issues that we can work out and should have worked out months  ago.  But now we're getting to the point where it will get resolved because  they have no other option because the clock is ticking.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me switch gears here because we're waiting on the IG  report.  Jim Comey apparently defied authority when he was the FBI  director.  That's what we understand is in the IG report.  Does this chip  away at credibility there?  What are you expecting in terms of the  inspector general report which is forthcoming -- we expect this week.  </p><p>REED:  Well, first of all, absolutely it chips away at Mr. Comey's  credibility.  And remember who the IG is.  This is essentially the internal  affairs, the police of the police if you would, whose job is not to conduct  a political investigation but to hold accountable our government officials  such as James Comey to say look, I'm going to call balls and strikes here.</p><p>And that they are clearly saying and the information I'm hearing is  troublesome.  You acted insubordinate, in an insubordinate manner.  And at  the end of the day, when you have your FBI director doing that, we should  learn from it, we should hold people accountable and move forward in a  stronger fashion.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Congressman -- hi, James Freeman with the \"Wall Street Journal\".   We've been talking about the revelations this week that in order to  facilitate the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama secretly sought to give  Iran the ability to transact through the American financial system in order  to get frozen assets converted into dollars and then euros.</p><p>Does this -- does this change the politics in terms of how people on  Capitol Hill view the President's decision to abandon that deal?  Or is  this kind of a partisan rut where it doesn't have much impact?  </p><p>REED:  I hope it does.  But it definitely illustrates what I've been saying  all along about the Iranian deal.  That was, President Obama's  administration saying they were out of time, they needed to cut a deal,  they wanted to put this win up on the board.  And they were willing to  negotiate everything away in order to get the Iranian deal signed into law  in my humble opinion.</p><p>And this is yet just another sign of how they were doing that and trying to  move the ball for political deadlines rather than what we should be  focusing on, is substance of a deal that is going to keep nuclear weapons  out of the hands of Iranians.</p><p>And now what has happened is the President has gone forward in a leadership  role to say we're going to hold these guys accountable.  We're not going to  honor a deal that was done in a hasty manner in order to achieve some type  of deadline because they were leaving the White House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good for those banks to push back and say we're not going do  it.  </p><p>REED:  Amen.  Thank God they did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want -- I want to add one thing, Congressman -- in terms  of it was almost as if American banks and even businesses knew that this  was a bad deal from the start.  </p><p>REED:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And would not step up because, again, you had just myriad  businesses in Europe immediately beginning to transact business with Iran  after this deal was done, oh so anxiously going into that country.  You did  not have that in the United States.</p><p>Boeing is kind of one of the only examples that we can cite of inking a  deal with Iran.  So it wasn't just the banks.  It was scores of other  companies.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's a great point.  And this is why we have a process for  treaties where people in this country, people overseas -- they understand  it's a real agreement.  The United States has made a decision.</p><p>President Obama didn't do that.  He basically got around the need for a  treaty.  They had this cheap maneuver in the Congress -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For the U.N.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, good for American businesses and banks in this case saying  this isn't going to fly and it won't fly with our customer.  </p><p>REED:  And if I could add, a great point, and that is why when President  Trump did this with the Iranian deal, it squarely is going to put American  businesses as well as European businesses, who are you going to side with?   The Iranians or America?</p><p>And that is going to be further leveraged to say I know where people will  want to do business. That's with us as proud Americans.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- real quick before you go.  Are you going to do  phase two of the tax cut plan before the midterms?  </p><p>REED:  We're definitely moving forward on the committee.  We're drafting  that.  We're working on it, having conversations.  And we want to do it.   We want to protect those individuals and make this code permanent for  individuals as well as the expensing provisions for businesses across the  country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you think that will be something we'll see before the  midterms?  </p><p>REED:  I do believe so.  We're on track to get that done and that's exactly  where I think we're going to land.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you sir.  Thank you.</p><p>REED:  Thanks for having us on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tom Reed joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the power of big tech -- the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 hitting  record highs, boosted by the technology sector.  We're taking at look at  how long this rally can last. </p><p>Then bottoms up at Wal-Mart -- the retailer going upscale with wine at  bargain prices.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  It is Thursday, June 7th.  Your top  stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>It is looking like a mixed picture for markets at the opening of trading  this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a gain of 70 points on the  Dow Jones Industrial average.  This right here, this is the high of the  morning, Dow industrials up 70, S&amp;P and NASDAQ are up just a fraction.  But  it is -- the Dow that's really going to be the splash.  Yesterday it was a  record-breaker for the NASDAQ and the Russell meanwhile.  The Russell 2000  Index and the NASDAQ hitting all-time highs while the Dow and S&amp;P 500  closed the day at their highest levels in three months.  Take a look at  those numbers, pretty strong performance.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story.  London's trading day got off to a  late start.  The market got hit by a rare technical glitch delaying the  open.  The FT-100 is up 20 points right now, the CAC Quarante and DAX index  are higher by a quarter of a percent at this hour.  </p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher as you can see there, with  the exception of China.  Shang Hai Composite was down a fraction.  </p><p>Coming up, more Americans banking on the big inheritance (INAUDIBLE) to  secure their future.  We'll take a look at this trend and how we're  investing it.</p><p>Starbucks customers, getting awakening this morning.  A cup of coffee just  got more expensive.  How much it is going to cost you for your cup of Joe  every morning now?  </p><p>Jessica Alba wants to take her Honest Company global.  The consumer goods  company just got the big bucks to back it up.  We've got the details.</p><p>And why Wal-Mart's bargain thirsty shoppers will soon be drinking up wine  at a discount.  </p><p>Plus this, lady gaga hitting the stage in the first trailer for the highly  anticipated \"A Star is Born.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LADY GAGA, SINGER AND ACTRESS, AS ALLY:  No, I can't do that.  </p><p>BRADLEY COOPER, ACTOR, AS JACKSON MAINE:  You're coming, here we go.  </p><p>GAGA:  Jack, Jack, please, it's not funny.  Jack.</p><p>COOPER:  Look at me.  All you got to do is trust me.  That's all you got to  do. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's sneak peek, already sparking Oscar buzz online.  We've  got more for you coming up.  </p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, big tech continues to power  the markets.  The NASDAQ, the Russell 2000 index hitting at record highs  and the S&amp;P is not far behind.  Joining us right now is the chief  investment officer at Federated Investors, who just throw in there $15  billion in (INAUDIBLE) management, Stephen Auth is with us.  Stephen, good  to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're fully invested here.  </p><p>AUTH:  Well, pretty close.  Yes, we think that the market's heading higher.   The consensus I -- the consensus really is that we're going to roll over as  we approach the peak from back in early January and I think people think  we're late cycle.  Market's expensive.  We think we're not late cycle.  We  don't think the market's expensive.  And we're heading into an earnings  season, probably going to be the best earnings season in almost a decade.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We just came off of a great earnings season.  26 percent profit  growth.</p><p>AUTH:  We did.  And this one's even going to be better.  You know, earnings  will be up about 20 percent.  And we're only weeks away now.  And I think  that's the next focus on the market.  I think when once we power through  the January highs, you know, technically you could have the market head  considerably higher.  </p><p>MURPHY:  And Steve, you pointed out that a lot of people are not bullish  this market, you know, they're giving a lot of reasons why the market  should roll over here.  And having been through 2000 and been through 2008,  but prior to those two periods you had everybody sell your house, invest in  the market.</p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Everybody was uber bullish.  Whereas now, I feel the consensus is  very negative which I think is a great opportunity for the market because  the earnings are really showing real growth in certain sectors.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, it's really funny, we've got this great fundamental backdrop,  yet the overall consensus is very cautious.  I put out a piece a couple of  weeks, I called the five myths.  And to me, you know, talking a lot to  investors, there's this belief that what goes up must come down, that we're  late cycle.  That the market's over expensive.  And it's just, we're not.   We're not late cycle.  If you look at where we are.  The expansion -- the  average expansion in this cycle per year is about 2.1 percent.  Whereas  most economic expansions would be more than double that.  You could argue - - you know, in time it's been long.  But in distance it hasn't been.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the age of it, like we're on our tenth year right now.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, people are worried about the age.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why we're bringing it up, that's what skeptics bring up.  </p><p>AUTH:  I think age is potentially a good thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Age is just a number.  Come on. </p><p>AUTH:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Whatever you are is the new 30.  30 I'm wondering with the --  with the stocks, you're saying they're not expensive.  So, I thin  traditional analysis, you look at trailing earnings and you say, wow,  that's expensive.  You look at forward earnings it looks kind of  reasonable.  </p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Is there a specific yardstick you use to say stocks are cheap,  stocks are not cheap? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, our yardstick is we look forward.  We try to analyze the  fundamentals of where we're heading.  And people have been saying this  market's expensive all the way up and it's mostly because they're looking  at trailing numbers.  But on a -- on a forward basis, this market is not  expensive.  And on individual stocks it's not expensive.  I mean, some of  the stocks we like, you mentioned some of the tech stocks, like Facebook as  an example.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You like that?  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, stock's trading in, 24 times next year's earnings.  That's not  expensive.  Particularly with the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not compared to Amazon.  </p><p>AUTH:  Probably understated, yes, not compared to Amazon, Apple's 16 times,  J.P. Morgan stock we like, it's trading at 13 times.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Wait, why do you say Facebook's earnings are understated? What  does that mean? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, if you look at the traditional accounting in this country,  based on widget production basically, right?  So, when you invest in a  factory, you get to expense that over two decades.  But if you're investing  in tech and data, its immediate expensed.  But there's assets on the  balance sheets of companies like Facebook that are not even on the --  they're off-balance sheet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well they're not monetizing WhatsApp, they're not monetizing  the Messenger.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, all this data has enormous value.  And it's not showing up on  the balance sheets, they're already been expensed and in fact the  acquisition of it hasn't been.  So, you know, if you look on a cash flow  basis, these companies are generating enormous amounts of cash flow.  </p><p>MURPHY:  How much harder is your job right now?  Because the velocity of  change, with new technology coming out, you know, you have a company going  from a start-up, early stage company to a multibillion dollar company in a  couple of years.  Does that make your job and analyzing and valuing these  companies that much harder?</p><p>AUTH:  I think in general investing in stocks has become more and more  difficult.  At the same time, more and more investors have just gone  passive and that's what creates the great opportunity for the active  manager and active managers have now been outperforming the last 12 to 18  months.  There's so much money in the market that just -- is blindly  investing.  In some ways, it makes our job a little bit easier in effect.   But yes, I mean, is the complexity high? That's what you're exploring on  the show every morning.  It's gotten more and more complex.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  It is a complex world.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But even looking back 10 years, are investors still shaken from  the financial crisis and overinvested in fixed income, thinking that fixed  income, particularly treasuries -- longer term treasuries are some sort of  haven, is that the real concern here? </p><p>AUTH:  Well, I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, we're staring at a bear market for something, right?</p><p>AUTH:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's either, it's going to be equities or -- </p><p>AUTH:  I mean, you're half full, half empty.  But I would say that the half  full element here and one of our thesis for what we call the secular bull.   We think we're in this long cycle secular bull is just that, the base of  this expansion is the worst economic crisis since really the great  depression and every economic actor out there has been negatively affected  by this and they all think sooner or later it's going to roll over.  Even  the regulators.  So they've been very kind to this market as a result.  So  when everyone's expecting something to happen, that's usually doesn't  happen.  And that's why stocks we think are still undervalued.  Is there a  bubble in bonds? We're not a believer of that.  We think bond yields are  low for a reason and we think they're going to grind higher but we only  anticipate -- and certainly if we had a big selloff in bonds, that would  hurt equities for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, the Federal Reserve meeting next week,  you're expecting the Fed to raise interest rates?  </p><p>AUTH:  Well, me and everyone else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And everybody else?</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Let's just talk about this for a second, during the break  we were talking about and noticing some of this price increases, the price  of coffee, Starbucks coffee's going up, airline tickets are going up.  What  else did we say? </p><p>MUROHY:  Gas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Gasoline prices are going up.  Is inflation an issue?  How does  the Fed deal with that?  And what does the markets do as rates starts going  higher? </p><p>AUTH:  So, some things are going up.  But there's a lot of stuff not going  up.  Price of diapers isn't going up.  Most staples the prices are not  going up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>AUTH:  But there's not a lot of pricing power.  And you've got the Amazon  effect out there, literally with the Gatling gun on top of the mountain  top, waiting for anyone to volunteer there here (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right -- you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I'll throw it at you this way.  Maybe consumers aren't  getting those price increases passed along, that inflation, but it is  hitting businesses.  Steel prices even before these tariffs go into effect  are up 40 percent in the United States year-to-date or were through the end  of last week, even more year over year.  You have freight costs going up  and Cisco, the food company is saying our costs have gone up.  We can't  pass them under our customers.  That hits profit margins.  So, is that a  concern if you own stocks?  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes, Dagen, we're about to produce a 20 percent year over year  quarterly gains in earnings in the upcoming quarter.  So yes, cost  pressures are affecting some companies and active investors like us, we're  very carefully watching which companies don't have enough pricing power or  aren't.  But there's other ways to offset commodity price increases as you  get productivity.  You get a corporate tax cut and maybe you use some of  that money to pay your workers a little --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the trade issue?  Are you worried about the trade  issue, aluminum and steel tariffs, China fight?  </p><p>AUTH:  No.  We're trying to get free and fair trade.  I mean, you've been  talking about this on the show.  But we just see that as a powerful  negotiation.  The president has most of the cards.  He's a very good  negotiator.  And you go into China, the good cops go in there, Kudlow and - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mnuchin.</p><p>AUTH:  Mnuchin, right?  And they say look, here's the deal.  You guys are  shipping $500 billion to us a year.  We're shipping you 120.  We want that  number to change.  You've got to take down some of your barriers so we can  ship more to you.  Give us $200 billion or the bad cops are going to be  over here, Navarro, etcetera.  That's what's going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, you know what?  I'm so glad you're here.  Because this  was the top of our show.  This was the first words we said.  Dagen brought  this up at the top of the show saying, why we're all worried about all this  trade stuff and look at the markets new record highs.  This is why.   Stephen Auth just told us the sentiments of Wall Street.  </p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.  You think this is all a negotiation.   You just want a better trade deal.  </p><p>AUTH:  And you know, a month ago we were talking about do the Chinese cheat  or not?  Now we're talking about how much is it?  You know, we're up to $80  billion, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AUTH:  Well OK, that's not going to work.  But we'll carry, the bid ask is  now 8200.  I couldn't find a number.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the last time I check, $300 billion cost, to the theft of  intellectual property a year? </p><p>FREEMAN:  You're saying basically you think these larger problems are going  to be pushed aside.  I don't think this is progress that the government  says we're now going to set numbers for imports and exports.  Is it? </p><p>AUTH:  Look, to me the press is hysterical about this and if you think  about it, all the president wants is free and fair trade.  The tariffs is a  cajole he's using to negotiate better terms.   BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>AUTH:  The rest of the world, we're dealing with an entitlement here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>AUTH:  Even our so-called allies in Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>AUTH:  We rebuilt the world after World War II.  We gave them all these  deals.  And now we're saying end of the entitlements.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yesterday Kudlow called the tariffs a tool.  There you go.</p><p>AUTH:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephen, good to see you.  </p><p>AUTH:  Likewise.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Stephen Auth joining us, Federated  Investors.</p><p>Coming up, get ready to pay more for your coffee.  You just heard it.   Starbucks is raising prices again.  We'll tell you how much.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  welcome back.  Starbucks hiking the cost of your morning cup of  coffee again.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  OK, this is going to get expensive, Maria.  Starbucks fans are  going to have to dig a bit deeper for the cup of Joe in the morning.  The  company raising prices between $00.10 and $00.20 on all sizes of its brewed  coffee in most of its stores here in the U.S.  Starbucks blaming the move  on the nine percent increase in operating expenses for the first half of  its fiscal year.  That's compared to last year.  Starbucks shares are down  less than one percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Jessica Alba's Honest Company receiving a fresh round of funding.   The company is getting a $200 million investment from private equity firm L  Catterton.  The Honest says, that the new investment is going to help  expand its business globally, increase product supply and funds of  innovation.  The company has not disclosed the size of the stake that L  Catterton is actually going to receive in all of this.  </p><p>Well, bargain hunters can now grab a fancy bottle of wine at Wal-Mart.  The  company trying to appeal to more upscale tastes, launching its own wine  label called Wine Makers Selection.  Customers are going to be able to buy  10 fine wines from California, France and Italy.  Retailing for about  $11.00 a bottle.  The retailer says the wine will be higher quality than  other brands of wine that it actually currently sells.  This puts them of  course in direct competition with their rival Costco.  Costco's got its own  private wine label.  Shares of Wal-Mart down 14 percent this year.  Costco  shares are up six percent.  </p><p>And then I'm so excited about this, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are  teaming up for the fourth rendition of a \"Star Is Born\" and Oscar buzz is  already swirling.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOPER:  Do you write songs or anything? </p><p>GAGA:  I don't sing my own songs.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why? </p><p>GAGA:  I just don't feel comfortable.  </p><p>COOPER:  Why wouldn't you feel comfortable? </p><p>GAGA:  Almost every single person has told me they like the way I sound,  but they don't like the way I look.  </p><p>COOPER:  I think you're beautiful.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Bradley Cooper is directing Lady Gaga's feature debut as a  Hollywood lead.  Cooper plays an aging performer who takes a shy, talented  young singer played of course by, Lady Gaga.  Under his wing, she of course  brings her musical expertise to the film.  There's a slew of original songs  for this one.  She wrote a handful of them with Cooper and other artists  like Mark Ronson and Willie Nelson's son, Lukas.  \"A Star is Born\" hits  theaters October 5th.  I was actually looking at the trailer last night.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow that really does look good.  I'm looking forward to it too.  </p><p>CASONE:  Her songs are incredible on this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, she's going to be compared to Janet Gaynor,  Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand who all played this role.  So, that's  what she will be compared to.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, so, you're saying --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  High expectation.  Coming up, windfall as the pathway to  wealth, we'll tell you why a third of Americans are banking on an  inheritance to shore up their financial futures.  Are you one of them,  next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans are relying on their parents for  money, that's according to a new report from Merrill Edge that finds one in  three Americans are relying on an inheritance for financial stability.   Joining us right now in a FOX Business Exclusive is Bank of America Merrill  Edge head Aron Levine.  Good to see you, Aron.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>ARON LEVINE, MERRILL EDGE HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA:  Hey, good to see you  again.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, this survey finds that number jumping to 63 percent.</p><p>LEVINE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  When narrowed down between generation z or those aged between  18 and 22.  Tell us about it.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Yes, you think about that 18 to 22, that youngest generation is  facing three really serious challenges, right?  One, student debt.  It's  now up to $1.5 trillion.  29 percent increase in just the last four years.   All right, that's one huge one.  Second one, it is a fact that their  parents are living longer, they have a perception they're going to live  longer.  So now, I'm thinking about what if I live in to my 80s or 90s.   And how do I finance that?  Over the course of time.  And third is, they  are now at point now where they're starting college and thinking about well  I need to save for a home someday.  I have always competing priorities.   So, when you take in those three things, student debt, longevity and  competing priorities, they're saying, boy, I hope I get some inheritance to  solve this problem.  Because I'm really not sure how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since, I know an 18-year-old is not thinking  about their retirement.  But they're not getting Social Security, today's  18-year-old, I don't think, now that we know that the Social Security going  to be dipping into its trust fund for the first time in 36 years.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Right. Yes.  So, it's really creating a new normal in a lot of  ways.  In terms of how to redefine retirement.  I think we talked about the  last time I was on, if you're in your young 20s, you're not sincerely  saying at 65 I'm going to have this pot of money and I'm just going to get  out of the workforce.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>LEVINE:  I think there's a clear view that says, you know, I may continue  working, hopefully it's not in the same job I'm in and I have some  financial freedom.  But the question is, how do I finance that over the  course of time versus some lump sum I have to have by a certain age?  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, Aron, one thing I see as a big change in the landscape, this  would be access that the younger generation has to information, it's  education.  I think 18 to 22-year-olds today are starting to learn more and  focus more about their money, about retirement, about what they're going to  need.  And I think that's a huge benefit to the entire country.  </p><p>LEVINE:  You're absolutely right.  So, I think all those fears that I sort  of talked about, that the upside is they're very self-aware and they are  actually taking advantage of the access.  So they go online, they're  starting to educate themselves.  And it's our job, places like Merrill Edge  and Bank of America to provide that education access and then say, what  would you like to do about it?  And I think what you're seeing is, that's  leading towards where this generation has a kind of profits and purpose  mindset.  So if I'm going to invest my money, I want to invest in something  that's a little more socially conscious.  And that's why it's important  that all of the industry is delivering those kinds of investment vehicles  so that generation can say boy, I do want to invest.  I'd love to invest in  a company that has a certain sort of moral compass.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And so, when you advise Generation Z, step one, do you say OK,  your parents by the way are going to live maybe to 100 and by the way,  we're looking at the finances of Social Security and Medicare, you're  probably on your own.  </p><p>LEVINE:  Yes, I think the -- hopefully not in your -- on one ways you're  not on your own, as you can get some advice and there are ways to reach  out.  I think what we're trying to do is say, one, you're your self- educated and focus on a plan.  Like anything, like, you can't just do it  without a very clear plan.  So that's what we key on is getting them a life  plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you.  Good to see you.  Aron Levine, Bank of  America.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Thursday, June 7th.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, June 7.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher, take a look. But that was the high of the morning, actually. Futures indicating a gain of about 56 points on the Dow Industrials; the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are up but just barely, 3 points higher on the S&amp;P. This after the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes closed at new highs again yesterday. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 finished at their highest levels in three months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe this morning, mixed performances, take a look. It was a rough start for London this morning. Trading on the London stock exchange was delayed this morning due to a technical issue. The FT 100 is now up just seven points. The CAC 40 is up a fraction, a third of a percent and the DAX index is also higher by a fraction in Germany.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, take a look, with the exception of China which was down a fraction.</p><p>Trade tensions -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed to the White House today ahead of the G-7 meeting this weekend. President Trump at odds with the other six nations in the G-7 going into the summit over the tariff and trade policy out of this White House.</p><p>The administration's top official, Larry Kudlow, says this is not a major fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR: I regard this as much like a family quarrel. I'm always the optimist. President Trump is very clear with respect to his trade reform efforts that we will do what is necessary to protect the United States, its businesses and its workforce.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have the very latest on trade coming up.</p><p>Plus, a high stakes meeting on f Capitol Hill -- Republican lawmakers coming together to try to hammer out a deal on immigration. It comes amid a startling new report on illegal border crossings -- 50,000 people were arrested just last month.</p><p>An unbelievable scene in Wyoming to show you -- a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming. We've got the very latest. Look at those pictures. Wow.</p><p>Meanwhile soaring oil prices set to cost you, airlines are now raising the price of tickets. The details coming up.</p><p>And a new twist on bridal bouquets, a pizza parlor now offering arrangements made of pizza. But how do you throw it?</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to talk all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff Capital CEO and managing partner Mike Murphy, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. Who would want to catch it if it's all pizza?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well how about maybe just the dough where, you know, you're working on the dough and then you toss it out to the crowd.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're in a wedding dress.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL: Everyone's always wanted to do that, right. Whenever you go in a pizza joint you always want to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I did it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh, very good.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: She can -- this is Maria Bartiromo's wheelhouse that you just entered. She can toss dough in the air.</p><p>FREEMAN: Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. We've seen this.</p><p>FREEMAN: Has this been a segment on the show, yet or --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I did a segment on \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" with my sister when we made my father's pizza.</p><p>MURPHY: We need to do that again, for sure.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, it could be an annual --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: More than annual.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're going to send a camera crew to your house, like when you're with your family, making pizza. It would be awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll show you how to make pizza.</p><p>Look, we've got to get into the story about Iran. You mentioned it earlier and what went on in the Obama administration --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- in terms of allowing Iran to have access to the U.S. financial system.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. So the President had said as part of his terrible nuclear deal, don't worry -- he said this to Congress -- I'm not going to let the Iranians into the U.S. banking system. That's one sanction I'm not going to remove.</p><p>Well, they figure out that if they want to give Iran access to billions of dollars, that Iran wanted it in dollars and then to convert that to euros. So they decided secretly to issue a license allowing Iran to transact in the U.S. banking system.</p><p>Well, the plan failed because U.S. banks would not participate. And I know over the last decade especially, people have really beaten up on the big banks. I've been among those people. And I think this is a time where you've got to say hats off to bankers for --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Two major banks said no, we're not doing it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. And good for them to say no, we're not going to participate in this secret deal to fund the Ayatollah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I remember right after the Iranian nuclear deal was inked, because of the sanctions on U.S. banks, John Kerry took a trip to I think it was London and met with all these banking heads and all these executives in the financial system and was trying to encourage them to do business with Iran --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- which would have been illegal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- literally said we've got restrictions on U.S. banks but you guys, you can go ahead and start transacting business with Iran because they were so desperate for the deal to work and for money to get funneled.</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. The banks had regulators they had to answer to -- that's why they couldn't do it when the President --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they knew --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The banks were afraid of breaking the law.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think we ought to give more credit -- I don't think it was just compliance. I think they made the right decision and they realized the customers wouldn't like this either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is a big story. We're going to talk about this about coming.</p><p>We've got Financial Services Committee member and Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy coming up so we will ask him about that along with Ways and Means Committee member and New York Congressman Tom Reed. We'll see what they think about this whole Iran situation.</p><p>Plus, Murray Energy founder and president and CEO Bob Murray has a thing or two to say about trade and tariff as well.</p><p>So stay with us on all of that coming up. Big hour coming up.</p><p>But first this top story and that is trade tensions. President Trump meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today ahead of the G-7 meeting and the President's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway is live at the White House this morning with more. Doug -- good morning to you.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>And this marks about the start of the President's busiest week since he assumed office. It begins this afternoon with the visit of Japanese President Shinzo Abe who arrives here at 12:00 noon. The two men are planning for a joint press conference at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>They have hit it all very well as you well know. Shinzo Abe was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump Tower during the transition, later invited to Mar-A-Lago where the two men enjoyed golf. They seemed to have hit it off very, very well.</p><p>No country has a greater interest in reining in North Korea's nuclear capability than Japan. That country is truly facing an existential threat from Kim Jong-un's ballistic missiles. His meeting with Trump today points out that the upcoming summit in Singapore is not really a bilateral meeting, although it is that by name, but that the interest of many countries -- Japan, South Korea, China, the Pacific Rim countries and many others -- all have a very important stake in this.</p><p>Complicating the preparations for the summit is the G-7 meeting in Quebec tomorrow which the President will attend. It comes amid heated debate over President Trump's pursuit of more tariffs against Canada, against Mexico, against the European Union and the President's ban against the Japanese -- excuse me, the Chinese phone company ZTE which has been accused of evading the ban on sanctions against Iran and North Korea.</p><p>Larry Kudlow was asked about whether there's been a consideration of lifting the ban on ZTE yesterday. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KUDLOW: No decisions on both sides as of now. And of course, I refer you to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce. But as of this moment, no decision has been reached by both sides.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: Trump leaves for the G-7 summit tomorrow. From there he will jet off to Singapore where so much is at stake, so much is unknown, and so many countries are awaiting eagerly to find out what happens and whether there will be subsequent meetings at all.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. And we check back as news develops. Doug -- thank you. Doug McKelway there --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- at the White House this morning.</p><p>Facebook fallout -- Senator Ed Markey is calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Cngress again following backlash over the social media company's data partnership with Chinese phone maker Huawei.</p><p>Yesterday, the Senator tweeted this, \"For more than 10 years Facebook has shared users' personal data with Chinese companies including one with close ties to the Chinese Communist Party. I'm calling for Mark Zuckerberg to come to the Senate and explain how U.S. national security was not jeopardized.\"</p><p>Here's a look back to what Zuckerberg said during his testimony on the hill back in April.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake and I'm sorry. I started Facebook. I run it. And I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg, early investor in Facebook certainly, and managing director and co-founder of Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee here with us. Roger -- great to see you.</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS: Always great to be here -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So you've previously voiced your concerns over Facebook and the business model. How do you feel about the response from Facebook? Where are we now on this issue?</p><p>MCNAMEE: We're nowhere near the end, unfortunately. The company had this model for years called \"move fast and break things\". The notion was don't let anything get in the way of growth.</p><p>The reality is it was really \"move fast, break things, apologize and then move on\" as though nothing has happened. And that's really where Mark is now. He's apologizing because every rock we turn over has another scandal hidden underneath it.</p><p>And this one in China, we don't know exactly how bad it is. What we know, though, is that Facebook was not monitoring these companies. And if the Defense Department is telling us they won't buy Huawei products because they're afraid of bugging and hacking, I think we have to be concerned that Huawei with 10 years or whatever of control of Facebook user accounts is going to have had the opportunity to download all that data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think this is one of the biggest stories of our time, frankly. When you look at China and what has occurred and the fact that there's this massive technology transfer going on, where China acquires American companies, forces the transfer of technology and then you see Facebook, it's not the technology or secrets but it's all their user data.</p><p>MCNAMEE: And Mark has worked so hard to try to get in the good graces of the Chinese government in order to have the opportunity to participate there --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the thing though, yes.</p><p>MCNAMEE: -- and so I do not find their response even remotely comforting, because their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the bare minimum when they're forced to. And the situation here is they weren't paying attention. They have no idea what these guys did and they had years to mess with this data.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And there are other technology companies that wanted a foothold in China but would not adhere to China rules, in terms of forcing the technology. Look at Google.</p><p>By the way, Google now reportedly bracing for a fine of up to $11 billion following an anti-trust issue in the European Union. That of course, investigation into the company according to the \"Financial Times\" is coming to a head. This would be the second major penalty for Google coming from the European competition regulators.</p><p>What's going on in terms of regulation within tech? We're just at the beginning of this.</p><p>MCNAMEE: We are. And it's really important that we have some threat of regulation because the companies have done a terrible job of self- regulation. I mean, they have been given all the room in the world to manage themselves and yet we've clearly seen one disaster after another.</p><p>And the issues that Google faces in Europe are not unique to Google. Amazon has competitive issues in many markets around the world. Facebook is clearly behaving like a monopolist around the world. And as a consequence, regulators I think are appropriately worried that the entrepreneurial economy, especially in this country, is being stifled.</p><p>These guys are blocking the new startups from getting going. They're really limiting the rate of innovation in this country. And that's not the American way. The American way is we let a thousand flowers bloom. We let entrepreneur create new things.</p><p>And these guys can be really successful without blocking every new thing that comes along. And it's important for regulators to make that point and find ways to constrain them so that we can have this kind of economy that really supports jobs all across America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are there other companies out there that are also selling the data right now that we don't even know about?</p><p>MCNAMEE: I assume so. In fact, I think you have to assume that whatever data you had that was in one of these systems has been compromised somewhere. The only company that has made a strategy of protecting your data is Apple and even there I don't think you can feel 100 percent safe. But you're going to feel much safer there.</p><p>The worst offenders on this have been the Android operating system that Google owns and Facebook. Both of which have been so porous that frankly, you just have to assume everything has been compromised.</p><p>And so that's why when regulators look at this, the important thing to look at is to protect users from inappropriate usage of their data going forward -- there's no way to get the data back. So what you have to do is place restrictions on how it's used. We have to be given control over what any company does with the data that they have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's that. There's also the issue of conservative ideas being crushed, being, you know, eliminated. So we had Kevin McCarthy on the show recently, the majority leader, he said that. That, you know, these companies are editing the information that we all see. We had Devin Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee Sunday who said the same thing.</p><p>MCNAMEE: There's no question that they edit like crazy. But I think the perception they edit one side more than the other is not actually correct. I think what's going on is that these companies are not transparent. We have no idea what they're doing when they edit.</p><p>I think in reality, what they're doing is creating what is known as a filter bubble around each person. They give each person what that person wants and their idea of what that person wants may or may not be correct. But their notion is they give you your preferences all the time and reinforce that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you saw the story last week where if you typed in GOP in California, you pulled up a list of ideologies on Google and one of them was Nazism.</p><p>MCNAMEE: No, no, no. That kind of stuff is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: How does that happen -- Roger?</p><p>MCNAMEE: The answer is this stuff is totally automated and these people have no idea, right. They're trying to sell ads. They're not worried about truth. They're not worried about fact. They're worried about engagement. They're worried about their revenue. They want to give you what they think you want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now they can be worried --</p><p>MCNAMEE: They obviously thought somebody wanted to know the party sentiment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now they're going to have to worry about regulation. I mean Devin Nunes said look --</p><p>MCNAMEE: They should have to worry about regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- if somebody doesn't come in the free market and do what Google does and make sure to promise us that they're not going to be editing things like this, then it's fine. If not, we're going to have to look at this as if they're monopolies.</p><p>MCNAMEE: You have to look that way. Now, I think it's about time people started to look at them that way. The right answer in the short run is to force them to have a button at the top that gives you a choice of view. You can give me what you think I want. But I want to be able to see an unfiltered view as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a great point.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick -- would you put money into this sector today? Do you want to buy any of these stocks?</p><p>MCNAMEE: I don't want to buy any of them. I own -- I still own some Facebook, I still own Apple, I still own Amazon. I would not -- I think we're very late in the market cycle. I think rates are still rising. There's a lot of uncertainty on global trade and the tech industry's really sensitive to global trade.</p><p>So I think it looks good relative to the market but I'm nervous about the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are so good. How's the band going? Moonalice?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Awesome -- playing a lot of rock and roll. It's summertime. Moonalice.com for anybody who wants to check it out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are my rock and roll mentor. Roger -- good to see you.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Always great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Roger McNamee. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: welcome back.</p><p>Las Vegas police releasing 9-1-1 calls from the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: They're tough to listen to -- Maria.</p><p>You hear things like panic, you hear fear, you hear the desperation in these voices; as you said, Las Vegas police releasing these 9-1-1 calls eight months after the mass shooting. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My friend just got shot. We need an ambulance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We have three gunshot wounds and I have no idea where we re.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You need an ambulance.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: And there's so many calls to listen to, folks. Authorities also releasing this video from surveillance cameras that show people frantically fleeing the scene. The gunfire came from the 32nd floor windows of the Mandalay Bay Resort; 58 people were killed that night.</p><p>Well, incredible video of a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming last night. The National Weather Service said the tornado was on the ground for at least 45 minutes. Some brave people heading outside, snapping photos of the monstrous twister -- brave or maybe just crazy, I don't know.</p><p>You can see the massive thunderstorm that sparked the tornado hovering above. No word yet if there was any damage or injuries but incredible pictures.</p><p>Well, a more than 50 percent jump in fuel cost is hitting air travelers right in the wallet as airlines start to raise their fares. Delta Airlines cutting its profit forecast for the year, adding it could take anywhere from six months to a year to make up for increase fuel costs. United Airlines also expected to raise ticket prices very soon. Shares of Delta Airlines are down about 3 percent this year. United Continental up about 4 percent.</p><p>Ok, here's something a little more fun. For a bride to chew on as she walks down the aisle, who doesn't want this? Via Italian Kitchen announcing this week couples tying the knot this summer could enter to win an exclusive pizza bouquet and they get a boutonniere.</p><p>They claim it's going to be the first ever of its kind. I think that's true. Entries have to be in by June 15th. Win or lose, entrants will receive a coupon for a free slice of pizza. But for the pizza-loving bride, Maria -- hey, why not girls do it. Go for it. Fully support it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>Coming up -- the battle over immigration. House Republicans meet for crucial negotiations today on border control, just as a startling new report says illegal border crossings had hit 50,000 in the month of May.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The GOP getting ready for a crucial debate on immigration later today; there are stark divisions within the Republican conference. This, as the DHS Reports that border arrests have exceeded 50,000 just for the month of May. And this is the third month in a row that they've exceeded 50,000.</p><p>Here now, Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has signed a discharge petition which could force votes on immigration. Congressman -- good to see you, Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. TOM REED (R-NY), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: Thanks for having me on -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why did you do that? You need to force a decision on immigration because it's so in the background at this point.</p><p>REED: This has been going on for months. This is now seven months into this issue of resolving it, not just for the Dreamers and these kids that are caught up in a broken immigration system, but more fundamentally to secure our borders and get this wall and structures constructed to secure the border so we're starting to fix the problem.</p><p>And this discharge petition is just going to have an open debate on four bills that will say let's go on record, put the position of the House out there so that we can then go with the senate and see if we can get to the White House to sign this and start legislating for the people back home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Congressman -- the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows sounded hopeful on the debate. Here's what he said yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS: We're still not in a situation where there's an agreement. I think there is great progress that's being made. Hopefully what we'll see is the objections get smaller and less of hurdle in the hours to come.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are the hurdles -- Congressman? Because, you know, at the same time, you also hear Mitch McConnell saying this is never getting anywhere before the midterm elections.</p><p>REED: Well, I'm glad to hear that type of conversation. And I think this petition is forcing and leveraging the pressure that is necessary to finally say let's get this done. And some of the issues that are out there is what is the path for potential citizenship for the Dreamers, how much money will go into the wall? How much money will go into technology? But those are issues that we can work out and should have worked out months ago. But now we're getting to the point where it will get resolved because they have no other option because the clock is ticking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So let me switch gears here because we're waiting on the IG report. Jim Comey apparently defied authority when he was the FBI director. That's what we understand is in the IG report. Does this chip away at credibility there? What are you expecting in terms of the inspector general report which is forthcoming -- we expect this week.</p><p>REED: Well, first of all, absolutely it chips away at Mr. Comey's credibility. And remember who the IG is. This is essentially the internal affairs, the police of the police if you would, whose job is not to conduct a political investigation but to hold accountable our government officials such as James Comey to say look, I'm going to call balls and strikes here.</p><p>And that they are clearly saying and the information I'm hearing is troublesome. You acted insubordinate, in an insubordinate manner. And at the end of the day, when you have your FBI director doing that, we should learn from it, we should hold people accountable and move forward in a stronger fashion.</p><p>FREEMAN: Congressman -- hi, James Freeman with the \"Wall Street Journal\". We've been talking about the revelations this week that in order to facilitate the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama secretly sought to give Iran the ability to transact through the American financial system in order to get frozen assets converted into dollars and then euros.</p><p>Does this -- does this change the politics in terms of how people on Capitol Hill view the President's decision to abandon that deal? Or is this kind of a partisan rut where it doesn't have much impact?</p><p>REED: I hope it does. But it definitely illustrates what I've been saying all along about the Iranian deal. That was, President Obama's administration saying they were out of time, they needed to cut a deal, they wanted to put this win up on the board. And they were willing to negotiate everything away in order to get the Iranian deal signed into law in my humble opinion.</p><p>And this is yet just another sign of how they were doing that and trying to move the ball for political deadlines rather than what we should be focusing on, is substance of a deal that is going to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of Iranians.</p><p>And now what has happened is the President has gone forward in a leadership role to say we're going to hold these guys accountable. We're not going to honor a deal that was done in a hasty manner in order to achieve some type of deadline because they were leaving the White House.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good for those banks to push back and say we're not going do it.</p><p>REED: Amen. Thank God they did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want -- I want to add one thing, Congressman -- in terms of it was almost as if American banks and even businesses knew that this was a bad deal from the start.</p><p>REED: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And would not step up because, again, you had just myriad businesses in Europe immediately beginning to transact business with Iran after this deal was done, oh so anxiously going into that country. You did not have that in the United States.</p><p>Boeing is kind of one of the only examples that we can cite of inking a deal with Iran. So it wasn't just the banks. It was scores of other companies.</p><p>FREEMAN: It's a great point. And this is why we have a process for treaties where people in this country, people overseas -- they understand it's a real agreement. The United States has made a decision.</p><p>President Obama didn't do that. He basically got around the need for a treaty. They had this cheap maneuver in the Congress --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: For the U.N.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, good for American businesses and banks in this case saying this isn't going to fly and it won't fly with our customer.</p><p>REED: And if I could add, a great point, and that is why when President Trump did this with the Iranian deal, it squarely is going to put American businesses as well as European businesses, who are you going to side with? The Iranians or America?</p><p>And that is going to be further leveraged to say I know where people will want to do business. That's with us as proud Americans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- real quick before you go. Are you going to do phase two of the tax cut plan before the midterms?</p><p>REED: We're definitely moving forward on the committee. We're drafting that. We're working on it, having conversations. And we want to do it. We want to protect those individuals and make this code permanent for individuals as well as the expensing provisions for businesses across the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you think that will be something we'll see before the midterms?</p><p>REED: I do believe so. We're on track to get that done and that's exactly where I think we're going to land.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- good to see you sir. Thank you.</p><p>REED: Thanks for having us on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Reed joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, the power of big tech -- the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 hitting record highs, boosted by the technology sector. We're taking at look at how long this rally can last.</p><p>Then bottoms up at Wal-Mart -- the retailer going upscale with wine at bargain prices.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning everybody. Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Thanks for joining us. It is Thursday, June 7th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>It is looking like a mixed picture for markets at the opening of trading this morning. Take a look at Futures indicating a gain of 70 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average. This right here, this is the high of the morning, Dow industrials up 70, S&amp;P and NASDAQ are up just a fraction. But it is -- the Dow that's really going to be the splash. Yesterday it was a record-breaker for the NASDAQ and the Russell meanwhile. The Russell 2000 Index and the NASDAQ hitting all-time highs while the Dow and S&amp;P 500 closed the day at their highest levels in three months. Take a look at those numbers, pretty strong performance.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story. London's trading day got off to a late start. The market got hit by a rare technical glitch delaying the open. The FT-100 is up 20 points right now, the CAC Quarante and DAX index are higher by a quarter of a percent at this hour.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher as you can see there, with the exception of China. Shang Hai Composite was down a fraction.</p><p>Coming up, more Americans banking on the big inheritance (INAUDIBLE) to secure their future. We'll take a look at this trend and how we're investing it.</p><p>Starbucks customers, getting awakening this morning. A cup of coffee just got more expensive. How much it is going to cost you for your cup of Joe every morning now?</p><p>Jessica Alba wants to take her Honest Company global. The consumer goods company just got the big bucks to back it up. We've got the details.</p><p>And why Wal-Mart's bargain thirsty shoppers will soon be drinking up wine at a discount.</p><p>Plus this, lady gaga hitting the stage in the first trailer for the highly anticipated \"A Star is Born.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LADY GAGA, SINGER AND ACTRESS, AS ALLY: No, I can't do that.</p><p>BRADLEY COOPER, ACTOR, AS JACKSON MAINE: You're coming, here we go.</p><p>GAGA: Jack, Jack, please, it's not funny. Jack.</p><p>COOPER: Look at me. All you got to do is trust me. That's all you got to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's sneak peek, already sparking Oscar buzz online. We've got more for you coming up.</p><p>But first, this top story this half an hour, big tech continues to power the markets. The NASDAQ, the Russell 2000 index hitting at record highs and the S&amp;P is not far behind. Joining us right now is the chief investment officer at Federated Investors, who just throw in there $15 billion in (INAUDIBLE) management, Stephen Auth is with us. Stephen, good to see you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>STEPHEN AUTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FEDERATED INVESTORS: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're fully invested here.</p><p>AUTH: Well, pretty close. Yes, we think that the market's heading higher. The consensus I -- the consensus really is that we're going to roll over as we approach the peak from back in early January and I think people think we're late cycle. Market's expensive. We think we're not late cycle. We don't think the market's expensive. And we're heading into an earnings season, probably going to be the best earnings season in almost a decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We just came off of a great earnings season. 26 percent profit growth.</p><p>AUTH: We did. And this one's even going to be better. You know, earnings will be up about 20 percent. And we're only weeks away now. And I think that's the next focus on the market. I think when once we power through the January highs, you know, technically you could have the market head considerably higher.</p><p>MURPHY: And Steve, you pointed out that a lot of people are not bullish this market, you know, they're giving a lot of reasons why the market should roll over here. And having been through 2000 and been through 2008, but prior to those two periods you had everybody sell your house, invest in the market.</p><p>AUTH: Right.</p><p>MURPHY: Everybody was uber bullish. Whereas now, I feel the consensus is very negative which I think is a great opportunity for the market because the earnings are really showing real growth in certain sectors.</p><p>AUTH: Yes, it's really funny, we've got this great fundamental backdrop, yet the overall consensus is very cautious. I put out a piece a couple of weeks, I called the five myths. And to me, you know, talking a lot to investors, there's this belief that what goes up must come down, that we're late cycle. That the market's over expensive. And it's just, we're not. We're not late cycle. If you look at where we are. The expansion -- the average expansion in this cycle per year is about 2.1 percent. Whereas most economic expansions would be more than double that. You could argue - - you know, in time it's been long. But in distance it hasn't been.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the age of it, like we're on our tenth year right now.</p><p>AUTH: Yes, people are worried about the age.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why we're bringing it up, that's what skeptics bring up.</p><p>AUTH: I think age is potentially a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Age is just a number. Come on.</p><p>AUTH: Absolutely.</p><p>FREEMAN: Whatever you are is the new 30. 30 I'm wondering with the -- with the stocks, you're saying they're not expensive. So, I thin traditional analysis, you look at trailing earnings and you say, wow, that's expensive. You look at forward earnings it looks kind of reasonable.</p><p>AUTH: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Is there a specific yardstick you use to say stocks are cheap, stocks are not cheap?</p><p>AUTH: Well, our yardstick is we look forward. We try to analyze the fundamentals of where we're heading. And people have been saying this market's expensive all the way up and it's mostly because they're looking at trailing numbers. But on a -- on a forward basis, this market is not expensive. And on individual stocks it's not expensive. I mean, some of the stocks we like, you mentioned some of the tech stocks, like Facebook as an example.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You like that?</p><p>AUTH: Yes, stock's trading in, 24 times next year's earnings. That's not expensive. Particularly with the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not compared to Amazon.</p><p>AUTH: Probably understated, yes, not compared to Amazon, Apple's 16 times, J.P. Morgan stock we like, it's trading at 13 times.</p><p>FREEMAN: Wait, why do you say Facebook's earnings are understated? What does that mean?</p><p>AUTH: Well, if you look at the traditional accounting in this country, based on widget production basically, right? So, when you invest in a factory, you get to expense that over two decades. But if you're investing in tech and data, its immediate expensed. But there's assets on the balance sheets of companies like Facebook that are not even on the -- they're off-balance sheet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well they're not monetizing WhatsApp, they're not monetizing the Messenger.</p><p>AUTH: Yes, all this data has enormous value. And it's not showing up on the balance sheets, they're already been expensed and in fact the acquisition of it hasn't been. So, you know, if you look on a cash flow basis, these companies are generating enormous amounts of cash flow.</p><p>MURPHY: How much harder is your job right now? Because the velocity of change, with new technology coming out, you know, you have a company going from a start-up, early stage company to a multibillion dollar company in a couple of years. Does that make your job and analyzing and valuing these companies that much harder?</p><p>AUTH: I think in general investing in stocks has become more and more difficult. At the same time, more and more investors have just gone passive and that's what creates the great opportunity for the active manager and active managers have now been outperforming the last 12 to 18 months. There's so much money in the market that just -- is blindly investing. In some ways, it makes our job a little bit easier in effect. But yes, I mean, is the complexity high? That's what you're exploring on the show every morning. It's gotten more and more complex.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: It is a complex world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But even looking back 10 years, are investors still shaken from the financial crisis and overinvested in fixed income, thinking that fixed income, particularly treasuries -- longer term treasuries are some sort of haven, is that the real concern here?</p><p>AUTH: Well, I think --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, we're staring at a bear market for something, right?</p><p>AUTH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's either, it's going to be equities or --</p><p>AUTH: I mean, you're half full, half empty. But I would say that the half full element here and one of our thesis for what we call the secular bull. We think we're in this long cycle secular bull is just that, the base of this expansion is the worst economic crisis since really the great depression and every economic actor out there has been negatively affected by this and they all think sooner or later it's going to roll over. Even the regulators. So they've been very kind to this market as a result. So when everyone's expecting something to happen, that's usually doesn't happen. And that's why stocks we think are still undervalued. Is there a bubble in bonds? We're not a believer of that. We think bond yields are low for a reason and we think they're going to grind higher but we only anticipate -- and certainly if we had a big selloff in bonds, that would hurt equities for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this, the Federal Reserve meeting next week, you're expecting the Fed to raise interest rates?</p><p>AUTH: Well, me and everyone else.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And everybody else?</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Let's just talk about this for a second, during the break we were talking about and noticing some of this price increases, the price of coffee, Starbucks coffee's going up, airline tickets are going up. What else did we say?</p><p>MUROHY: Gas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gasoline prices are going up. Is inflation an issue? How does the Fed deal with that? And what does the markets do as rates starts going higher?</p><p>AUTH: So, some things are going up. But there's a lot of stuff not going up. Price of diapers isn't going up. Most staples the prices are not going up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>AUTH: But there's not a lot of pricing power. And you've got the Amazon effect out there, literally with the Gatling gun on top of the mountain top, waiting for anyone to volunteer there here (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right -- you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I'll throw it at you this way. Maybe consumers aren't getting those price increases passed along, that inflation, but it is hitting businesses. Steel prices even before these tariffs go into effect are up 40 percent in the United States year-to-date or were through the end of last week, even more year over year. You have freight costs going up and Cisco, the food company is saying our costs have gone up. We can't pass them under our customers. That hits profit margins. So, is that a concern if you own stocks?</p><p>AUTH: Yes, Dagen, we're about to produce a 20 percent year over year quarterly gains in earnings in the upcoming quarter. So yes, cost pressures are affecting some companies and active investors like us, we're very carefully watching which companies don't have enough pricing power or aren't. But there's other ways to offset commodity price increases as you get productivity. You get a corporate tax cut and maybe you use some of that money to pay your workers a little --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the trade issue? Are you worried about the trade issue, aluminum and steel tariffs, China fight?</p><p>AUTH: No. We're trying to get free and fair trade. I mean, you've been talking about this on the show. But we just see that as a powerful negotiation. The president has most of the cards. He's a very good negotiator. And you go into China, the good cops go in there, Kudlow and - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mnuchin.</p><p>AUTH: Mnuchin, right? And they say look, here's the deal. You guys are shipping $500 billion to us a year. We're shipping you 120. We want that number to change. You've got to take down some of your barriers so we can ship more to you. Give us $200 billion or the bad cops are going to be over here, Navarro, etcetera. That's what's going on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, you know what? I'm so glad you're here. Because this was the top of our show. This was the first words we said. Dagen brought this up at the top of the show saying, why we're all worried about all this trade stuff and look at the markets new record highs. This is why. Stephen Auth just told us the sentiments of Wall Street.</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not buying it. You think this is all a negotiation. You just want a better trade deal.</p><p>AUTH: And you know, a month ago we were talking about do the Chinese cheat or not? Now we're talking about how much is it? You know, we're up to $80 billion, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>AUTH: Well OK, that's not going to work. But we'll carry, the bid ask is now 8200. I couldn't find a number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the last time I check, $300 billion cost, to the theft of intellectual property a year?</p><p>FREEMAN: You're saying basically you think these larger problems are going to be pushed aside. I don't think this is progress that the government says we're now going to set numbers for imports and exports. Is it?</p><p>AUTH: Look, to me the press is hysterical about this and if you think about it, all the president wants is free and fair trade. The tariffs is a cajole he's using to negotiate better terms. BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>AUTH: The rest of the world, we're dealing with an entitlement here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>AUTH: Even our so-called allies in Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>AUTH: We rebuilt the world after World War II. We gave them all these deals. And now we're saying end of the entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yesterday Kudlow called the tariffs a tool. There you go.</p><p>AUTH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stephen, good to see you.</p><p>AUTH: Likewise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Stephen Auth joining us, Federated Investors.</p><p>Coming up, get ready to pay more for your coffee. You just heard it. Starbucks is raising prices again. We'll tell you how much. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: welcome back. Starbucks hiking the cost of your morning cup of coffee again. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: OK, this is going to get expensive, Maria. Starbucks fans are going to have to dig a bit deeper for the cup of Joe in the morning. The company raising prices between $00.10 and $00.20 on all sizes of its brewed coffee in most of its stores here in the U.S. Starbucks blaming the move on the nine percent increase in operating expenses for the first half of its fiscal year. That's compared to last year. Starbucks shares are down less than one percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, Jessica Alba's Honest Company receiving a fresh round of funding. The company is getting a $200 million investment from private equity firm L Catterton. The Honest says, that the new investment is going to help expand its business globally, increase product supply and funds of innovation. The company has not disclosed the size of the stake that L Catterton is actually going to receive in all of this.</p><p>Well, bargain hunters can now grab a fancy bottle of wine at Wal-Mart. The company trying to appeal to more upscale tastes, launching its own wine label called Wine Makers Selection. Customers are going to be able to buy 10 fine wines from California, France and Italy. Retailing for about $11.00 a bottle. The retailer says the wine will be higher quality than other brands of wine that it actually currently sells. This puts them of course in direct competition with their rival Costco. Costco's got its own private wine label. Shares of Wal-Mart down 14 percent this year. Costco shares are up six percent.</p><p>And then I'm so excited about this, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are teaming up for the fourth rendition of a \"Star Is Born\" and Oscar buzz is already swirling.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOPER: Do you write songs or anything?</p><p>GAGA: I don't sing my own songs.</p><p>COOPER: Why?</p><p>GAGA: I just don't feel comfortable.</p><p>COOPER: Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?</p><p>GAGA: Almost every single person has told me they like the way I sound, but they don't like the way I look.</p><p>COOPER: I think you're beautiful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Bradley Cooper is directing Lady Gaga's feature debut as a Hollywood lead. Cooper plays an aging performer who takes a shy, talented young singer played of course by, Lady Gaga. Under his wing, she of course brings her musical expertise to the film. There's a slew of original songs for this one. She wrote a handful of them with Cooper and other artists like Mark Ronson and Willie Nelson's son, Lukas. \"A Star is Born\" hits theaters October 5th. I was actually looking at the trailer last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow that really does look good. I'm looking forward to it too.</p><p>CASONE: Her songs are incredible on this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just real quick, she's going to be compared to Janet Gaynor, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand who all played this role. So, that's what she will be compared to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so, you're saying --</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: High expectation. Coming up, windfall as the pathway to wealth, we'll tell you why a third of Americans are banking on an inheritance to shore up their financial futures. Are you one of them, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More Americans are relying on their parents for money, that's according to a new report from Merrill Edge that finds one in three Americans are relying on an inheritance for financial stability. Joining us right now in a FOX Business Exclusive is Bank of America Merrill Edge head Aron Levine. Good to see you, Aron. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>ARON LEVINE, MERRILL EDGE HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA: Hey, good to see you again. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, this survey finds that number jumping to 63 percent.</p><p>LEVINE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When narrowed down between generation z or those aged between 18 and 22. Tell us about it.</p><p>LEVINE: Yes, you think about that 18 to 22, that youngest generation is facing three really serious challenges, right? One, student debt. It's now up to $1.5 trillion. 29 percent increase in just the last four years. All right, that's one huge one. Second one, it is a fact that their parents are living longer, they have a perception they're going to live longer. So now, I'm thinking about what if I live in to my 80s or 90s. And how do I finance that? Over the course of time. And third is, they are now at point now where they're starting college and thinking about well I need to save for a home someday. I have always competing priorities. So, when you take in those three things, student debt, longevity and competing priorities, they're saying, boy, I hope I get some inheritance to solve this problem. Because I'm really not sure how to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, especially since, I know an 18-year-old is not thinking about their retirement. But they're not getting Social Security, today's 18-year-old, I don't think, now that we know that the Social Security going to be dipping into its trust fund for the first time in 36 years.</p><p>LEVINE: Right. Yes. So, it's really creating a new normal in a lot of ways. In terms of how to redefine retirement. I think we talked about the last time I was on, if you're in your young 20s, you're not sincerely saying at 65 I'm going to have this pot of money and I'm just going to get out of the workforce.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>LEVINE: I think there's a clear view that says, you know, I may continue working, hopefully it's not in the same job I'm in and I have some financial freedom. But the question is, how do I finance that over the course of time versus some lump sum I have to have by a certain age?</p><p>MURPHY: So, Aron, one thing I see as a big change in the landscape, this would be access that the younger generation has to information, it's education. I think 18 to 22-year-olds today are starting to learn more and focus more about their money, about retirement, about what they're going to need. And I think that's a huge benefit to the entire country.</p><p>LEVINE: You're absolutely right. So, I think all those fears that I sort of talked about, that the upside is they're very self-aware and they are actually taking advantage of the access. So they go online, they're starting to educate themselves. And it's our job, places like Merrill Edge and Bank of America to provide that education access and then say, what would you like to do about it? And I think what you're seeing is, that's leading towards where this generation has a kind of profits and purpose mindset. So if I'm going to invest my money, I want to invest in something that's a little more socially conscious. And that's why it's important that all of the industry is delivering those kinds of investment vehicles so that generation can say boy, I do want to invest. I'd love to invest in a company that has a certain sort of moral compass.</p><p>FREEMAN: And so, when you advise Generation Z, step one, do you say OK, your parents by the way are going to live maybe to 100 and by the way, we're looking at the finances of Social Security and Medicare, you're probably on your own.</p><p>LEVINE: Yes, I think the -- hopefully not in your -- on one ways you're not on your own, as you can get some advice and there are ways to reach out. I think what we're trying to do is say, one, you're your self- educated and focus on a plan. Like anything, like, you can't just do it without a very clear plan. So that's what we key on is getting them a life plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, thank you. Good to see you. Aron Levine, Bank of America. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, June 7th.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018060702cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH4-W9G1-JB20-G123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 7, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, June 7.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Markets this morning are higher, take a look.  But that was the high of the  morning, actually.  Futures indicating a gain of about 56 points on the Dow  Industrials; the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are up but just barely, 3 points higher on  the S&amp;P.  This after the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 indexes closed at new  highs again yesterday.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 finished at their highest  levels in three months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Europe this morning, mixed performances, take a look.  It was a rough  start for London this morning.  Trading on the London stock exchange was  delayed this morning due to a technical issue.  The FT 100 is now up just  seven points.  The CAC 40 is up a fraction, a third of a percent and the  DAX index is also higher by a fraction in Germany.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher, take a look, with the  exception of China which was down a fraction.</p><p> Trade tensions -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe headed to the White  House today ahead of the G-7 meeting this weekend.  President Trump at odds  with the other six nations in the G-7 going into the summit over the tariff  and trade policy out of this White House.</p><p> The administration's top official, Larry Kudlow, says this is not a major  fight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LARRY KUDLOW, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR:  I regard this as much  like a family quarrel.  I'm always the optimist.  President Trump is very  clear with respect to his trade reform efforts that we will do what is  necessary to protect the United States, its businesses and its workforce.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest on trade coming up.</p><p> Plus, a high stakes meeting on f Capitol Hill -- Republican lawmakers  coming together to try to hammer out a deal on immigration.  It comes amid  a startling new report on illegal border crossings -- 50,000 people were  arrested just last month.</p><p> An unbelievable scene in Wyoming to show you -- a powerful tornado touching  down in Wyoming.  We've got the very latest.  Look at those pictures.  Wow.</p><p> Meanwhile soaring oil prices set to cost you, airlines are now raising the  price of tickets.  The details coming up.</p><p> And a new twist on bridal bouquets, a pizza parlor now offering  arrangements made of pizza.  But how do you throw it?</p><p> All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to talk  all about it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff Capital CEO  and managing partner Mike Murphy, and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant  editorial page editor James Freeman.  Who would want to catch it if it's  all pizza?</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Well how about maybe just the dough where, you know, you're working on the  dough and then you toss it out to the crowd.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you're in a wedding dress.  </p><p> MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Everyone's  always wanted to do that, right.  Whenever you go in a pizza joint you  always want to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I did it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Oh, very good.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  She can -- this is Maria Bartiromo's wheelhouse  that you just entered.  She can toss dough in the air.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Really.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  We've seen this.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Has this been a segment on the show, yet or -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I did a segment on \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" with my sister when we  made my father's pizza.  </p><p> MURPHY:  We need to do that again, for sure.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, it could be an annual -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  More than annual. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're going to send a camera crew to your house, like when  you're with your family, making pizza.  It would be awesome.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'll show you how to make pizza.</p><p> Look, we've got to get into the story about Iran.  You mentioned it earlier  and what went on in the Obama administration -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- in terms of allowing Iran to have access to the U.S.  financial system.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the President had said as part of his terrible nuclear  deal, don't worry -- he said this to Congress -- I'm not going to let the  Iranians into the U.S. banking system.  That's one sanction I'm not going  to remove.</p><p> Well, they figure out that if they want to give Iran access to billions of  dollars, that Iran wanted it in dollars and then to convert that to euros.   So they decided secretly to issue a license allowing Iran to transact in  the U.S. banking system.</p><p> Well, the plan failed because U.S. banks would not participate.  And I know  over the last decade especially, people have really beaten up on the big  banks.  I've been among those people.  And I think this is a time where  you've got to say hats off to bankers for -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Two major banks said no, we're not doing it.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  And good for them to say no, we're not going to participate  in this secret deal to fund the Ayatollah.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I remember right after the Iranian nuclear deal was inked,  because of the sanctions on U.S. banks, John Kerry took a trip to I think  it was London and met with all these banking heads and all these executives  in the financial system and was trying to encourage them to do business  with Iran -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which would have been illegal.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- literally said we've got restrictions on U.S. banks but you  guys, you can go ahead and start transacting business with Iran because  they were so desperate for the deal to work and for money to get funneled.  </p><p> MURPHY:  Yes.  The banks had regulators they had to answer to -- that's why  they couldn't do it when the President -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they knew -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The banks were afraid of breaking the law.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think we ought to give more credit -- I don't think it  was just compliance.  I think they made the right decision and they  realized the customers wouldn't like this either.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is a big story.  We're going to talk about this about  coming.</p><p> We've got Financial Services Committee member and Wisconsin Congressman  Sean Duffy coming up so we will ask him about that along with Ways and  Means Committee member and New York Congressman Tom Reed.  We'll see what  they think about this whole Iran situation.</p><p> Plus, Murray Energy founder and president and CEO Bob Murray has a thing or  two to say about trade and tariff as well.</p><p> So stay with us on all of that coming up.  Big hour coming up.</p><p> But first this top story and that is trade tensions.  President Trump  meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today ahead of the G-7  meeting and the President's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>Fox News' Doug McKelway is live at the White House this morning with more.   Doug -- good morning to you.  </p><p> DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> And this marks about the start of the President's busiest week since he  assumed office.  It begins this afternoon with the visit of Japanese  President Shinzo Abe who arrives here at 12:00 noon.  The two men are  planning for a joint press conference at 2:00 p.m.</p><p> They have hit it all very well as you well know.  Shinzo Abe was the first  foreign leader to visit the Trump Tower during the transition, later  invited to Mar-A-Lago where the two men enjoyed golf.  They seemed to have  hit it off very, very well.</p><p> No country has a greater interest in reining in North Korea's nuclear  capability than Japan.  That country is truly facing an existential threat  from Kim Jong-un's ballistic missiles.  His meeting with Trump today points  out that the upcoming summit in Singapore is not really a bilateral  meeting, although it is that by name, but that the interest of many  countries -- Japan, South Korea, China, the Pacific Rim countries and many  others -- all have a very important stake in this.</p><p> Complicating the preparations for the summit is the G-7 meeting in Quebec  tomorrow which the President will attend.  It comes amid heated debate over  President Trump's pursuit of more tariffs against Canada, against Mexico,  against the European Union and the President's ban against the Japanese --  excuse me, the Chinese phone company ZTE which has been accused of evading  the ban on sanctions against Iran and North Korea.</p><p> Larry Kudlow was asked about whether there's been a consideration of  lifting the ban on ZTE yesterday.  Here's what he said.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KUDLOW:  No decisions on both sides as of now.  And of course, I refer you  to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce.  But as of this moment, no  decision has been reached by both sides.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCKELWAY:  Trump leaves for the G-7 summit tomorrow.  From there he will  jet off to Singapore where so much is at stake, so much is unknown, and so  many countries are awaiting eagerly to find out what happens and whether  there will be subsequent meetings at all.  </p><p> Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  And we check back as news develops.  Doug -- thank  you.  Doug McKelway there -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- at the White House this morning.</p><p>Facebook fallout -- Senator Ed Markey is calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to  testify before Cngress again following backlash over the social media  company's data partnership with Chinese phone maker Huawei.</p><p> Yesterday, the Senator tweeted this, \"For more than 10 years Facebook has  shared users' personal data with Chinese companies including one with close  ties to the Chinese Communist Party.  I'm calling for Mark Zuckerberg to  come to the Senate and explain how U.S. national security was not  jeopardized.\"</p><p> Here's a look back to what Zuckerberg said during his testimony on the hill  back in April.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake and I'm  sorry.  I started Facebook.  I run it.  And I'm responsible for what  happens here.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is a former mentor to Mark Zuckerberg,  early investor in Facebook certainly, and managing director and co-founder  of Elevation Partners, Roger McNamee here with us.  Roger -- great to see  you.</p><p> ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, ELEVATION PARTNERS:  Always  great to be here -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us. </p><p> So you've previously voiced your concerns over Facebook and the business  model.  How do you feel about the response from Facebook?  Where are we now  on this issue?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  We're nowhere near the end, unfortunately.  The company had this  model for years called \"move fast and break things\".  The notion was don't  let anything get in the way of growth.</p><p> The reality is it was really \"move fast, break things, apologize and then  move on\" as though nothing has happened.  And that's really where Mark is  now.  He's apologizing because every rock we turn over has another scandal  hidden underneath it.</p><p> And this one in China, we don't know exactly how bad it is.  What we know,  though, is that Facebook was not monitoring these companies.  And if the  Defense Department is telling us they won't buy Huawei products because  they're afraid of bugging and hacking, I think we have to be concerned that  Huawei with 10 years or whatever of control of Facebook user accounts is  going to have had the opportunity to download all that data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think this is one of the biggest stories of our time,  frankly.  When you look at China and what has occurred and the fact that  there's this massive technology transfer going on, where China acquires  American companies, forces the transfer of technology and then you see  Facebook, it's not the technology or secrets but it's all their user data.  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  And Mark has worked so hard to try to get in the good graces of  the Chinese government in order to have the opportunity to participate  there -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's the thing though, yes.</p><p> MCNAMEE:  -- and so I do not find their response even remotely comforting,  because their practice has been deny, deny, deny and then only admit to the  bare minimum when they're forced to.  And the situation here is they  weren't paying attention.  They have no idea what these guys did and they  had years to mess with this data.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And there are other technology companies that wanted a  foothold in China but would not adhere to China rules, in terms of forcing  the technology.  Look at Google.</p><p> By the way, Google now reportedly bracing for a fine of up to $11 billion  following an anti-trust issue in the European Union.  That of course,  investigation into the company according to the \"Financial Times\" is coming  to a head.  This would be the second major penalty for Google coming from  the European competition regulators.</p><p> What's going on in terms of regulation within tech?  We're just at the  beginning of this.  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  We are.  And it's really important that we have some threat of  regulation because the companies have done a terrible job of self- regulation.  I mean, they have been given all the room in the world to  manage themselves and yet we've clearly seen one disaster after another.</p><p> And the issues that Google faces in Europe are not unique to Google.   Amazon has competitive issues in many markets around the world.  Facebook  is clearly behaving like a monopolist around the world.  And as a  consequence, regulators I think are appropriately worried that the  entrepreneurial economy, especially in this country, is being stifled.</p><p> These guys are blocking the new startups from getting going.  They're  really limiting the rate of innovation in this country.  And that's not the  American way.  The American way is we let a thousand flowers bloom.  We let  entrepreneur create new things.</p><p> And these guys can be really successful without blocking every new thing  that comes along.  And it's important for regulators to make that point and  find ways to constrain them so that we can have this kind of economy that  really supports jobs all across America.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are there other companies out there that are also selling the  data right now that we don't even know about?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  I assume so.  In fact, I think you have to assume that whatever  data you had that was in one of these systems has been compromised  somewhere.  The only company that has made a strategy of protecting your  data is Apple and even there I don't think you can feel 100 percent safe.   But you're going to feel much safer there.</p><p> The worst offenders on this have been the Android operating system that  Google owns and Facebook.  Both of which have been so porous that frankly,  you just have to assume everything has been compromised.</p><p> And so that's why when regulators look at this, the important thing to look  at is to protect users from inappropriate usage of their data going forward  -- there's no way to get the data back.  So what you have to do is place  restrictions on how it's used.  We have to be given control over what any  company does with the data that they have.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's that.  There's also the issue of conservative ideas  being crushed, being, you know, eliminated.  So we had Kevin McCarthy on  the show recently, the majority leader, he said that.  That, you know,  these companies are editing the information that we all see.  We had Devin  Nunes, the chairman of the Intel Committee Sunday who said the same thing.  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  There's no question that they edit like crazy.  But I think the  perception they edit one side more than the other is not actually correct.   I think what's going on is that these companies are not transparent.  We  have no idea what they're doing when they edit.</p><p> I think in reality, what they're doing is creating what is known as a  filter bubble around each person.  They give each person what that person  wants and their idea of what that person wants may or may not be correct.   But their notion is they give you your preferences all the time and  reinforce that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But you saw the story last week where if you typed in GOP in  California, you pulled up a list of ideologies on Google and one of them  was Nazism.  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  No, no, no.  That kind of stuff is -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How does that happen -- Roger?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  The answer is this stuff is totally automated and these people  have no idea, right.  They're trying to sell ads.  They're not worried  about truth.  They're not worried about fact.  They're worried about  engagement.  They're worried about their revenue.  They want to give you  what they think you want.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now they can be worried -- </p><p> MCNAMEE:  They obviously thought somebody wanted to know the party  sentiment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now they're going to have to worry about regulation.  I mean  Devin Nunes said look -- </p><p> MCNAMEE:  They should have to worry about regulation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- if somebody doesn't come in the free market and do what  Google does and make sure to promise us that they're not going to be  editing things like this, then it's fine.  If not, we're going to have to  look at this as if they're monopolies.  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  You have to look that way.  Now, I think it's about time people  started to look at them that way.  The right answer in the short run is to  force them to have a button at the top that gives you a choice of view.   You can give me what you think I want.  But I want to be able to see an  unfiltered view as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.</p><p> MCNAMEE:  Ok.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick -- would you put money into this sector today?  Do  you want to buy any of these stocks?  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  I don't want to buy any of them.  I own -- I still own some  Facebook, I still own Apple, I still own Amazon.  I would not -- I think  we're very late in the market cycle.  I think rates are still rising.   There's a lot of uncertainty on global trade and the tech industry's really  sensitive to global trade.</p><p> So I think it looks good relative to the market but I'm nervous about the  market.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You are so good.  How's the band going?  Moonalice?</p><p> MCNAMEE:  Awesome -- playing a lot of rock and roll.  It's summertime.   Moonalice.com for anybody who wants to check it out.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You are my rock and roll mentor.  Roger -- good to see you.  </p><p> MCNAMEE:  Always great to see you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Roger McNamee.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  welcome back.</p><p>Las Vegas police releasing 9-1-1 calls from the deadliest mass shooting in  modern U.S. history.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details now and headlines -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  They're tough to listen to -- Maria.</p><p> You hear things like panic, you hear fear, you hear the desperation in  these voices; as you said, Las Vegas police releasing these 9-1-1 calls  eight months after the mass shooting.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  My friend just got shot.  We need an ambulance.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We have three gunshot wounds and I have no idea where  we re.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You need an ambulance.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  And there's so many calls to listen to, folks.  Authorities also  releasing this video from surveillance cameras that show people frantically  fleeing the scene.  The gunfire came from the 32nd floor windows of the  Mandalay Bay Resort; 58 people were killed that night.</p><p> Well, incredible video of a powerful tornado touching down in Wyoming last  night.  The National Weather Service said the tornado was on the ground for  at least 45 minutes.  Some brave people heading outside, snapping photos of  the monstrous twister -- brave or maybe just crazy, I don't know.</p><p> You can see the massive thunderstorm that sparked the tornado hovering  above.  No word yet if there was any damage or injuries but incredible  pictures.</p><p> Well, a more than 50 percent jump in fuel cost is hitting air travelers  right in the wallet as airlines start to raise their fares.  Delta Airlines  cutting its profit forecast for the year, adding it could take anywhere  from six months to a year to make up for increase fuel costs.  United  Airlines also expected to raise ticket prices very soon.  Shares of Delta  Airlines are down about 3 percent this year.  United Continental up about 4  percent.</p><p> Ok, here's something a little more fun.  For a bride to chew on as she  walks down the aisle, who doesn't want this?  Via Italian Kitchen  announcing this week couples tying the knot this summer could enter to win  an exclusive pizza bouquet and they get a boutonniere.</p><p> They claim it's going to be the first ever of its kind.  I think that's  true.  Entries have to be in by June 15th.  Win or lose, entrants will  receive a coupon for a free slice of pizza.  But for the pizza-loving  bride, Maria -- hey, why not girls do it.  Go for it.  Fully support it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> Coming up -- the battle over immigration.  House Republicans meet for  crucial negotiations today on border control, just as a startling new  report says illegal border crossings had hit 50,000 in the month of May.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> The GOP getting ready for a crucial debate on immigration later today;  there are stark divisions within the Republican conference.  This, as the  DHS Reports that border arrests have exceeded 50,000 just for the month of  May.  And this is the third month in a row that they've exceeded 50,000.</p><p> Here now, Republican Congressman Tom Reed of New York, a member of the  House Ways and Means Committee, who has signed a discharge petition which  could force votes on immigration.  Congressman -- good to see you, Thanks  so much for joining us.</p><p> REP. TOM REED (R-NY), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  Thanks for having me  on -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why did you do that?  You need to force a decision on  immigration because it's so in the background at this point.  </p><p> REED:  This has been going on for months.  This is now seven months into  this issue of resolving it, not just for the Dreamers and these kids that  are caught up in a broken immigration system, but more fundamentally to  secure our borders and get this wall and structures constructed to secure  the border so we're starting to fix the problem.</p><p> And this discharge petition is just going to have an open debate on four  bills that will say let's go on record, put the position of the House out  there so that we can then go with the senate and see if we can get to the  White House to sign this and start legislating for the people back home.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Congressman -- the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark  Meadows sounded hopeful on the debate.  Here's what he said yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS:  We're still not in a  situation where there's an agreement.  I think there is great progress  that's being made.  Hopefully what we'll see is the objections get smaller  and less of hurdle in the hours to come.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what are the hurdles -- Congressman?  Because, you know, at  the same time, you also hear Mitch McConnell saying this is never getting  anywhere before the midterm elections.  </p><p> REED:  Well, I'm glad to hear that type of conversation.  And I think this  petition is forcing and leveraging the pressure that is necessary to  finally say let's get this done.  And some of the issues that are out there  is what is the path for potential citizenship for the Dreamers, how much  money will go into the wall?  How much money will go into technology?  But  those are issues that we can work out and should have worked out months  ago.  But now we're getting to the point where it will get resolved because  they have no other option because the clock is ticking.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So let me switch gears here because we're waiting on the IG  report.  Jim Comey apparently defied authority when he was the FBI  director.  That's what we understand is in the IG report.  Does this chip  away at credibility there?  What are you expecting in terms of the  inspector general report which is forthcoming -- we expect this week.  </p><p> REED:  Well, first of all, absolutely it chips away at Mr. Comey's  credibility.  And remember who the IG is.  This is essentially the internal  affairs, the police of the police if you would, whose job is not to conduct  a political investigation but to hold accountable our government officials  such as James Comey to say look, I'm going to call balls and strikes here.</p><p> And that they are clearly saying and the information I'm hearing is  troublesome.  You acted insubordinate, in an insubordinate manner.  And at  the end of the day, when you have your FBI director doing that, we should  learn from it, we should hold people accountable and move forward in a  stronger fashion.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Congressman -- hi, James Freeman with the \"Wall Street Journal\".   We've been talking about the revelations this week that in order to  facilitate the Iran nuclear deal, President Obama secretly sought to give  Iran the ability to transact through the American financial system in order  to get frozen assets converted into dollars and then euros.</p><p> Does this -- does this change the politics in terms of how people on  Capitol Hill view the President's decision to abandon that deal?  Or is  this kind of a partisan rut where it doesn't have much impact?  </p><p> REED:  I hope it does.  But it definitely illustrates what I've been saying  all along about the Iranian deal.  That was, President Obama's  administration saying they were out of time, they needed to cut a deal,  they wanted to put this win up on the board.  And they were willing to  negotiate everything away in order to get the Iranian deal signed into law  in my humble opinion.</p><p> And this is yet just another sign of how they were doing that and trying to  move the ball for political deadlines rather than what we should be  focusing on, is substance of a deal that is going to keep nuclear weapons  out of the hands of Iranians.</p><p> And now what has happened is the President has gone forward in a leadership  role to say we're going to hold these guys accountable.  We're not going to  honor a deal that was done in a hasty manner in order to achieve some type  of deadline because they were leaving the White House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good for those banks to push back and say we're not going do  it.  </p><p> REED:  Amen.  Thank God they did.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want -- I want to add one thing, Congressman -- in terms  of it was almost as if American banks and even businesses knew that this  was a bad deal from the start.  </p><p> REED:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And would not step up because, again, you had just myriad  businesses in Europe immediately beginning to transact business with Iran  after this deal was done, oh so anxiously going into that country.  You did  not have that in the United States.</p><p>Boeing is kind of one of the only examples that we can cite of inking a  deal with Iran.  So it wasn't just the banks.  It was scores of other  companies.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  It's a great point.  And this is why we have a process for  treaties where people in this country, people overseas -- they understand  it's a real agreement.  The United States has made a decision.</p><p> President Obama didn't do that.  He basically got around the need for a  treaty.  They had this cheap maneuver in the Congress -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  For the U.N.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, good for American businesses and banks in this case saying  this isn't going to fly and it won't fly with our customer.  </p><p> REED:  And if I could add, a great point, and that is why when President  Trump did this with the Iranian deal, it squarely is going to put American  businesses as well as European businesses, who are you going to side with?   The Iranians or America?</p><p> And that is going to be further leveraged to say I know where people will  want to do business. That's with us as proud Americans.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- real quick before you go.  Are you going to do  phase two of the tax cut plan before the midterms?  </p><p> REED:  We're definitely moving forward on the committee.  We're drafting  that.  We're working on it, having conversations.  And we want to do it.   We want to protect those individuals and make this code permanent for  individuals as well as the expensing provisions for businesses across the  country.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you think that will be something we'll see before the  midterms?  </p><p> REED:  I do believe so.  We're on track to get that done and that's exactly  where I think we're going to land.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- good to see you sir.  Thank you.</p><p> REED:  Thanks for having us on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tom Reed joining us there.</p><p> Coming up, the power of big tech -- the Nasdaq and the Russell 2000 hitting  record highs, boosted by the technology sector.  We're taking at look at  how long this rally can last. </p><p> Then bottoms up at Wal-Mart -- the retailer going upscale with wine at  bargain prices.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Welcome back.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  It is Thursday, June 7th.  Your top  stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> It is looking like a mixed picture for markets at the opening of trading  this morning.  Take a look at Futures indicating a gain of 70 points on the  Dow Jones Industrial average.  This right here, this is the high of the  morning, Dow industrials up 70, S&amp;P and NASDAQ are up just a fraction.  But  it is -- the Dow that's really going to be the splash.  Yesterday it was a  record-breaker for the NASDAQ and the Russell meanwhile.  The Russell 2000  Index and the NASDAQ hitting all-time highs while the Dow and S&amp;P 500  closed the day at their highest levels in three months.  Take a look at  those numbers, pretty strong performance.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, mixed story.  London's trading day got off to a  late start.  The market got hit by a rare technical glitch delaying the  open.  The FT-100 is up 20 points right now, the CAC Quarante and DAX index  are higher by a quarter of a percent at this hour.  </p><p> In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher as you can see there, with  the exception of China.  Shang Hai Composite was down a fraction.  </p><p> Coming up, more Americans banking on the big inheritance (INAUDIBLE) to  secure their future.  We'll take a look at this trend and how we're  investing it.</p><p> Starbucks customers, getting awakening this morning.  A cup of coffee just  got more expensive.  How much it is going to cost you for your cup of Joe  every morning now?  </p><p> Jessica Alba wants to take her Honest Company global.  The consumer goods  company just got the big bucks to back it up.  We've got the details.</p><p> And why Wal-Mart's bargain thirsty shoppers will soon be drinking up wine  at a discount.  </p><p> Plus this, lady gaga hitting the stage in the first trailer for the highly  anticipated \"A Star is Born.\"  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LADY GAGA, SINGER AND ACTRESS, AS ALLY:  No, I can't do that.  </p><p> BRADLEY COOPER, ACTOR, AS JACKSON MAINE:  You're coming, here we go.  </p><p> GAGA:  Jack, Jack, please, it's not funny.  Jack.</p><p> COOPER:  Look at me.  All you got to do is trust me.  That's all you got to  do. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's sneak peek, already sparking Oscar buzz online.  We've  got more for you coming up.  </p><p> But first, this top story this half an hour, big tech continues to power  the markets.  The NASDAQ, the Russell 2000 index hitting at record highs  and the S&amp;P is not far behind.  Joining us right now is the chief  investment officer at Federated Investors, who just throw in there $15  billion in (INAUDIBLE) management, Stephen Auth is with us.  Stephen, good  to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> STEPHEN AUTH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Thanks for  having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're fully invested here.  </p><p> AUTH:  Well, pretty close.  Yes, we think that the market's heading higher.   The consensus I -- the consensus really is that we're going to roll over as  we approach the peak from back in early January and I think people think  we're late cycle.  Market's expensive.  We think we're not late cycle.  We  don't think the market's expensive.  And we're heading into an earnings  season, probably going to be the best earnings season in almost a decade.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We just came off of a great earnings season.  26 percent profit  growth.</p><p> AUTH:  We did.  And this one's even going to be better.  You know, earnings  will be up about 20 percent.  And we're only weeks away now.  And I think  that's the next focus on the market.  I think when once we power through  the January highs, you know, technically you could have the market head  considerably higher.  </p><p> MURPHY:  And Steve, you pointed out that a lot of people are not bullish  this market, you know, they're giving a lot of reasons why the market  should roll over here.  And having been through 2000 and been through 2008,  but prior to those two periods you had everybody sell your house, invest in  the market.</p><p> AUTH:  Right.</p><p> MURPHY:  Everybody was uber bullish.  Whereas now, I feel the consensus is  very negative which I think is a great opportunity for the market because  the earnings are really showing real growth in certain sectors.  </p><p> AUTH:  Yes, it's really funny, we've got this great fundamental backdrop,  yet the overall consensus is very cautious.  I put out a piece a couple of  weeks, I called the five myths.  And to me, you know, talking a lot to  investors, there's this belief that what goes up must come down, that we're  late cycle.  That the market's over expensive.  And it's just, we're not.   We're not late cycle.  If you look at where we are.  The expansion -- the  average expansion in this cycle per year is about 2.1 percent.  Whereas  most economic expansions would be more than double that.  You could argue - - you know, in time it's been long.  But in distance it hasn't been.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the age of it, like we're on our tenth year right now.  </p><p> AUTH:  Yes, people are worried about the age.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why we're bringing it up, that's what skeptics bring up.  </p><p> AUTH:  I think age is potentially a good thing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Age is just a number.  Come on. </p><p> AUTH:  Absolutely.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Whatever you are is the new 30.  30 I'm wondering with the --  with the stocks, you're saying they're not expensive.  So, I thin  traditional analysis, you look at trailing earnings and you say, wow,  that's expensive.  You look at forward earnings it looks kind of  reasonable.  </p><p> AUTH:  Right.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Is there a specific yardstick you use to say stocks are cheap,  stocks are not cheap? </p><p> AUTH:  Well, our yardstick is we look forward.  We try to analyze the  fundamentals of where we're heading.  And people have been saying this  market's expensive all the way up and it's mostly because they're looking  at trailing numbers.  But on a -- on a forward basis, this market is not  expensive.  And on individual stocks it's not expensive.  I mean, some of  the stocks we like, you mentioned some of the tech stocks, like Facebook as  an example.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You like that?  </p><p> AUTH:  Yes, stock's trading in, 24 times next year's earnings.  That's not  expensive.  Particularly with the --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not compared to Amazon.  </p><p> AUTH:  Probably understated, yes, not compared to Amazon, Apple's 16 times,  J.P. Morgan stock we like, it's trading at 13 times.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Wait, why do you say Facebook's earnings are understated? What  does that mean? </p><p> AUTH:  Well, if you look at the traditional accounting in this country,  based on widget production basically, right?  So, when you invest in a  factory, you get to expense that over two decades.  But if you're investing  in tech and data, its immediate expensed.  But there's assets on the  balance sheets of companies like Facebook that are not even on the --  they're off-balance sheet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well they're not monetizing WhatsApp, they're not monetizing  the Messenger.  </p><p> AUTH:  Yes, all this data has enormous value.  And it's not showing up on  the balance sheets, they're already been expensed and in fact the  acquisition of it hasn't been.  So, you know, if you look on a cash flow  basis, these companies are generating enormous amounts of cash flow.  </p><p> MURPHY:  How much harder is your job right now?  Because the velocity of  change, with new technology coming out, you know, you have a company going  from a start-up, early stage company to a multibillion dollar company in a  couple of years.  Does that make your job and analyzing and valuing these  companies that much harder?</p><p> AUTH:  I think in general investing in stocks has become more and more  difficult.  At the same time, more and more investors have just gone  passive and that's what creates the great opportunity for the active  manager and active managers have now been outperforming the last 12 to 18  months.  There's so much money in the market that just -- is blindly  investing.  In some ways, it makes our job a little bit easier in effect.   But yes, I mean, is the complexity high? That's what you're exploring on  the show every morning.  It's gotten more and more complex.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> AUTH:  It is a complex world.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But even looking back 10 years, are investors still shaken from  the financial crisis and overinvested in fixed income, thinking that fixed  income, particularly treasuries -- longer term treasuries are some sort of  haven, is that the real concern here? </p><p> AUTH:  Well, I think --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, we're staring at a bear market for something, right?</p><p> AUTH:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's either, it's going to be equities or -- </p><p> AUTH:  I mean, you're half full, half empty.  But I would say that the half  full element here and one of our thesis for what we call the secular bull.   We think we're in this long cycle secular bull is just that, the base of  this expansion is the worst economic crisis since really the great  depression and every economic actor out there has been negatively affected  by this and they all think sooner or later it's going to roll over.  Even  the regulators.  So they've been very kind to this market as a result.  So  when everyone's expecting something to happen, that's usually doesn't  happen.  And that's why stocks we think are still undervalued.  Is there a  bubble in bonds? We're not a believer of that.  We think bond yields are  low for a reason and we think they're going to grind higher but we only  anticipate -- and certainly if we had a big selloff in bonds, that would  hurt equities for sure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, the Federal Reserve meeting next week,  you're expecting the Fed to raise interest rates?  </p><p> AUTH:  Well, me and everyone else.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And everybody else?</p><p> AUTH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  Let's just talk about this for a second, during the break  we were talking about and noticing some of this price increases, the price  of coffee, Starbucks coffee's going up, airline tickets are going up.  What  else did we say? </p><p> MUROHY:  Gas.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Gasoline prices are going up.  Is inflation an issue?  How does  the Fed deal with that?  And what does the markets do as rates starts going  higher? </p><p> AUTH:  So, some things are going up.  But there's a lot of stuff not going  up.  Price of diapers isn't going up.  Most staples the prices are not  going up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p> AUTH:  But there's not a lot of pricing power.  And you've got the Amazon  effect out there, literally with the Gatling gun on top of the mountain  top, waiting for anyone to volunteer there here (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right -- you're right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I'll throw it at you this way.  Maybe consumers aren't  getting those price increases passed along, that inflation, but it is  hitting businesses.  Steel prices even before these tariffs go into effect  are up 40 percent in the United States year-to-date or were through the end  of last week, even more year over year.  You have freight costs going up  and Cisco, the food company is saying our costs have gone up.  We can't  pass them under our customers.  That hits profit margins.  So, is that a  concern if you own stocks?  </p><p> AUTH:  Yes, Dagen, we're about to produce a 20 percent year over year  quarterly gains in earnings in the upcoming quarter.  So yes, cost  pressures are affecting some companies and active investors like us, we're  very carefully watching which companies don't have enough pricing power or  aren't.  But there's other ways to offset commodity price increases as you  get productivity.  You get a corporate tax cut and maybe you use some of  that money to pay your workers a little --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the trade issue?  Are you worried about the trade  issue, aluminum and steel tariffs, China fight?  </p><p> AUTH:  No.  We're trying to get free and fair trade.  I mean, you've been  talking about this on the show.  But we just see that as a powerful  negotiation.  The president has most of the cards.  He's a very good  negotiator.  And you go into China, the good cops go in there, Kudlow and - -</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Mnuchin.</p><p> AUTH:  Mnuchin, right?  And they say look, here's the deal.  You guys are  shipping $500 billion to us a year.  We're shipping you 120.  We want that  number to change.  You've got to take down some of your barriers so we can  ship more to you.  Give us $200 billion or the bad cops are going to be  over here, Navarro, etcetera.  That's what's going on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, you know what?  I'm so glad you're here.  Because this  was the top of our show.  This was the first words we said.  Dagen brought  this up at the top of the show saying, why we're all worried about all this  trade stuff and look at the markets new record highs.  This is why.   Stephen Auth just told us the sentiments of Wall Street.  </p><p> AUTH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're not buying it.  You think this is all a negotiation.   You just want a better trade deal.  </p><p> AUTH:  And you know, a month ago we were talking about do the Chinese cheat  or not?  Now we're talking about how much is it?  You know, we're up to $80  billion, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> AUTH:  Well OK, that's not going to work.  But we'll carry, the bid ask is  now 8200.  I couldn't find a number.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, the last time I check, $300 billion cost, to the theft of  intellectual property a year? </p><p> FREEMAN:  You're saying basically you think these larger problems are going  to be pushed aside.  I don't think this is progress that the government  says we're now going to set numbers for imports and exports.  Is it? </p><p> AUTH:  Look, to me the press is hysterical about this and if you think  about it, all the president wants is free and fair trade.  The tariffs is a  cajole he's using to negotiate better terms.   BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> AUTH:  The rest of the world, we're dealing with an entitlement here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> AUTH:  Even our so-called allies in Europe.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> AUTH:  We rebuilt the world after World War II.  We gave them all these  deals.  And now we're saying end of the entitlements.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And yesterday Kudlow called the tariffs a tool.  There you go.</p><p> AUTH:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephen, good to see you.  </p><p> AUTH:  Likewise.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Stephen Auth joining us, Federated  Investors.</p><p> Coming up, get ready to pay more for your coffee.  You just heard it.   Starbucks is raising prices again.  We'll tell you how much.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  welcome back.  Starbucks hiking the cost of your morning cup of  coffee again.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  OK, this is going to get expensive, Maria.  Starbucks fans are  going to have to dig a bit deeper for the cup of Joe in the morning.  The  company raising prices between $00.10 and $00.20 on all sizes of its brewed  coffee in most of its stores here in the U.S.  Starbucks blaming the move  on the nine percent increase in operating expenses for the first half of  its fiscal year.  That's compared to last year.  Starbucks shares are down  less than one percent so far this year.  </p><p> Well, Jessica Alba's Honest Company receiving a fresh round of funding.   The company is getting a $200 million investment from private equity firm L  Catterton.  The Honest says, that the new investment is going to help  expand its business globally, increase product supply and funds of  innovation.  The company has not disclosed the size of the stake that L  Catterton is actually going to receive in all of this.  </p><p> Well, bargain hunters can now grab a fancy bottle of wine at Wal-Mart.  The  company trying to appeal to more upscale tastes, launching its own wine  label called Wine Makers Selection.  Customers are going to be able to buy  10 fine wines from California, France and Italy.  Retailing for about  $11.00 a bottle.  The retailer says the wine will be higher quality than  other brands of wine that it actually currently sells.  This puts them of  course in direct competition with their rival Costco.  Costco's got its own  private wine label.  Shares of Wal-Mart down 14 percent this year.  Costco  shares are up six percent.  </p><p> And then I'm so excited about this, Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are  teaming up for the fourth rendition of a \"Star Is Born\" and Oscar buzz is  already swirling.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> COOPER:  Do you write songs or anything? </p><p> GAGA:  I don't sing my own songs.  </p><p> COOPER:  Why? </p><p> GAGA:  I just don't feel comfortable.  </p><p> COOPER:  Why wouldn't you feel comfortable? </p><p> GAGA:  Almost every single person has told me they like the way I sound,  but they don't like the way I look.  </p><p> COOPER:  I think you're beautiful.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Bradley Cooper is directing Lady Gaga's feature debut as a  Hollywood lead.  Cooper plays an aging performer who takes a shy, talented  young singer played of course by, Lady Gaga.  Under his wing, she of course  brings her musical expertise to the film.  There's a slew of original songs  for this one.  She wrote a handful of them with Cooper and other artists  like Mark Ronson and Willie Nelson's son, Lukas.  \"A Star is Born\" hits  theaters October 5th.  I was actually looking at the trailer last night.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow that really does look good.  I'm looking forward to it too.  </p><p> CASONE:  Her songs are incredible on this.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just real quick, she's going to be compared to Janet Gaynor,  Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand who all played this role.  So, that's  what she will be compared to.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, so, you're saying --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She's awesome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  High expectation.  Coming up, windfall as the pathway to  wealth, we'll tell you why a third of Americans are banking on an  inheritance to shore up their financial futures.  Are you one of them,  next. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More Americans are relying on their parents for  money, that's according to a new report from Merrill Edge that finds one in  three Americans are relying on an inheritance for financial stability.   Joining us right now in a FOX Business Exclusive is Bank of America Merrill  Edge head Aron Levine.  Good to see you, Aron.  Thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p> ARON LEVINE, MERRILL EDGE HEAD, BANK OF AMERICA:  Hey, good to see you  again.  Thank you so much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, this survey finds that number jumping to 63 percent.</p><p> LEVINE:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  When narrowed down between generation z or those aged between  18 and 22.  Tell us about it.  </p><p> LEVINE:  Yes, you think about that 18 to 22, that youngest generation is  facing three really serious challenges, right?  One, student debt.  It's  now up to $1.5 trillion.  29 percent increase in just the last four years.   All right, that's one huge one.  Second one, it is a fact that their  parents are living longer, they have a perception they're going to live  longer.  So now, I'm thinking about what if I live in to my 80s or 90s.   And how do I finance that?  Over the course of time.  And third is, they  are now at point now where they're starting college and thinking about well  I need to save for a home someday.  I have always competing priorities.   So, when you take in those three things, student debt, longevity and  competing priorities, they're saying, boy, I hope I get some inheritance to  solve this problem.  Because I'm really not sure how to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, especially since, I know an 18-year-old is not thinking  about their retirement.  But they're not getting Social Security, today's  18-year-old, I don't think, now that we know that the Social Security going  to be dipping into its trust fund for the first time in 36 years.  </p><p> LEVINE:  Right. Yes.  So, it's really creating a new normal in a lot of  ways.  In terms of how to redefine retirement.  I think we talked about the  last time I was on, if you're in your young 20s, you're not sincerely  saying at 65 I'm going to have this pot of money and I'm just going to get  out of the workforce.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> LEVINE:  I think there's a clear view that says, you know, I may continue  working, hopefully it's not in the same job I'm in and I have some  financial freedom.  But the question is, how do I finance that over the  course of time versus some lump sum I have to have by a certain age?  </p><p> MURPHY:  So, Aron, one thing I see as a big change in the landscape, this  would be access that the younger generation has to information, it's  education.  I think 18 to 22-year-olds today are starting to learn more and  focus more about their money, about retirement, about what they're going to  need.  And I think that's a huge benefit to the entire country.  </p><p> LEVINE:  You're absolutely right.  So, I think all those fears that I sort  of talked about, that the upside is they're very self-aware and they are  actually taking advantage of the access.  So they go online, they're  starting to educate themselves.  And it's our job, places like Merrill Edge  and Bank of America to provide that education access and then say, what  would you like to do about it?  And I think what you're seeing is, that's  leading towards where this generation has a kind of profits and purpose  mindset.  So if I'm going to invest my money, I want to invest in something  that's a little more socially conscious.  And that's why it's important  that all of the industry is delivering those kinds of investment vehicles  so that generation can say boy, I do want to invest.  I'd love to invest in  a company that has a certain sort of moral compass.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  And so, when you advise Generation Z, step one, do you say OK,  your parents by the way are going to live maybe to 100 and by the way,  we're looking at the finances of Social Security and Medicare, you're  probably on your own.  </p><p> LEVINE:  Yes, I think the -- hopefully not in your -- on one ways you're  not on your own, as you can get some advice and there are ways to reach  out.  I think what we're trying to do is say, one, you're your self- educated and focus on a plan.  Like anything, like, you can't just do it  without a very clear plan.  So that's what we key on is getting them a life  plan.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you.  Good to see you.  Aron Levine, Bank of  America.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Thank you so  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.

The question is how far we can go,\" the source told the news agency AFP.Chinese rumblingsHowever, the US treasury secretary is also expected to use the meeting to win consensus on how to combat China's trade practices. Apart from higher tariffs on global steel producers, Washington is reportedly also weighing broader anti-China tariffs and investment restrictions as part of a US intellectual property probe launched last year.US plans to impose punitive tariffs worth $60 billion on Chinese products from the IT, telecoms and consumer products sectors, have raised worries that retaliation from Beijing could unleash a tit-for-tat trade war choking off global trade and growth.Read more: US trade groups warn against higher tariffsAlready Beijing has warned that there will be \"no winner\" in a trade war between the world's two largest economies. \"[A trade war] can only harm others and hurt oneself,\" Chinese ForeignMinistry spokesman Lu Kang said Friday. \"I believe there is no doubt about this, and we should not take any chances.\"Obsolete agendaThe looming trade war is likely to eclipse other burning issues on the G20 agenda, including the taxation of the world's tech giants. The \"tax optimization\" practices of the likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are regularly a source of friction between the US and its allies.But while G20 members Britain, France, Germany and Italy are pushing for a revenue-based tax on the US tech giants, Washington has said it \"firmly opposes\" any new tax on big tech.The EU unveiled a proposal last week that would tax technology companies somewhere between two percent and five percent, based on overall revenue in the EU and not just on profits.Read more: EU prepares revenue-based tax on US tech giantsDuring the meeting, the ministers were also expected to discuss greater regulatory oversight of so-called cryptocurrencies, which some see as necessary given the huge fluctuations in the value of bitcoin and other digital currencies in recent months.Communication differencesDespite major differences over global trade, the draft of the final communique doesn't mention the word protectionism. Instead, it includes a warning to countries not to \"retreat to inward looking policies.\"But several G20 officials, including the finance ministers from host country Argentina and Germany, said they would insist on maintaining G20 communique language emphasizing \"the crucial role of the rules-based international trading system.\"\"We note the importance of bilateral, regional and plurilateral agreements being open, transparent, inclusive and WTO-consistent, and commit to working to ensure they complement the multilateral trade agreements,\" reads the phrase they want so see included. But it's unclear whether that language will stand.At the first G20 meeting in Germany about a year ago, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pressed the group to drop a decades-old pledge \"to resist all forms of protectionism.\" This was replaced with a watered-down pledge to \"strengthen the contribution of trade to our economies.\"uhe/jd (Reuters, AFP, dpa) </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099911521481311887251763700253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7829</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX3-J461-JCMN-Y2TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><timeReceived>5:41 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Deutsche Welle Business</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 19, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001959</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001673</classCode><className>TARIFFS &amp;

It is selling products not manufactured elsewhere. It can charge whatever price the market will bear.''</p><p>Silicon Valley's ties to the global economy were ominously underscored earlier this week when a plunge in China's stocks sent a shudder through global markets that hammered the shares of the valley's big tech companies.</p><h>Export-oriented</h><p>Silicon Valley is ``one of the most, if not the most, export-oriented economies'' in the nation, observed Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. ``We are tied to foreign trade. That is one of the reasons we were able to do well last year, and will do well this year and next year, despite a slowing in the U.S.''</p><p>The region views globalization much differently than many traditional manufacturers and farming sectors, which often see their industries undercut by lower-priced overseas competitors. While tech companies can be hurt by the policies of other countries, such as their failure to crack down on tech piracy, they gain from setting up overseas plants in lower-cost regions.</p><p>They also locate offices overseas to help gain entry into foreign markets. That means companies with operations in China, for instance, benefit from the communist government's policy of preventing its currency from rising, said Clyde Prestowitz, author of ``Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East,'' and a member of Intel's policy advisory committee.</p><p>Congressional Democrats are considering punitive legislation directed at China because of its alleged currency manipulations and disregard for anti-piracy protections. That could help some U.S. companies but could hurt the valley's tech giants doing business in China.</p><p>``The spillover effect is hard to quantify, but it doesn't help,'' said Frederick Mayer, a Duke University professor and trade expert who worked on the North American Free Trade Agreement as a staffer for Sen. Bill Bradley in the 1990s.</p><p>U.S. trade relations with South Korea also could get bumpy. Current negotiations for a free-trade deal with that Asian tiger economy could be derailed by U.S. demands that Korea lower trade barriers that block the sale of U.S. autos and other goods.</p><p>``We favor a trade deal with Korea because it could mean better access for IT products there, but it could be held up by auto and pharmaceutical issues,'' said Rob Mulligan, senior vice president of AeA, which represents electronics companies.</p><p>The Korea negotiations illustrate how trade has become a hot political issue. Yet, it remains unclear how hard Democrats will push for trade reform. In November, 90 House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, voted for a trade deal with Vietnam, and 94 opposed it. The agreement passed 228-161.</p><p>``Democrats are not unified, and somehow they need to reach for a progressive trade policy that's feasible -- one that other countries can agree to -- and that's very difficult,'' Duke's Mayer said.</p><p>Nonetheless, many Democratic leaders have called for ``fair trade'' rather than free trade, a code phrase for trade negotiations that ensure a ``level playing field.'' That includes blocking access to the U.S. market for goods made overseas in plants where workers toil in poor conditions and receive substandard wages. Fair-trade advocates also call for retaliation against countries with unfair barriers to U.S. exports.</p><h>Korea concerns</h><p>John Edwards, a Democratic presidential candidate, called on the Bush administration to shut down trade talks with Korea until that country ``proves its willingness to open their market to American autos and other products.''</p><p>In a December Washington Post opinion piece, Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, wrote: ``We must insist that all trade agreements have labor, environmental and other protections so that American workers can compete on a level playing field. The American market is the most desirable in the world. Every country wants access to it. That gives us a great deal of leverage, if only we'd use it. Barriers to U.S. products overseas should not be tolerated.''</p><p>Many valley execs support at least some of the criticisms of current trade policies. Tech companies in the valley are willing to embrace stricter labor and environmental conditions for foreign workers, said Gary Fazzino, Hewlett-Packard's vice president of government policy.</p><p>``I'm very much in favor of free trade. I'm equally in favor that free trade should be balanced with programs for workers who lose their jobs'' in the United States, said John Dean, the former chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank who is now managing partner of Startup Capital Ventures, which invests in companies in the United States and China. ``That's what has been missing over the last couple of years.''</p><p>Another trade tug-of-war that will be closely watched by tech companies is expected in coming months as Congress debates whether to renew President Bush's Trade Promotion Authority, otherwise known as ``fast track,'' which allows the administration to negotiate trade deals and then force Congress to accept or reject an agreement without changing it.</p><p>That authority expires June 30 if Congress takes no action. Susan Schwab, U.S. trade representative, will push hard for renewal, but many observers are pessimistic.</p><p>Companies such as Hewlett-Packard are aggressively pushing for presidential fast-track authority.</p><p>``In terms of bilateral free-trade agreements or regional free-trade agreements, the ongoing assumption is, no other trade partner would negotiate with us unless the president has that kind of negotiating authority,'' said David Isaacs, HP's director of government and public policy.</p><p>Contact John Boudreau at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jboudreau@mercurynews.com\">jboudreau@mercurynews.com</email> or (408) 278-3496.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-global0203022007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4N5K-HYT0-TWX2-W30J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1262\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11086\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>March 2, 2007 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GATT &amp;

They also are expected to demand tougher trade terms with South Korea. And they have signaled a desire to rein in President Bush's ability to independently negotiate new agreements.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are responding to voters' alarm over losing jobs as manufacturers relocate operations to countries that have lower costs and substandard labor and environmental regulations. And many Americans are unnerved by the burgeoning trade deficit, which reached a record-shattering $764 billion in 2006.</p><p>Voters often blame globalization for the loss of wage security, health coverage and pension benefits, and are pressuring politicians to put a brake on trade agreements they deem counter to U.S. interests.</p><p>Silicon Valley executives, while welcoming action against foreign tariffs, intellectual property violations and China's undervalued currency, worry that increased pressure from the United States could lead to retaliation and even trade wars that could stifle the growth of the valley's tech giants.</p><p>Rafiq Dossani, a senior research scholar at Stanford University who studies the valley's role in the global economy, says trade tensions pose a major threat.</p><p>``I'm sure it would be quite a disaster for Silicon Valley,'' he said. ``Silicon Valley is very competitive. It is selling products not manufactured elsewhere. It can charge whatever price the market will bear.''</p><p>Silicon Valley's ties to the global economy were ominously underscored earlier this week when a plunge in China's stocks sent a shudder through global markets that hammered the shares of the valley's big tech companies.</p><h>Export-oriented</h><p>Silicon Valley is ``one of the most, if not the most, export-oriented economies'' in the nation, observed Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. ``We are tied to foreign trade. That is one of the reasons we were able to do well last year, and will do well this year and next year, despite a slowing in the U.S.''</p><p>The region views globalization much differently than many traditional manufacturers and farming sectors, which often see their industries undercut by lower-priced overseas competitors. While tech companies can be hurt by the policies of other countries, such as their failure to crack down on tech piracy, they gain from setting up overseas plants in lower-cost regions.</p><p>They also locate offices overseas to help gain entry into foreign markets. That means companies with operations in China, for instance, benefit from the communist government's policy of preventing its currency from rising, said Clyde Prestowitz, author of ``Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East,'' and a member of Intel's policy advisory committee.</p><p>Congressional Democrats are considering punitive legislation directed at China because of its alleged currency manipulations and disregard for anti-piracy protections. That could help some U.S. companies but could hurt the valley's tech giants doing business in China.</p><p>``The spillover effect is hard to quantify, but it doesn't help,'' said Frederick Mayer, a Duke University professor and trade expert who worked on the North American Free Trade Agreement as a staffer for Sen. Bill Bradley in the 1990s.</p><p>U.S. trade relations with South Korea also could get bumpy. Current negotiations for a free-trade deal with that Asian tiger economy could be derailed by U.S. demands that Korea lower trade barriers that block the sale of U.S. autos and other goods.</p><p>``We favor a trade deal with Korea because it could mean better access for IT products there, but it could be held up by auto and pharmaceutical issues,'' said Rob Mulligan, senior vice president of AeA, which represents electronics companies.</p><p>The Korea negotiations illustrate how trade has become a hot political issue. Yet, it remains unclear how hard Democrats will push for trade reform. In November, 90 House Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, voted for a trade deal with Vietnam, and 94 opposed it.

They want no connection to this market what so ever. Thank goodness it is now Friday. It was one of those weeks on Wall Street. The 23rd of March. Now tonight, two days of trading 1,000 points lost, the Dow sinks again, China fights back on terrorists. Donald Trump keeps the U.S. government open after a will he or will he cliffhanger, and companies are unfriending Facebook by pulling their ads. I'm Paula Newton and this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>Tonight the Dow Jones sinks into correction territory. I know we haven't heard that for awhile as the trade war fears rattle the markets. Now stocks seesawed throughout the session. You had to pay attention today. The sell off picked up steam in just that last hour of trading. Now the Dow closed off 425 points. Get this, it's the worst week for the three major U.S. indices in more than two years. Yes, if you feel like it's rough, it is. The U.S. news followed a selling - a very heavy selling I should add - in Asia and Europe. The Nekkei was the worst affected, down some 4 percent. Stocks in Europe closed lower as well even though the E.U. is exempt from those U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. Can you say trade war? Claire Sebastian has been tracking all these numbers for us.</p><p>I mean Claire, look, it was in the last little bit that the bottom fell out. Was it on low volume. I mean what was going on?</p><p>CLAIRE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT: Well it was interesting to watch how it kind of developed throughout the day. We started the morning out talking to traders and many of them were feeling quite circumspect. They said you know look. China's response overnight with $3 billion in tariffs in response to originally to the (inaudible) tax. That was quite measured. We also saw exemptions for the E.U. and various other trading partners to the steel and aluminum tariffs and they were thinking perhaps if there was going to be a trade war it's not yet. Now we can move back in. Then we get to about lunch time and we have these comments from the.</p><p>NEWTON: This is torture just listening to you.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: It's extraordinary how these things evolve - the volatility at the moment. The Chinese ambassador said to Bloomberg News that we're not ruling out the potential to cut back on purchases of U.S. treasuries. That sent the market into a bit of turmoil. Then we have the spending bill confusion. Will he veto it, will he sign it? Then suddenly the bottom falls out and I think this is something we're seeing (inaudible). In the last year I was in trading suddenly people just don't see a reason to buy. You could say the machines are kicking in but I think in this case the volumes were very low. We're going into the weekend and the buyers just disappeared.</p><p>NEWTON: There was no one buying anything this afternoon. That was clear. What's interesting here is that for months we've been saying that the markets have been shrugging off a geopolitical risk, shrugging off the Trump White House and all its erratic moves, has anything changed?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes. I think it has.</p><p>NEWTON: I was afraid you would say that Claire.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well I was talking to a treasurer about this actually yesterday and he said it was infuriating because we are trading on the entries and exits into the White House and the fundamentals are still strong, the economy is still strong, earnings is still strong. Those are thing that are supposed to underpin the market but I think we're seeing some personnel changes that have a material impact on the market.</p><p>When we see the exit of Gary Cohn which just showed how committed Trump is to this protectionist agenda. The exit of Rex Tillerson who we saw as a moderate free trader, and just last night an hour or so after the market closed, we have H. R. McMaster being replaced by John Bolton who is seen as a foreign policy hawk. That is something that is unnerving to the markets. But we are in a very sensitive situation Paula and pick a headline and they'll trade on it frankly. That's where we are right now.</p><p>NEWTON: And we have to point out that some people actually like this volatility. We've been saying that for several weeks now. When we look at who the winners and loser were, I mean, it was for one of the first times that tech was not escaping this by any stretch of the imagination. Drop Box, we can verbal talk about them later, but tech also took it on the chin this week.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely tech was another thing was the worst off today out of all the three major indices and I think it's partly, we've seen a 1, 2, 3 punch about you could say this week - Facebook, the fed, and now the trade issue. And the trade issue, in fact it was the first thing and we're still seeing the drumbeat around the delete Facebook movement. It's still going. Today we saw [Elan Ross] today come out and delete the Facebook page to test their space access that those advertisers are there pulling ads off the platform.</p><p>The regulator issue, Mark Zuckerberg has until Monday to respond to the (culture media and sport committee) in the U.K. about whether he'll testify there. All of that could spread through the rest of tech if we start to see more regulation and I think people are still very nervous. I said to a trader this week that's faced with a buying opportunity. He said it was still a couple hundred and sixty dollars. It think it was a buying opportunity at 60. Now it's still expensive.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet there are some people jumping in. Claire if we have the stomach for it, let's have a look to next week. We will still have a lot of risk in the market as you said the fundamentals of the world wide economy are good and yet we might hear more from the Trump White House about Tariffs.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Absolutely we have those deadlines</p><p>[17:05:00]</p><p>Stacking up so the U.S. trade representative says that we should hear the list which is something the traders are very focused on the list of products that could face these tariffs. That could come out in the next few days. They have a 15 day deadline but they said it could be within days. And so for that China's, we're not going to call them reciprocal tariffs but their $3 billion worth of tariffs, that comment period ends on March 31. All of this is coming down next week and I think we could continue to see volatility and perhaps more unpredictable events that we have no way of knowing about right now.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes which the message is we should all enjoy our weekends right now. Especially you Claire. Thanks a lot for wrapping all that up. Who knew there would be so much excitement in the last two hours.</p><p>China meantime, as you've been saying, has been promising to fight a trade war to the end. It's responding to a one-two punch from the United States. Now the tariffs on steel and aluminum announced earlier this month and tariffs on about $50 billion worth of goods announced on Thursday. Now China has responded with tough rhetoric of course but we have to say the action has actually been restrained.</p><p>The government plans to slap tariffs on about $3 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from steel pipes to pork. Now China has also threatened to slow its purchases of U.S. government bonds. That is what Claire was talking about which was a huge risk to the market. China is America's biggest creditor. Who could forget? It holds about a trillion dollars of U.S. debt. Now President Trump insists relations with China are of course good. Actually he says they are great and markets won't be affected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well I think the stock market is going to be great and if the stock market is way up when I came into office, the stock market was from a different planet. It's way up. China is going to end up treating us fairly. For many years they've had free reign. They don't have free reign anymore. We're very friendly with China. We have great relationships with China and look it's time. It's time. Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China. We can't let that happen. Thank you all very much.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>NEWTON: Joining me now, Ann Lee is an adjunct professor at New York University and the author of \"What the U.S. Can Learn From China.\" What the U.S. is learning from China now is exactly how it will react.</p><p>You know many people have interpreted the reaction as being restrained. Is it truly restrained meaning how long can it last and what would change that equation for China?</p><p>ANN LEE, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AND AUTHOR: Well it looks like China really is exercising Judo strategy which is let the opponent throw all their weight and force and let it backfire on them. So I think China is trying to restrain itself and look like a good guy in the international field which is what they did when Trump pulled out of the Paris Accords and said we're not going to restrain ourselves with carbon emissions. And China stepped up to the plate and said we'll still take the lead there and it looks like here China wants to also do the same thing by saying look we're trying to be international law abiding country and want to follow the international rules while the U.S. violates and hopefully people will follow.</p><p>NEWTON: But will they take that only for so long meaning obviously China has a lot to lose if there is any kind of a trade war, a stakeout. At what point can we really see this get a lot uglier than it is now?</p><p>LEE: Well I guess that really depends on what the U.S. does too right? Because the U.S. says they're obviously going to do more than what's already been announced.</p><p>NEWTON: And as they said this is a negotiation. They've been very plain about that.</p><p>LEE: I hardly think that they're really sincere about it but they can say whatever they want and may not follow through. Look China really wants to avoid it because they know that history shows trade wars can lead to real wars. And a real war between U.S. and China is really the last thing anybody wants on earth right? So I think they're trying to do whatever they can to try to tamp down the rhetoric and the actions and slow it down so that hopefully cooler heads can prevail. But obviously China is not going to just sit there and let the U.S. walk all over it. They're going to draw the line somewhere. And we know China has drawn very strict lines around national security issues regarding boundaries like Taiwan. And so if the Trump Administration decides to go after those geopolitical areas, certainly China is not going to stand by.</p><p>NEWTON: And when we look at the entire picture of trade having to do again in Asia. When we look to South Korea, OK, they've been trying to renegotiate (inaudible). Wilbur Ross was at the White House today, commerce secretary, saying look we could have this signed in a week. I was in Seoul not too long ago, had a briefing from U.S. officials about this. What was so interesting is the pains that they went through to make sure that they could separate the security situation from real agitation on trade.</p><p>At what point did this become an imperative meaning we have to take trade off the table because security is just too important to us?</p><p>LEE: You mean the U.S.?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, the U.S. actually capitulating and saying let's get this done. Let's get this [chorus] signed, meaning the trade agreement with South Korea.</p><p>LEE: Well, we'll see. The U.S. certainly wants South Korea on its side for any geopolitical issues that flare up and they sorely need them as an ally. And so in that sense, South Korea may have the upper hand if that's truly the case. And what it does look like is they're gunning for a real conflict meaning a hot war of some sort. And so if that's the case then the Trump Administration is going to try to hand ring any of its allies to basically say you've got to be on our side and they're going to use whatever tactics they'll need to do.</p><p>NEWTON: It was nonetheless a really interesting development because South Korea has been a real irritant on trade for several years with the United States. Thanks so much for coming in. I really appreciate it. I know it has been an incredibly busy day.</p><p>We now know that China, as we were talking about, will retaliate; the question that we specifically have and the next potential weapon, the tiny little soybean. Matt Rivers has more. (BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>TRUMP: It is the largest deficit of any country in the history of our world. It is out of control.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: With that Donald Trump took his first major action specifically against China on trade. The President authorized some $60 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S. after a seven month investigation into alleged Chinese theft of American intellectual property. But we don't exactly know which of its products will be hit with a new tax, China has already vowed to not take the hit lying down. Case in point, Beijing just responded to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum products that Trump announced earlier this month by threatening to levy new taxes on American imports here worth $3 billion; everything from fruits and nuts and steels pipes. All this talk of tit for tat is making American industries nervous.</p><p>Start with the simple soybean. The U.S. is the world's top soybean exporter and China is its biggest buyer by far, billions and billions of dollars worth was unloaded at ports like this one last year. And American farmers are well positioned to take advantage of that growth. The U.S. Soybean Council expects U.S. exports of soybeans to keep rising for at least the next 20 years and it's not just farmers reaping the benefits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFED MALE: Your diner and your doctors and your - and other companies.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>RIVERS: But already officials and Chinese state media have singled out soybeans as a potential top target in Beijing's retaliation against these U.S. tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>KIRK LEEDS, CEO OF THE IOWA SOYBEAN ASSOCIATION: They know if you look at President Trump's election and where those votes came from, a lot of them came from the Midwest and states that are very large in soybean production.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>RIVERS: Kirk Leeds is visiting China with an agricultural delegation from one such U.S. state, Iowa.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>LEEDS: The rhetoric has begun to (inaudible) at winners and losers in trade relations and negotiations that American farmers will, unfortunately might be the ones who will pay the price for other industries.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>RIVERS: Restrictions on market access could devastate U.S. industry and it's not just soy. Other industries and companies could be government targets too; think Apple or Boeing or Cisco, pawns in a potential trade war with lots of influence back home.</p><p>A recent survey shows the majority of U.S. companies in China think trade between both countries isn't fair. They want things to change but nobody wants a trade war. To achieve both, any new U.S. policies will have to walk a fine line as thin as a flake of soybean. Matt Rivers, CNN, Qinhuangdao, China.</p><p>NEWTON: OK. (inaudible) at the White House. Now don't worry if you've lost track of everything Donald Trump has done in the last two day. We've got this when we come back.</p><p>[17:15:00]</p><p>NEWTON: A French police officer is fighting for his life after bravely halting a terror rampage in France. The sleepy rural town of Thebes erupted in chaos when a man on a shooting spree killed three people. Authorities believe it started when the gunman claimed to be from ISIS shot at four police officers from a car. The attacker stole a vehicle, killing its driver, before storming a nearby supermarket and killing two of its staff. A tense hostage situation there was brought to an end when an officer who had offered himself as a hostage killed the attacker. Speaking earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron praised the actions of that brave police officer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: (Through interpreter) Our country has been struck today by Islamist Terrorist attack. The courage of one particular senior police officer who voluntarily took the place of other hostages and who is very seriously wounded, he saved lives and he does honor to his force and his country.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>NEWTON: Melissa Bell is near the scene in Southern France and Melissa thanks for joining us. You know that tiny town so terrorized today and yet what we saw today was quite dramatic and quite different. We saw that, we were just talking about that hostage swap and then the tactical teams moving in so quickly.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right and the actions of that particular police officer who has been praised tonight, (inaudible), French President Emmanuel Macron, but also the prosecutor Francois Molins from whom we learned earlier more of the details of what is known at these early stages of the investigation. I don't know, Beltrame, we're told by sources close to the investigation is tonight fighting for his life.</p><p>I'm standing just outside the apartment building that is the subject of the investigation this evening Paula, the raids continue here tonight. Within the last 20 minutes we've seen police officers heavily armed and protected making their way out of the building with sniffer dogs and there is quite a heavy police presence. We've got police trucks with riot police in them to our left and to our right and they've warned us not to try and get any closer.</p><p>They say the [users] have lived here and have prepared projectiles and said they will not let journalists get any closer. And even with this police presence immediately around us, a couple of locals did come up to us and threatened us a little earlier on. So quite a tense situation here even tonight even as these raids continue, as police try and work out precisely the recent history of (inaudible) who is with, we believe, lived in this apartment block when he began. That series of attacks as you say they began here in Carcassonne early on. He began with a carjacking, went on to take on those police officers.</p><p>One of the things we learned tonight Paula from the chief prosecutor is that he spent some time in front of military barracks perhaps considering taking them on. He moved instead to police headquarters taking on four of them returning from a morning jog and hurting one of them - shooting at one of them getting him in the shoulder before moving on to that supermarket not terribly far outside of Carcassonne, just a few miles in the town of Trebe.</p><p>But an extremely shocking theories of attacks, three people dead, 16 injured and tonight France's Interior Minister is here in Carcassonne. He's been meeting, paying visits in the hospital to some of those who are still ill.</p><p>NEWTON: Still to learn there, Melissa as you point out, is was he acting alone, is this another cell? Again, a French officials there have been trying to get a handle. CNN's Melissa Bell remains there on the scene. Thank you very much. Now even by the standards of the Trump White House, the past 30 years - past 30 hours</p><p>[17:20:00]</p><p>I should say. It does feel like 30 years doesn't it? My gosh, segment's a doozie. Close to 1:00 p.m. yesterday, Trump directs the U.S. to level tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports then five hours later he tweets that National Security Advisor, H. R. McMaster is out replaced by the oh so controversial John Bolton. Then this morning, I remember it well just before 9:00 a.m. Trump tweets again threatening to, yes, veto the crucial spending bill Congress has just passed over night. Five hours later he signs the bill he's just threatened to veto calling it a ridiculous situation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>TRUMP: But I say to Congress I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old. Some people don't know what it -- $1.3 trillion.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>NEWTON: Jeff Zeleny is covering all this chaos again from the White House. We will point out it is a Friday evening and Jeff you know what that means? It's the witching hour at the White House. I do the President has now, though, apparently left, right? And he is on his way to a long weekend in Florida. But Jeff, I mean we just went through the timeline. Can you take us through kind of the back story to everything that happened today?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Sure, certainly another tumultuous week here at the White House. Just moments ago the President did fly out, leaving the White House here. He's flying down to Florida for a weekend at Mar-A-Lago. But boy the revolving door continues here at the White House. Most particularly the firing of National Security Advisor General H. R. McMaster and the hiring the incoming National Security Advisor John Bolton certainly is signaling a change in - or a potential change at the very least in foreign policy here at the White House. John Bolton is someone the President has been watching on Fox News for a long time. He has very hawkish views, very different views on a variety, in fact on many matters. So that certainly will be a change. That is taking effect in a couple weeks or so, but boy, certainly the stock market did not like the events here at the White House this week; the Dow falling, of course. So as we end this week, we believe that business is mainly completed. We don't expect any more firings. That is always a possibility but certainly this President is overseeing a lot of staff shakeup here and more to come. He still says he wants to change some members of his cabinet here. So it's part of the drama he insists on. We'll see what happens next week Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: You know in terms of American foreign policy, we are talking about the fact that we will have a new National Security Advisor, but not to be forgotten, it seems like years ago but we had Rex Tillerson leave and Mike Pompeo will come in. From you indications from the White House there, how much does Donald Trump actually want to remake the foreign policy initiatives that he started a little bit more than a year ago?</p><p>ZELENY: I mean it does seem like that is how he's shaping his sets of advisors. You know the Iran Nuclear Deal is coming up for recertification in May. John Bolton, of course, is a very hard liner on Iran so certainly if he follows his views, something will change there. But of course, it's the President's views who advisors work around and what the key here is with this new National Security Advisor, how does that change that potential meeting with Kim Jong-un. We have been talking about that potential meeting between the President and Kim Jong-un at the end of May, by the end of May.</p><p>H. R. McMaster, the former National Security Advisor, was potentially leading the charge here on those discussions so unclear how this will all affect it. But with the new Secretary of State in play as well as the new National Security Advisor, we certainly expect some type of change likely a more confrontational approach to foreign policy.</p><p>NEWTON: And certainly one that the President is saying he will be much more comfortable with. Our Jeff Zeleny there who I hope has some time off this weekend. We'll see you Jeff. Take care, appreciate the update.</p><p>Now some of the most highly respected voices in U.S. foreign policy, for some of the reasons Jeff was just explaining are sounding the alarm warning that Washington is creating a very dangerous world.</p><p>Richard Haass tweeted, this is the most perilous moment in modern American history and one we brought on ourselves. Haass is the President of the Council on Foreign Relations and a Senior State Department official. He warned of the risk of economic, political, and actual war.</p><p>Ian Bremmer in the mean time called the new terrorist against China and the appointment of John Bolton quote, the worst day for geopolitical risk since I started Eurasia Group in 1998. Now the rate of turnover among key decision makers in the Trump Administration stands at - drum roll please - under 50 percent at a mere 48 percent according to the Brookings Institution. In his first</p><p>[17:25:00]</p><p>year, the rate of departures in this White House have far outpaced the last five administrations. Rana Roroohar, CNN's Global Economic Analyst, you're nodding your head, to a lot has been said there (ph), but Rana, tell me, some people will just say its hyperbole. It doesn't matter who's in there. No one's going to start a war.</p><p>RANA ROROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: You know I know both Richard and Ian very well. They're not people that are given to these kinds of statements unless it's really serious, unless they mean it. And, you know, I have to agree. I feel like all of us that have covered this White House and covered these news events are constantly in the [seventh] stage of the brief. You never quite where you are.</p><p>I have to say I feel we have entered a new moment. I think the situation with China is very worrisome right now. And it's interesting. The fact that you see tariffs being slapped on at the same time that you see John Bolton coming in, that is an interesting sign. I knoticed that when the President was signing tariffs, an executive from Lockheed Martin was right beside him. Lockheed Martin gets pretty much most of its budget from the Pentagon. Trade wars can sometimes become real wars and I see messaging there that's very disturbing to me.</p><p>NEWTON: It's so interesting that you say that Rana, and I know that you really talk to a lot of people about this. When you look at the divide between politics and what companies, like what we're saying. Come on, they have skin in the game as well.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>NEWTON: Is there any moderating factor there? Because they seem to be piling in and saying, actually geopolitical risk may be bad for the stock market but some of what's been going on in trade around the world.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>NEWTON: .we've got the President's ear and we're going to use it.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Well it's interesting. See I wonder if CEOs have the President's ear. Because if you remember, the manufacturing council, business council were disbanded in part because CEOs felt that the President was not listening to their concerns. You know every since the tariff announcement, I've been fielding comments, letters from industry groups, from CEOs, that are very worried about this. The idea that a trade war is easy to win is just such an irresponsible thing to say for starters. There is no winner in a trade war and there certainly no winner when you get geopolitical risk going on.</p><p>One more thing that's interesting is markets don't really know how to price geopolitical risk and I've actually been amazed that we haven't seen a stronger reaction at various points leading up to this moment.</p><p>NEWTON: And they haven't priced it and we've been talking about this and finally you actually start to see it today and then last week.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Yes, that's right and I think it's the culmination. I mean we knew more volatility was coming and we're going to see a lot more going forward. But this is the culmination of OK, we see on event, the next event, suddenly you can't really ignore that neoliberalism as we know it, globalization as we know it, seems to be coming apart economically, politically, we're in a new era.</p><p>NEWTON: And it's interesting to see that at this point in time China is actually the one stepping in and saying everyone get a hold of themselves. But you mentioned it before that the situation in China is really worrying you because they have had a restrained reaction and Donald Trump acts as if he's using it as a bargaining chip. Like look we're going to end up in a much better place with China.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Yes, it's interesting, Maggie Haberman from the \"New York Times\" tweeted something earlier saying I wish everybody would stop thinking there's a grand plan here. There's no grand plan.</p><p>NEWTON: Gosh no. Now you tell us Maggie.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Exactly. Exactly. I have to agree with that. I mean one of the things I was watching for very early in the Presidency was this idea of economic nationalism. What does it really mean because you can make a case. Some people on the left would make a case. But you need to put America first in certain ways but this presidency has had no coherent strategy. It's almost as if every action cancels out the action before. So you talk about wanting to bolster American manufacturing and then you start a trade spat with China. Every policy action doesn't seem to be linked. It's as though the President gets up in the morning and decides what to do and that's not a way to run an economy.</p><p>NEWTON: And when we factor everything that you said into the market risk, some people have pointed out that look if we start this trade war with China, products will become more expensive, inflation will go up and when inflation goes up the fed doesn't have many options.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Exactly. And the fed is already - as we know the fed is in a difficult moment. Let's say things were perfect in the geopolitical environment. The fed would still be facing a very difficult moment. In the last decade we dumped $4 trillion in this country into the global economy; all over central bankers around the world $30 trillion. I mean that masks a lot of problems so when that money starts to pull out you begin to see more volatility and risk and that's without all these other decisions in the room. And it's very, very concerning.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, I was just saying I didn't know if I had the stomach to face next week at the time. Rana, thank.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Think Friday. Friday.</p><p>NEWTON: I know. We'll celebrate through the weekend although then again there is that Stormy Daniels interview on CBS.</p><p>ROROOHAR: Oh dear.</p><p>[17:30:00] NEWTON: OK, Rana, on that note, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Now Twitter users dared Elon Musk to delete his company's Facebook pages, a few minutes later, yes, they were gone. The backlash against Facebook and its data scandal is underway.</p><p>NEWTON: Hello, I'm Paula Newton. Coming up in the next half hour on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, Elon Musk pulls his company's pages off of Facebook, agreed to another company putting their online ads on ice, and a miserable day, understatement for tech stocks, being spoiled with Dropbox, I do owe, no, we did not spoil it.</p><p>You'll hear from their chief operating officer, first though, these are the top headlines on Cnn this hour. Three people were killed in Southern France Friday and what the French President is calling an Islamic terrorist attack.</p><p>A gunman stole a car, fired at a police officers and took hostages in the supermarket. He was killed after a four-hour standoff. Witnesses say he claimed to be an ISIS soldier.</p><p>At least 13 people were reported killed and 35 wounded Friday night in a car bombing in southern Afghanistan. The blast took place outside a sports stadium in the capital of Helmand Province.</p><p>A wrestling match was underway at the time of the attack, an official says the victims were civilians. The U.S. has indicted nine Iranian individuals and an Iranian company for what it says was a massive and bracing hacking scheme.</p><p>Some of the main targets were professors at universities in the U.S. and 21 other countries. The indictment says the hacking was carried out to benefit Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard.</p><p>Silence from Donald Trump after Cnn's exclusive interview with the former \"Playboy\" playmate. Karen McDougal says she had a ten-month affair with Mr. Trump, beginning in 2006 while he was married to Melania.</p><p>She says Mr. Trump tried to pay her after their first sexual encounter, but she refused. Investigators from Britain's data watchdog agency have now entered the London offices of Cambridge Analytica shortly after a search warrant.</p><p>Now, the firm is at the center of a controversy over allegations that it reportedly, improperly obtained Facebook data to target U.S. voters in the 2016 elections.</p><p>Dropbox; the file-sharing service has just dropped its own strong market debut. So let's take a look at the numbers, the IPO price was set at just $21 a share, raising nearly $760 million, even not though well above the original price range.</p><p>[17:35:00] Tonight, the stock closed up nearly 36 percent at $28 a share. Dennis Woodside is Chief Operating Officer at Dropbox with just 11 million paying subscribers out of 500 million registered users. I asked him how he could grow this business.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS WOODSIDE, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, DROPBOX: We have 11 million paying subscribers for Dropbox, which in the world of business software is a lot of people.</p><p>There are very few companies that have that kind of skill. And we're really focused on solving a universal problem which is how do I collaborate in a seamless way, whether I'm on mobile, what -- regardless of what device I'm on around content at work and around my most important files.</p><p>It could be video, it could be PowerPoint. That's a massive opportunity for us over the next couple of years, and in addition, we're really figuring out what are the next problems that our users are asking us to solve and building problems to solve those -- or building products to solve those problems.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and that certainly speaks to innovation. The problem is when you're thinking about the cloud now, it's a crowded space and it's an expensive space.</p><p>We've seen companies like Oracle already getting trouble up there. What is your competitive edge?</p><p>WOODSIDE: You know, so Dropbox has had competitors -- big competitors for a long time. When we started the company, and Drew and Arash started the company, very soon they were after some of the big guys got into the space, and since then we've added, you know, over a billion dollars in revenue.</p><p>So you know, we're focused on one problem, we solve this problem better than anybody else, it's a deeply technical challenge that we've been able to meet.</p><p>And you know, when we look forward we think we're going to continue to innovate, invent the next product, one of those products is called Paper which is a collaborative tool that enables people to create amazing things regardless of what device they're on or where they are in the world.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, so, you know, you say you definitely had a competitive edge, and yet some of your competitors, Microsoft, Amazon, Google can pretty much swallow you whole if they want to.</p><p>I'm not sure that they're in the business of wanting to do that right now, that is though a risk. What I want to talk to you about though, is the fact that the cloud is getting very expensive.</p><p>One of the main reasons is the fact of security. You are smaller than your competitors. So what can you tell us especially when we've had several days now of reports that data breaches and data security is a key issue?</p><p>WOODSIDE: Well, we have some of the best engineers in the world focused on security. You know, we've been able to hire some of the best in brains in Silicon Valley to focus on this issue.</p><p>And our product, our business really is built on trust, one of our core values is be worthy of trust --</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, we've heard that earlier in the week, we heard that earlier - -</p><p>WOODSIDE: Yes --</p><p>NEWTON: In the week from Facebook. I just want to point out what concretely because I can tell you whether you're in business or whether you're just a person at home using Dropbox, you're getting a little edgy.</p><p>WOODSIDE: I think it's very different, you know, some of the media models are built on using information about individuals, our business is not built on that.</p><p>We are paid voluntarily by users who find value from our product, and we don't use that information, we don't sell it to anybody, we don't use that information in rather advertising in revenue --</p><p>NEWTON: But that doesn't mean you're not vulnerable to -- it doesn't mean you're not vulnerable to hack.</p><p>WOODSIDE: Well, look I think -- I think the benefit of what we've been able to do is build an incredibly secure system where -- that we encrypt all of your information, whether it's at rest or whether it's in transit.</p><p>So in other words, on the web, on the internet, and you know, we have to obviously remain vigilant about security at all times.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: We're going to take his word on that. Now growing with stiff companies or taking a break from advertising on Facebook, I'll speak to Sonos; the smart speaker company is going dark on big tech for one week.</p><p>[17:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWTON: Investigators from Britain's data watchdog agency have entered the offices of Cambridge Analytica earlier Friday, a high court judge issued a search warrant for the company.</p><p>Cnn senior investigative correspondent Drew Griffin joins us now from London. Drew, good to have you there right now. You know, there's a lot of confusion because sometime earlier in the week, Facebook said they were going to try and do this audit and then the government basically said hold up, we want to have a look inside first.</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Facebook actually had investigators at the headquarters of Cambridge Analytica, which is the company in question.</p><p>But those investigators hired by Facebook were told to stand down until the information commissioner's office could enact their search warrant.</p><p>They're executing that search warrant as we speak, Paula, and trying to determine at the heart of this is this Facebook data and the misuse or alleged misuse of it.</p><p>Whether that may have been illegally acquired and used for Cambridge Analytica in its many different pursuits and political operations.</p><p>So that investigation continues both here in the U.K. and several investigations continue in the United States involving this one firm.</p><p>NEWTON: You know, Drew, there's still a lot of people saying that, look, what Facebook did was a breach of trust, but was it illegal?</p><p>The laws are going to be different on one side of the pond as there are on the other. It seems that here, the U.K. really wants to see as if their laws were broken, and yet this is several years now, none of this was done when Facebook first learned of this breach.</p><p>GRIFFIN: It's absolutely right because nobody knew if you believe Facebook story that the information was being used in this way that violated company rules.</p><p>Facebook opened up its data files to a researcher and according to Facebook or Facebook story, is that researcher did not use it for research but set up his own company and began selling the personal information, the personal data on upwards of 50 million Facebook users to companies particularly Cambridge Analytica was then developed as psychological mapping, which was able to target voters in the United States.</p><p>But not only in the United States, perhaps here in the U.K., in Africa, in South and Central America, pretty much all over the world. And what's been described to me, Paula, is kind of a targeted psychological operations being used in the political field.</p><p>NEWTON: And again, a bit startling to think that yes, that might have happened, yes, in some countries including the United States, it might not even have been illegal.</p><p>Now, I know, Drew, this is difficult to parse, but I know if somebody -- anybody can do it, you can. There also alarmingly could be some connections to all of these -- all of these Russia investigations that they're going through -- going through.</p><p>I mean, there are Russians involved here and Russian institutions.</p><p>NEWTON: What's interesting, Paula, is that these two groups, Cambridge Analytica and its political works and what the Russians were doing according to U.S. special prosecutor Robert Muller seem to be the same tactic.</p><p>Fake news to be infiltrated among social networks to try to divide and sow unrest among a populace. There is no direct connection yet between the two companies -- countries, entities, but certainly many people are looking for that.</p><p>These kind of psychological operations are very much prevalent in warfare. These are weapons of war and what Cambridge Analytica is accused of doing now is taking this mind operation, the psychological weapon of war and applying it to regular, democratic elections which startles many people and it's very interesting, that it is also in line with the kinds of activities that we now believe took place in Russia.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, this is still going to take a lot more investigations, our Drew Griffin there following this investigations from London now, appreciate your update, Drew.</p><p>[17:45:00] Now, soaking a battle of the tech billionaire, as Elon Musk has deleted the Tesla and Space X Facebook pages, its part of a growing corporate backlash against Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg after the data scandal that's consuming the social network.</p><p>Never short on snuck, Musk sent a tweet asking what's Facebook? When folks tweeted back and asked him to take his pages down, they were gone within minutes.</p><p>Other companies are also hitting Facebook where it hurts. Mozilla, the maker of Firefox says it's going to stop advertising on Facebook until it quote, \"takes stronger action and how it shares customer data.\"</p><p>And Sonos, the smart speaker company is pulling ads from all of big tech, that's Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter. The company says it will go dark for one week, starting Monday.</p><p>And Joy Howard is the Chief Marketing Officer at Sonos and she joins me here now in studio, thank you so much. Can you explain the thinking behind these actions and more importantly, what you hope to gain from this?</p><p>JOY HOWARD, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER, SONOS: Yes, well, we believe that this Cambridge Analytica scandal raises important questions about whether big tech is doing enough to balance its own interests with its biggest responsibility which is safeguarding your privacy.</p><p>It's also an important moment for brands like us to reflect on the role that we play in all of this. And for us, it's an important moment to elevate the voices of activists, academics and consumer rights groups, civil society groups who are working to defend consumer rights.</p><p>NEWTON: Now you're taking the money that you place on those ads and giving it to charity as well for a week. I think some people might say, look, Joy, it's a good marketing stunt, but at the end of the day it's a stunt because they might even look to you as a speaker company and say, hey, how do we know what that speaker is even doing in our household at this point in time?</p><p>Is it a reflection in general for all of tech?</p><p>JOY: It's a reflection for all of tech for sure, and safeguarding your privacy is a critical importance to anyone who depends on the internet for their business.</p><p>Facebook, Google, they're important partners to us and they're only as valuable to us and to you and to everyone as our trust in them is.</p><p>So, we feel like you know, this is something that matters a lot to us, we've been working with our NGO partner Access(ph) for some time now, and elevating their voices and elevating the voices of activists felt like the right thing to do right now.</p><p>NEWTON: And is this a point of inclusion in the company to say that we are going to take a critical view at our options as well.</p><p>HOWARD: Absolutely, it's a moment to press pause for everyone to stop and reflect on what it means to work together and how we can partner to create a better social platform for each other.</p><p>NEWTON: What will determine whether or not it will last longer than a week?</p><p>HOWARD: I'd have to -- you know, we heard from Facebook right away today - -</p><p>NEWTON: Oh, you did?</p><p>HOWARD: Of course we did --</p><p>NEWTON: And what did they say?</p><p>HOWARD: They said they take it very seriously just like we do. And so I think you know, ultimately, the question is do companies like ours have a choice other than Facebook and Google?</p><p>So more than 70 percent of the ad dollars and some of the markets are working as far higher than that or spent on these platforms.</p><p>It's basically a duopoly, and so for companies like us who really now have no choice right now to read to our customers entering these platforms.</p><p>NEWTON: When they spoke to you, did they say, please don't do this or don't extend it or just -- what did they say?</p><p>HOWARD: I mean, they value our partnership and we value our partnership with them. And again the only reason we're working with partners is to make each other better.</p><p>So I think what they're saying is, we -- it's critically important to us, to Google and Facebook and also the Sonos, that people trust the interactions that they're having on our platforms are safe and secured.</p><p>NEWTON: Do you think this is something more than a few weeks -- I heard some people complaining that, look, this is only going to last a few weeks and then we're all going to forget about it.</p><p>Or is it a real reflection point for your kind of industry but also of course places like Google, Facebook and Twitter?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, we're absolutely in this for the long haul, we've been committed, you know, always to privacy for our consumers and we've worked increasingly over the last years, so with NGOs who care about defending your digital rights because we think it's important that they'd be protected.</p><p>NEWTON: What things have you guys done to audit your own behavior though? Because there are some concerns where you even speak (INAUDIBLE) household.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes, well, we take every step that we can, and safeguarding your privacy is of critical importance to us. We've also recently entered the smart speaker space as you referenced before.</p><p>And so one of the features of our product that really matters to us is that we've hard-wired the microphones on our speakers. So if you want to turn the microphone off, you can clearly press the button that can't be hard - just -- it's hardwired to the microphone and you can simply turn it off.</p><p>That's an example of the step that we're taking to make sure that you feel like you can trust us and that you know that when you want to turn the microphones off in your house, you can do it.</p><p>NEWTON: But to be clear, you are examining other steps as well.</p><p>HOWARD: Absolutely, we're going to continue to look at everything that we can do to safeguard your privacy.</p><p>NEWTON: And from your point of view, what have we learned in the last week about --</p><p>HOWARD: I mean, I think the most important thing that we've learned is that people will interact on these platforms with each other and with our brand only if they trust them.</p><p>And so once big tech loses our trust, its value to us as human beings and to us as business partners is very limited. And that -- if we've learned anything, it stopped.</p><p>[17:50:00] NEWTON: OK, but we'll see how things change going forward, thanks so much for being here --</p><p>HOWARD: Yes, thank you for having me, thanks a lot --</p><p>NEWTON: Really appreciate it. Now buying a pint of your favorite wine sounds rather vulgar these days, but after Britain leaves the EU, you'll be able to do just that.</p><p>We'll pass the buck(ph) on that story in just a minute.</p><p>NEWTON: Champaign for everybody.

It's well established in still wine and now it's moving into sparkling.</p><p>Unlike its rival French Champaign, a couple would like to serve it from a very British spice bottle, the pint.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Sparkling wine has always been my favorite drink, and to be actually honest, let's say you've got two and a half glasses in it, that's got six glasses in it.</p><p>And of an evening if I want to drink -- I feel a bit extravagant, if it's just the two of us at home to open a full bottle, but the pint bottle is perfect with four glasses.</p><p>STEWART: Pints of Champaign were extremely popular pre 1973 when Britain joined the European block, then EU regulations came bubbling up, dictating that sparkling wine could only be sold in 375 or 750 milliliters.</p><p>And any multiple of that, but not the pint, 500 and 68 milliliters. Winston Churchill was often spotted with a class of Champaign and is widely reported to have being a big proponent of the pint size bottle, saying an imperial pint is an ideal size for a man like me.</p><p>Even after two at lunch and one at dinner. Some may think it's the perfect size, but until the U.K. actually leaves the EU, the pint size bottles are lying in wait.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We bottled about 800 of the pint size bottle in 2015. We haven't bottled anymore because we can't legally sell it.</p><p>However, we're planning to do some next year and that will be ready for release in 2021 when hopefully the laws will change in the U.K. and then we can sell seven years.</p><p>[17:55:00] STEWART: So whether it's to celebrate or commensurate the end of the U.K.'s EU membership, Brits may be able to pop open a pint of sparkling wine. Anna Stewart, Cnn East Sussex, U.K.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: And let me say, I'm really glad we did not open a controversy over the British pint and beer, but interesting nonetheless, now, we give you European markets that closed sharply lower on the last day of trading, sweet amid fears of a trade war sparked by terrorists on steel and aluminium.</p><p>Now Germany's Dax fared the worst, it was off as much as 2 percent at one stage, both Germany and its EU partners planning to respond with their own tariffs until they too were added to that exemptions list.</p><p>Now at the EU's summit in Brussels, British Prime Minister Theresa May says EU leaders are working to make that exemption permanent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM: We've been working very hard to secure an EU-wide exemptions to the steel tariffs that the Americans have announced.</p><p>I am pleased that they've announced a temporary exemption for the EU. What I'll be working with my fellow EU leaders today on is to see how we can secure a permanent exemption for the EU for those steel tariffs, and we'll be talking about what the next steps might be.</p><p>And I have stayed on to talk about those next steps because the steel industry is hugely important to the U.K. and to the British government, and I want to ensure that steel workers and their jobs are properly safeguarded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: In the meantime, fears of a trade war pushed stocks sharply lower on Wall Street, the Dow closed off 425 points -- it was ugly, it is now officially in correction territory, the Nasdaq fell below the 7,000 mark, it cups the worst week for U.S. stocks in more than 2 years.</p><p>The Dow lost more than 1,000 points in just two sections. Facebook, just a reminder as well, was down 14 percent, and I wish it were a little bit more optimistic for me, but that is it, everyone have a good weekend, Richard will be back here on Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032301cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY8-3251-DXH2-60YP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8508\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dow Jones Index</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nekkei</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mark Zuckerberg</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>H.

Broadly speaking, that covers four areas. The core area is electronic/algorithmic trading and optimization of the portfolio. The second is oversight of quantitative research in securities finance, which is a joint venture with our State Street Associates group and part of our global exchange division. It leverages cutting-edge technology and securities finance data to deliver a new type of research offering. The third is financial planning and analysis, which utilizes multiple data sources and other tools to create analytics for forecasting and reporting purposes.</p><p> The last one ties everything together: the digital transformation of the business. For example, which aspects of the business can you automate and in what priority? How do you employ technology, both new and legacy, to make the business more efficient, and design products on the back of that? That process is exciting because you need collaboration-different opinions and partnerships-to bring about the transformation.</p><p> GARRITT: What is your role as a manager and/or trader?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Aside from the day-to-day, transactional part, it is about leadership-especially in electronic trading. How are new technologies changing the market landscape? How does technology change automation? How will it affect current products and drive the development of new ones? How do we use technology to make the business more efficient? Related topics include thinking about the skill sets of our employees and hiring the right people.</p><p> The need for the financial industry to hire data scientists has been somewhat overstated recently, but it is true that the skills we need reflect that we are no longer competing only with other companies in finance. We are competing with big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon and thinking about how to use data more holistically to drive business decisions.</p><p> Along those lines, State Street is collaborating with different groups, both internally and externally. Our industry is changing so rapidly that it is almost impossible to have all the skill sets you need in one single area and at the exact time you need them. It's important to forge new relationships, think about things differently, and apply those learnings. An example is our aforementioned State Street Associates' joint venture. That product would not be possible without the skill sets on both sides and collaboration between the different business units.</p><p> GARRITT: What is covered under optimizing the trading book?</p><p> DELIKARIS: There are two main aspects under optimization: point-of-transaction and portfolio management. At the point of transaction, the goal is how to make an optimal decision given your current state.</p><p> Portfolio management is looking at your trading book in a more holistic capacity and making adjustments depending on a variety of parameters.</p><p> As it relates to securities finance, we look at balance sheet usage, liquidity, counterparty risk, regulatory limitations and revenue opportunities when we position our trading book. In other words, we look at the overall portfolio, consider multiple factors that often compete against one another, and adjust trading strategies to get an optimal portfolio state.</p><p> Functionally, it is designing algorithms around these concepts and thinking about the right metrics to optimize against. How do I make sure that performance is maximized against the entire breadth of the trading book where constraints at the business unit, bank, and external level all exist? These dynamics are very fluid and are often dictated by bigger forces, like regulation and market dynamics, so we need to be nimble to be effective.</p><p> GARRITT: Before we move on to the next question, how would you describe algorithmic trading?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Think about any task. You can distill it down to a series of steps that you follow to achieve a goal. After repetition, you are able to refine and make improvements, but hopefully you start to think, \"How do I make those steps more efficient, or outright automated?\" To me, that's algorithmic trading. You get a list of parameters, code them in a series, and implement them. The exact implementation is changing with new technologies, but that's all it is: codifying a series of steps a computer can understand to make sure a consistent result happens over and over.</p><p> GARRITT: How is algorithmic trading being used in securities lending trading? And how is trading changing with new technologies?</p><p> DELIKARIS: All trading businesses use electronic trading, algorithmic trading-whatever you want to call it-as a cornerstone of their operations. What you're seeing in securities finance now is that transaction times are being sped up, after lagging the market versus other products over the last decade or so. In the early 2000s, traditional cash equity trading was going through its own transformation. That's when high-frequency firms emerged, taking the opportunity of the more digital and electronic exchanges. Securities finance has always been a bespoke market, but that is starting to change drastically because of regulations that are a by-product of the financial crisis.</p><p> The focus on financial research management, or FRM, as well as new risk parameters have made it impossible to trade entirely manually because the complexity has increased exponentially. Before these constraints, you could borrow and lend, make a spread, and repeat an infinite amount of times. That is no longer even remotely possible. Securities lending had to change in order to absorb this complexity, not just with general collateral trades, which has long been automated in some aspects, but by allowing more complicated transactions to be done in this manner-for example, specials or hard-to-borrow trading.</p><p> FRM has made general collateral transactions much more complicated and important because of how they affect the balance sheet. Different collateralization types and models drastically affect the balance sheet and liquidity structure and, ultimately, the profitability of a transaction. You have different constraints across participants because of their corporate structure, the type of collateral they accept, and the securities they hold. This has become a big optimization problem that needs a sophisticated electronic solution.</p><p> The infrastructure between counterparties has also evolved drastically. New platforms allow us to implement sophisticated electronic strategies on transactions that are more complex. We are now in a position to overlay new technologies and decision-making strategies to evolve our trading operations.</p><p> More specifically, how are we using these technologies? Machine learning can help detect anomalies. You can try to figure out when and what types of trades will fail. We can be more predictive on where borrow and loan rates are going. Machine learning helps us find patterns in massive data sets to help us trade more efficiently.</p><p> In securities finance, you cover almost every security, both equities and fixed income. There is no way a trader can be cognizant of every single source of news and other factors driving trading technicals. By using natural language processing, we can create a huge curated news source scraping a myriad of news articles, extracting entities from those articles, and applying a sentiment score to figure out if the news is negative or positive.</p><p> Mapping that against our trading book allows traders to be immediately informed when something is happening to a company that directly impacts their position. Alternatively, maybe this is an opportunity to highlight a security to get more supply out or adjust rates because we know it will get harder to borrow. These things are making a difference in how traders transact.</p><p> GARRITT: You mentioned a few different technologies in your prior comment. What are the main technologies shaping the industry? There seem to be a lot of buzzwords. Can you help clarify the landscape?</p><p> DELIKARIS: One of the most important things, especially with all of the different terminologies being introduced, is to have a handle on the interplay between these different technologies. The goal is to understand these technologies are not independent of one another. They play among one another-either directly, because you need one to implement another, or in parallel, as the entire workflow is interconnected.</p><p> I often use a pyramid to describe this notion. In this construct, the base layer is data. The most common term here is unified data architecture, or UDA. Generally, this is about where the data resides and ensuring it is structured logically and is accessible in a timely manner. The goal is to have a repository you can access without having to do additional work to make it usable. Data comes in many forms: structured, unstructured, or alternative. I would categorize \"alternative\" as simply \"new\" types of data-satellite images, geolocational, etc.-but the objective is the same: clean and accessible.</p><p> Going up one layer on the pyramid is where you come across platforms and infrastructure that consume the data and make it easy to access, share, and use. Buzzwords associated with this layer are distributed ledger technology [DLT]/blockchain, and cloud, among others. These platforms harness the data below, allowing it to be accessed in a meaningful and governed way-so only the right people have access.</p><p> The tip of the pyramid is automated decision making. That's where a lot of the other buzzwords you read about are found: artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, machine learning, and natural language processing, to name a few.</p><p> How do I use technology in conjunction with data to come up with some kind of decision? A perfect representation of the pyramid would show an arrow that points back to the data layer. Frequently, after you apply different algorithms, you are going to construct new factors and metrics that you want to sit in that data layer. It is an ever-evolving feedback loop.</p><p> GARRITT: How are market participants thinking about this?</p><p> DELIKARIS: You read things like \"data is the new coal,\" and just as coal was the 18 th century fuel for the steam engine, data is the fuel that drives business today. It's used in countless applications: forecasting, ad sales, or just coming up with new ways to make decisions. A report by IBM Marketing Cloud noted an impressive statistic: 90% of the world's data was created in the last two years. Your watch and even your appliances now generate data, often called \"digital exhaust.\" Data is being created everywhere, and figuring out how to integrate it with the business decision process is where the opportunity lies.</p><p> How do I start to think about these new data points and other \"big data\" elements to answer previously unanswerable questions and enhance our preexisting understanding of the business? How do I distinguish between \"signal\" and \"noise,\" extracting the valuable insights embedded among millions of data points? How can I benefit from these different data sets? You have data that is relatively new. How do you back-test it when you only have two years' worth? That creates some interesting discussion points. Going forward, if I'm going to use this data and I can't back-test it, how do I gain confidence in the insights I derive? How will my competitors approach this?</p><p> GARRITT: There seems to be a renaissance regarding automated trading because of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Why now? Can you also give an overview of these technologies and how they are being applied?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Some people are shocked to hear that machine learning has been around since the late 1950s. What prevented it from taking off was a lack of accessible data and the processing power to analyze it. Without a sufficient amount of data, it is impossible to train these algorithms. There was also a lack of computing power to process the data and apply these sophisticated algorithms. Now we have impressive hardware that can keep up with huge amounts of data. Plus, the technology is relatively cheap. The cloud brought about a transformation by allowing anyone to get access to relatively inexpensive processing power. There hasn't been a renaissance regarding automated trading, per se. It is really more about general automation and ways to streamline things that could not be automated previously.</p><p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad umbrella, with cognitive computing in close connection. The goal is getting machines to mimic cognitive functions or human behavior. I think of machine learning, under the AI umbrella, as the brain. It processes the data and comes up with decisions. So how do I make algorithms that can look at digital transactions and then make decisions not explicitly coded to do so?</p><p> The other side of this is inputs. This is where the other cognitive portions come in. How do I digitize and structure new data that has not historically been easy to consume? Computer vision (images), speech recognition (voice), and natural language processing (text) are just a few ways for computers to digitize inputs. They allow a machine to apply algorithms, like machine learning (ML), to make dynamic decisions based on these new inputs, which would otherwise be difficult to process.</p><p> GARRITT: Outside securities finance, what has been the growth and maturity of AI within asset classes? Are certain ones more advanced? What are the uses and purposes of AI for each?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Asset classes with good data sources and transaction history are easier and first in line to use these technologies because there is enough depth to train models. Developed market equity trading is a prime example. Moving down to more opaque assets generally means less transparency and more bespoke markets. This often translates into having a harder time finding and aggregating data, which, as we have discussed, makes using technologies like AI harder.</p><p> Fixed income was a great example, but it has been getting more electronic over the last few years. Emerging markets, private equity, and venture capital are examples [of where it is] harder to apply these technologies. The data either doesn't exist, is not easily obtained, or is just hard to get in an acceptable period of time. How quickly do exchanges return the data to you? Any lag makes its use more complex.</p><p> GARRITT: One of your recurring themes is the importance of data. Is it fair to say that even if institutions are not deploying technologies like AI and machine learning, they should be collecting data now and structuring it properly?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Yes, I couldn't agree more. You need a structured solution to start capturing and curating data. At a recent conference I attended, a major discussion was around how most organizations, big and small, now have a data acquisition team, which underscores how important they view data aggregation.</p><p> The next question is whether they want the new data sets in raw or curated form. Organizations that have the talent and infrastructure to analyze data tend to want it untouched. In fact, they often think the process of analyzing and transforming the data, and constructing their own proprietary corresponding signal, is where the alpha ultimately lies.</p><p> Some organizations prefer the opposite-to get the data in relatively processed form. They might not have the ability or resources to do this process, or they may feel that end users look at and use the same data sets differently. So the alpha is less in the processing of the data and more in combining data sets in different ways to drive different results.</p><p> Many questions arise as institutions look for an edge or to keep pace: What types of data do I need? How much should I pay for it? Do I want it standardized? Implementation is a big issue, and the amount of resources you have to allocate toward this process will drive your strategy.</p><p> GARRITT: Can AI enhance risk management? And how have you had to change your processes and your governance around its usage-and maybe its risk?</p><p> DELIKARIS: AI will help risk management because it is a new way to augment the process of both detecting and managing risk. For example, anomaly detection-AI is particularly good at finding patterns in data that have been traditionally hard to detect. Why did this transaction happen, and why have we never seen one like this in the last 360 days? AI can curate a list of transactions to help figure out if something atypical is happening, which in securities lending can be used to identify transactions that tend not to settle and pose a risk, because it has looked at millions of transactions and certain trends are prevalent when things go awry.</p><p> On the flip side, how do you govern such a model? Model validation becomes extremely complex, not only because the technology is complex, but also because it is new and there is a scarcity of people that understand it well. Finding people to both implement and govern it is extremely tough, and it's a difficult issue every bank is trying to get through.</p><p> Another concern is getting clarity on how a decision is made. It's not good enough to say, \"This is the result.\" You must be able to explain why something happened and how the answer was derived. AI/ML is a more opaque system. How do you balance and reconcile the lack of transparency with the value it provides?</p><p> GARRITT: What is the role for distributed ledger technology in finance?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Where distributed ledger technology gets very interesting is when it comes to automation and, in general, the smart contracts that are implemented on top of it-places you can inject code that can make the workflow happen in a straight-through capacity. I wouldn't necessarily say smart contracts are going to apply to algorithmic trading in a traditional sense, but you will see them applied to reconciliation of transactions, which will speed up time and reduce risk during typical trades.</p><p> The workflow will become faster because the smart contract will say, \"If I have these three steps, reconciliation necessarily occurred, and I can therefore allow and automatically go to the next step.\" This will help shorten the transaction life cycle. Obviously, that is the core foundation of how all trades work, not just programmatic ones.</p><p> GARRITT: How should firms not yet in this space get started? Does it depend on their market and products?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Let me answer from an overall emerging-technology perspective, not necessarily just AI or distributed ledger. Getting started requires two core aspects. One is leadership buy-in to the idea that things are always changing and we must always be investing in the future. This will necessitate an investment in both people-and, by proxy, skill sets-and technology infrastructure. Both will take time to implement. In order to receive the full value of the technology, you need several different participants in the ecosystem to buy in. If you don't invest now, you will be left behind when the broader market adopts.</p><p> The second portion is finding the talent. Once you invest in the technology, where do you get the right people to harness it? Where are you going to find the people who sit at the intersection of finance, technology, statistics, and computer science? You need them to think creatively with these concepts in mind to bring about innovation and, ultimately, transformation. You also need them to help implement these new technologies and operating structures. We are not only competing with big tech for customers, but also for employees with these skills.</p><p> With everything becoming digital, in a sense it's all data and devising new and creative products that utilize this data. Everyone is looking for this. At State Street, we created a program called the Numerates Network that spans the entire firm to facilitate learning, mentoring, and networking and makes it easier to connect people and business groups that leverage these emerging technologies. We want easy ways for teams to be able to say to each other, \"You have an expert over there with machine learning experience and we have an immediate need for that skill set here in securities finance. Let's partner.\"</p><p> GARRITT: What are some ways technology can be leveraged throughout your firm?</p><p> DELIKARIS: The question is about how you remove some of the specifics of a particular technology implementation so you can leverage and share the main component as broadly as possible. How do I create a wheeland-spoke infrastructure, whether it's cloud or DLT, or even quantum down the line? It's difficult to get right, but to efficiently leverage technology throughout the firm, you need to break down the silos that exist with the different business lines.</p><p> To fully embrace and implement emerging technologies, change has to happen on the corporate level, not the business-unit level. Technology adoption happens with a huge fixed cost; corporate support can make or break the process by helping to attract the right talent and absorb the fixed costs over a larger base.</p><p> I heard the term \"model as a service\" recently, which I think is a great idea and similar to \"software as a service.\" In the model, we can use the same infrastructure and machine-learning algorithm in securities finance that is used in other trading products. The main difference is the inputs and slightly different use cases, but the core architecture and process are very similar.</p><p> The next question is this: Can part of our value proposition to clients be the models themselves? If we invest in these technologies and relevant talent internally, can clients benefit from the ways we derive insight and make decisions based on data? Is the model widely applicable and possibly set up to be open source? This is all facilitated by having a good structure internally-to make sure you have all the issues worked out.</p><p> GARRITT: Getting back to a term you mentioned, can you explain quantum computing?</p><p> DELIKARIS: Currently, computers run on code that is made up of zeros and ones called \"bits.\" Quantum computing's equivalent is called \"qubits,\" or quantum bits. The main difference is that qubits can be zero, one, or both at the same time, which is called superposition. Superposition allows n amount of qubits to represent all 2n states simultaneously, instead of processing one state at a time as regular bits do. In the simplest terms, it means that quantum computers can exponentially speed up the amount of certain calculations.</p><p> When quantum computing gets more mature, there will be a lot of risk with it from a legacy security perspective. For example, you can use a brute-force method to determine a password in seconds, instead of decades in the current processing power environment. Everyone is going to struggle with the implications. How are systems going to be upgraded or changed in response? How are you going to change security strategies?</p><p> GARRITT: It sounds like all those cyberrisk experts sitting in operational risk are going to become pretty important.</p><p> DELIKARIS: That's absolutely right. Hopefully, it will not be used for nefarious purposes, but whoever gets there first is going to have the ability to do a lot of things because that technology will be superior to the existing ones. How do you put guardrails around that scenario to prevent bad actors and ultimately protect yourself? A lot of companies are starting to think about it. You can start to build safety nets ahead of time, but it's hard because you don't know exactly where the technology is headed yet.</p><p> GARRITT: Thank you for sharing your perspectives with us. Is there a particular message you would like to leave with our readers?</p><p> DELIKARIS: This is an interesting time in finance because the lines are blurring between almost every type of business line. For example, consumer companies are starting to behave like finance companies, and vice versa. You have both a consolidation and a renaissance of operating models, which creates an opportunity for new ways to do business that we've never contemplated. It's relatively cheap to experiment with new technologies, and that's where you get disruption.</p><p> While somewhat scary from a traditional finance perspective, it is also exciting at the same time because things are changing so rapidly. There will be a lot of opportunity to reinvent. You're seeing it in securities finance: Transactions that used to involve hand-holding are becoming straight-through, and that has given us an opportunity to create new products and more efficient ways of doing things. Figuring out how to solve complex problems with new tools is very exciting.</p><p>\"That process is exciting because you need collaboration-different opinions and partnerships-to bring about the transformation.\"</p><p> \"It's important to forge new relationships, think about things differently, and apply those learnings.\"</p><p> Nickolas Delikaris</p><p> \"You read things like 'data is the new coal,' and just as coal was the 18th century fuel for the steam engine, data is the fuel that drives business today. It's used in countless applications: forecasting, ad sales, or just coming up with new ways to make decisions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABI-2299169566</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">42679 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-HSX1-JBWT-B08C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Robert Morris Associates Mar 2019</copyright><publicationName>The RMA Journal</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 15310558</issn><volume>Vol 101</volume><issueNumber>No. 6</issueNumber><aggregationName>ABI/INFORM</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other (Trade Journals)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Interview</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It started when someone had picked up on my blog about Ana Botin[1],where she made the comment: 'Why should data be regulated in a different way if you're called a bank and if you're called something else more than two billion people have a digital wallet. When you have a digital wallet, who should be part of that arrangement?</p><p> Just the user and the phone provider? Or the company issuing the card also? This is where we need clarity.' It got us thinking. Start with the basic relationship between a bank and their customer. The data is shared between the bank and the customer. Then you get a mobile telephone with an app. The data is still secured between the bank and the customer. Then you get PSD2 and Open Banking, requiring data sharing. Now you might share the data to embed the bank details in a mobile wallet. Then Google Pay, Apple Pay and Facebook Pay comes in and the data might be shared with Google, Apple and Facebook. Then you may also embed your bank details in PayPal, Amazon and other services. You have this complex data value chain which started with just one provider, the bank, and now may have five, six or more involved. This is where the questions arise. What happens with data dilution? What happens if there is data compromise? Who is liable and who is to blame? That's a hard conversation, and one that most banks are nervous around, even though APIs and Open Banking is secure. The nervousness is around banks losing the user. Just as in my example of challenger banks getting lifestyle spending whilst incumbent banks get just the billing, the worry is that bright firms will leverage the data and leave the old bank standing. If you're not aware of my thoughts on challengers, here's a quick repeat[2]: 'There's these new banks that are just hoovering up all of my lifestyle spending because they're so good at analysing my lifestyle data. They show me what I spend, where I spend it, when I spend it and how much I'm spending on each and every darned thing in my life. So, they've become my lifestyle bank and you've become my boring old bank for my boring old bills, like utility payments and mortgage stuff. The stuff that is important but tells you nothing about who I am or how I live my life, 'cos Monzo got all that stuff. In other words, you got the dumb data.' Now we can add Big Tech to challenger banks. Amazon is leveraging a JPMorgan Chase wallet; Citi is working with Google; Apple has Goldman Sachs behind them; and Facebook is all over everything. As The Economist [3]puts it: Silicon Valley giants are after your data, not your money. It's all about the battle over data. The more data you have on a user, the more you can target and leverage. The data provides knowledge. The digital footprint provides the lifestyle analytics. Lost that contact and you've lost everything. Now, I know I've blogged about this a lot[4], but data really is air. Data is not oil. Oil is a fossil fuel with limitations. Data is air that allows us to breathe and thrive. Lose air and you suffocate. That's what's happening with the battle between FinTech, challenger banks, Big Tech and incumbent banks. And guess what? I'm saying many incumbent banks are suffocating. They just don't know it yet.

At the top would be big banks with domestic and global presence, then the mid-sized banks, the third would be small finance banks and local cooperative banks. The fourth set of players would be digital players helping plug the crucial gap in technology, service and innovation.</p><p>\u201cThe fourth segment may consist of digital players who may act as service providers directly to customers or through banks by acting as their agents or associates,'' said Das. \u201cThe reoriented banking system will of course be characterised by a continuum of banks. The banking space would also include both traditional players with strong customer base and new technology led players.'' India is increasinglypopulated by fintech firms that are contributing to the ease of doing transactions and helping improve credit assessments. But the regulator continues to prefer banks over the innovators because of the wider financial stability issues and their capital positions. To be sure, the emergence of big tech companies in the financial services landscape of the country would pose a challenge for traditional lenders if they didn't modify business models in line with the changing technology realities. \u201cBanks are not only facing competition from fintech companies but also from large technology companies, which are entering into financial services industry in a big way,\u201d he said. The low-cost nature of their businesses and the use of big data could be harnessed to provide basic financial services to the unbanked population, he said.</p><p>\u201cThese developments pose a challenge to banks as well as banking regulators,\u201d Das said. \u201cAll these mean that the future of banking will not be a continuation of the past. We would see a very different banking sector, in terms of structure and business model, in the coming years.\u201d The financial services arms of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are already making significant headways into business subsets, such as routine payments.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_67_25022020010005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y90-72F1-JB3N-T1TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

At the top would be big banks with domestic and global presence, then the mid-sized banks, the third would be small finance banks and local cooperative banks. The fourth set of players would be digital players helping plug the crucial gap in technology, service and innovation.</p><p>\u201cThe fourth segment may consist of digital players who may act as service providers directly to customers or through banks by acting as their agents or associates,'' said Das. \u201cThe reoriented banking system will of course be characterised by a continuum of banks. The banking space would also include both traditional players with strong customer base and new technology led players.'' India is increasinglypopulated by fintech firms that are contributing to the ease of doing transactions and helping improve credit assessments. But the regulator continues to prefer banks over the innovators because of the wider financial stability issues and their capital positions. To be sure, the emergence of big tech companies in the financial services landscape of the country would pose a challenge for traditional lenders if they didn't modify business models in line with the changing technology realities. \u201cBanks are not only facing competition from fintech companies but also from large technology companies, which are entering into financial services industry in a big way,\u201d he said. The low-cost nature of their businesses and the use of big data could be harnessed to provide basic financial services to the unbanked population, he said.</p><p>\u201cThese developments pose a challenge to banks as well as banking regulators,\u201d Das said. \u201cAll these mean that the future of banking will not be a continuation of the past. We would see a very different banking sector, in terms of structure and business model, in the coming years.\u201d The financial services arms of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple are already making significant headways into business subsets, such as routine payments.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_77_25022020012004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y90-72F1-JB3N-T1NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Blyth meets Euromoney at HSBC's dedicated floor at the WeWork in Southwark, London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sofa is nestled in a recess to one side of the office and is surrounded by pictures of white sandy beaches and blue skies. Posters with bright and encouraging affirmations on them are tacked to the wall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Anyone can take a seat here, chat to colleagues or sit alone if they wish. It's a place for thinking,\" says Blyth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the way, workers in trainers and T-shirts sit at desks in the open-plan office. A state-of-the-art kitchen in one corner provides workers with micro roasted coffee, fruit water and artisanal biscuits. On another floor, there's free beer on tap, a games room and what appears to be the office dog.</p><p>The WeWork office space is a far cry from the formal, sometimes sterile, conference rooms that Euromoney is used to visiting in Canary Wharf. The relaxed working environment feels more like a fancy new fintech than a 150-year-old bank. Is this the new face of transaction banking? <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Natalie Blyth, HSBC\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Transaction banking is where tech meets finance,\" says Blyth. \"It is one of the most interesting areas of banking at the moment \"\" although I may be biased.\"Matthew Davies, head of global transaction services EMEA and global co-head of corporates sales, GTS, at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch says: \"Payments are one of the most fascinating areas in banking at the moment.\"Their investment banking colleagues may scoff at the thought, but Blyth and Davies are right.Distributed-ledger technology (DLT) supports the complete digitalization and end-to-end automation of trade. Paperless processing is possible from the outset: contractual terms and conditions between exporter and importer are agreed via smart contract on DLT platforms.Several consortia have sprung up to test the waters and banks are central to the developments.In cash management, technology has already moved the needle. Digital payments lead the way at corporates as treasurers demand the same frictionless transactions they see in personal banking.Banks, central banks and big tech are trialling cryptocurrencies and tokens to satiate this need for instant transactions.At the end of July, financial services technology company FIS merged with online payments provider WorldPay in a deal worth $43 billion \"\" one of the biggest deals ever in the payments sector. Transaction banking is where tech meets finance. It is one of the most interesting areas of banking at the moment \"\" although I may be biased\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Natalie Blyth, HSBC And when Facebook, Amazon and Google get involved in payments, it's not just the banks and regulators whose ears prick up. Everyone is interested in how this is going to pan out because it could impact everybody.\"Trade finance and cash management solutions are evolving quickly because our customers demand it within this current context,\" says Ebru Pakcan, head of treasury and trade solutions, EMEA, at Citi. \"It is fast paced and continues to gain momentum.\"This is a moment when the nature of business is changing: for consumers, there are online and instant options for everyday needs, from ordering a takeaway to booking a taxi; and transaction bankers are the ones helping these types of businesses manage their money.At the same time, banks themselves need to innovate and become as nimble as the companies they serve. The entire industry is in flux. Soaring investmentBecause technology has the ability to transform transaction banking, investment there is soaring.Take Deutsche Bank for example. While the German bank has shed its equity sales and trading business, its transaction banking business has been firmly integrated into its corporate banking business under Stefan Hoops \"\" at 39 years old, one of the brightest transaction bankers in the business.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs is entering cash management after the successful roll out of its online savings product Marcus. In February this year, the Financial Times reported that the bank hired 100 new staffers for its cash management business, due to launch in 2020.Incumbents including Citi, HSBC and JPMorgan \"\" the top three in Coalition's transaction banking league table, in that order, for 2018 \"\" continue to invest steadily in the sector. Regional players including Standard Chartered, DBS, BNP Paribas and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have all maintained their commitment to transaction banking. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Matthew Davies, BAML\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>To keep up with the investment and technological developments, banks are hiring new talent. Economics and financial graduates are still part of the mix, but so are computer scientists, engineers, coders and a whole host of other tech-related jobs.\"Ten years ago, our summer intake was all mainly interested in joining investment banking teams \"\" our team barely got a look in,\" says Davies at BAML. \"That trend has now reversed.\"Sungmahn Seo, managing director, head of EMEA payments and foreign exchange for treasury services at JPMorgan, says: \"What was once seen as something old and clunky is no more, and people want to be part of that change.\"It is also one of the more inclusive areas of banking. At HSBC, for example, the two most senior transaction bankers are women \"\" Blyth and Diane Reyes, who is head of global liquidity and cash management at HSBC.The duo's success was highlighted in Euromoney's cash management and trade finance surveys this year, where HSBC took the top spot globally in both surveys.At Standard Chartered, Lisa Robins leads the transaction banking team after taking up the role in February this year.At Lloyds Bank, Andrea Melville is managing director, commercialization and propositions, while Gwynne Master is global head of trade.The managing director for treasury services at JPMorgan is Alison Livesey.And at Citi, along with Pakcan, Ireti Samuel-Ogbu is EMEA head of payments and Magda Mielcarz is EMEA head of digital channels.In fact, for this feature, Euromoney spoke to equal numbers of women and men.There is, as always, more to do.\"Transaction banking in general is an area of financial services where gender balance is among the best. However, as elsewhere, women are the most likely to be working in junior roles,\" says Blyth.\"For this reason it is critical that across the industry we support efforts to build the talent pipeline of future leaders, making sure that there are women included and that they receive the appropriate support to reach their goals,\" she says. \"We're fortunate that at HSBC the two most senior roles in transaction banking are held by women. I'm hoping this can act as an inspiration to women in the business who want to progress their careers.\" We all know each other. I think this helps when it comes to moving the industry forward, because at the end of the day we all have the same goal: to bring transaction banking into the 21st century\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Matthew Davies, BAML And given the central position that transaction banking is gaining, some bankers believe that these are the people that will lead the banks in the future.There are some signs that this is already happening. One of the roles that DBS' chief executive Piyush Gupta held before taking the reins at the bank was as regional director for global transaction services for Asia Pacific.\"I think we will increasingly see more client-facing bankers take the most senior positions at banks, as opposed to traders and sales people,\" says one transaction banker based in London.\"The industry has started to focus on the importance of transaction banking as being fundamental to relationships and driving growth \"\" so it's only a matter of time before we see global transaction bankers leading banks on a wider scale,\" says Robins at Standard Chartered.\"We provide value-added solutions and services that support companies' fundamental financial needs,\" she says. \"We fuel the real economy \"\" something that is becoming increasingly apparent and important. But there's always more to do to get our story across.\"And transaction bankers are a close knit community.\"We all know each other,\" says Davies. \"I think this helps when it comes to moving the industry forward, because at the end of the day we all have the same goal: to bring transaction banking into the 21st century.\" Attracting talentBut how can you attract the best tech talent when new and nimble fintech companies and the large tech incumbents look to hire the same people to roll out their own online payment, mobile wallet or supply-chain finance businesses?In May, Facebook announced plans to launch cryptocurrency Libra, powered by blockchain. In August, Apple launched its own credit card, initially designed to be used alongside Apple Pay on Apple devices. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sungmahn Seo, JPMorgan\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>For the last four years, Amazon has offered supply-chain finance across a number of countries and Google has its own digital wallet. In Asia, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial is the highest-valued fintech company in the world and offers a variety of financial products to users without needing to open a bank account.Then add to this the dozens of new fintech startups that launch each month. They might not have the clout of the big banks or big tech, but the money is there. According to research by data provider CB Insights, globally, fintech companies raised a record $39.6 billion in 2018, up 120% on the previous year.\"The banks' offering is different,\" says Seo at JPMorgan. \"We already have a customer base \"\" something that smaller fintechs don't necessarily have \"\" which means we are able to rapidly scale out our businesses a lot faster.\"Then think about JPMorgan specifically and how big our tech division actually is. We have around 50,000 people in it, so in that respect we act like a big tech company anyway,\" he says.In comparison, Facebook has around 36,000 employees and Google has over 100,000.Banks are also keen to highlight that while there may have been some pressure put on them when fintechs entered the payments and trade finance space around five years ago, the feeling towards them has changed. We already have a customer base \"\" something that smaller fintechs don't necessarily have\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Sungmahn Seo, JPMorgan \"You can see more and more fintechs seeking to white-label their products,\" says John Laurens, head of transaction banking at DBS based in Singapore.\"The smaller fintechs can see that while they might be able to develop technology to create their own propositions, the time required to acquire customers is often a challenge for them,\" he says. \"They therefore increasingly seek new avenues to generate revenue by offering their capabilities to banks in the region that may be digital laggards.\"And then there are all the tools and products that banks seem to give away. At DBS, anyone can sign up to DBS Treasury Prism online, which helps corporates find the right cash-management solutions. As Blyth at HSBC says, the bank is happy to share codes and application program interfaces (APIs) with the market in general.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Burcu Senel, HSBC\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"We have to if we are serious about leading the industry forward,\" she says.Banks have even set up innovation labs and accelerator programmes to support their work with the fintechs.Stuart Riley, global head of Citi's institutional client group, technology and operations, says: \"We set up our labs in\u00a0Tel Aviv, Dublin and Singapore to nurture some of the fintech talent we have seen out there. In some instances, this will be tech that we can use to benefit our own business, in other cases it won't.\"It's not about profiting from our partners\" he says. \"It's about building a network of partners and talent that can help us solve complex problems for us and our clients.\"And the banks have a lot of their own talent to leverage in any case.Last year, Burcu Senel moved from investment banking to work with Blyth's trade finance team at HSBC. Senel is now global head of propositions for global trade and receivables finance for the bank. Think about how issues such as the trade war between China and the US and Brexit have dominated the news recently \"\" we are the bankers central to navigating these issues\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Burcu Senel, HSBC \"I was drawn to transaction services because the business is so multidimensional,\" she says. \"We get to harness to state-of-the-art technology and help clients navigate diverse political and economic landscapes. Think about how issues such as the trade war between China and the US and Brexit have dominated the news recently \"\" we are the bankers central to navigating these issues. How do you facilitate trade when trade tensions accelerate the evolution of supply chains? How do you manage cash when there are foreign-exchange controls in place? It is quite a strategic job, which has been overlooked in the past.\"Would Senel move back to the investment banking arm of the bank?\"Put it this way: I've got a lot more exciting opportunities to explore,\" she says. Higher returnsDespite all the collaboration, the banks are plainly reluctant to give up trade finance and cash management revenue to new players. And there is a lot to lose.According to Coalition, total revenue for fixed income, currencies and commodities, investment banking and equities for the 12 largest banks it covers fell from $167.2 billion in 2013 to $150.9 billion in 2017, although the trend reversed and made a slight recovery in 2018 to $151.4 billion.Meanwhile, in transaction banking, revenue grew from $27.4 billion in 2016 to $28.8 billion in 2017 and $31.3 billion in 2018 for the 10 banks covered by Coalition.On average, the return on equity for transaction banking grew from 21% in 2016 to 26% in 2018. In investment banking, ROE was around the 8% mark for 2018.What does all this mean?\"It's obvious,\" says Eric Li, Coalition's research director. \"Transaction banking has higher returns than investment banking, for sure.\"In 2018, Citi's treasury and trade solutions business revenue was $9.3 billion \"\" one quarter of the total revenue of the bank's institutional clients group. At Deutsche Bank, its global transaction banking revenue was \u00e2,\u00ac3.8 billion for the same year; at HSBC, it was $11.1 billion.At JPMorgan, the bank's revenue in treasury services for corporate investment banking and commercial banking combined hit $8.8 billion. At BAML, global transaction banking revenue was $7.9 billion.   All of the banks measure their transaction banking revenue slightly differently, but nevertheless these are big numbers \"\" numbers that have sustained the banks while tougher regulatory requirements scupper profits from investment banking.\"Generally speaking, transaction banking isn't as risky as investment banking or trading, and so after the financial crisis, banks turned their attention to trade finance and cash management as regulation around investment banking grew,\" says Davies from BAML.\"This isn't to say that this regulation doesn't affect us,\" he says. \"Basel III, for instance, makes it harder to access short-term liquidity for trade-finance products, despite the fact that trade finance is pretty low risk. It would benefit us if regulators looked at trade finance as a separate asset class, actually, but it still hasn't limited us as much as it has with investment banking.\"Pakcan at Citi says: \"Capital requirements have been increasing since the financial crisis, so return dynamics are even more important.\"Transaction banking by definition is more about the products offered. These products usually have an affixed cost to them, so returns are stronger. This is another reason to focus on this business.\" Sticky businessMoreover, transaction banking is a \"~sticky' business and banks are able to sell a number of other products following their engagement with corporate clients through cash management and trade finance.\"Investment bankers can be greatly assisted when transaction bankers do their job well,\" says Davies. \"If you support a company's real growth using trade finance and cash management tools tailored for them, they will eventually turn to your bank for debt and equity raising or M&amp;A.\"Now the regulatory burden that has allowed transaction banking to come to the fore might actually dampen the challenge from big tech. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Alison Livesey, JPMorgan</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Technology creates a lot of opportunities for us, but it also creates a number of entry points for challengers to come in,\" says Naveed Sultan, global head of treasury and trade solutions at Citi. \"But saying this, I don't think the big tech companies want to come under the same regulatory regime as current financial institutions do.\"Social media, online retail outlets and media agencies have all been under greater scrutiny in recent years. But dealing with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation is one thing, dealing with the US Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank is quite another.\"The banks have evolved along with the regulatory regimes around the world,\" says Sultan. \"Banks are very accustomed to working with regulators to achieve a balance between regulation and self-regulation to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system, and yet provide impetus to economic growth.\"As to big tech companies, regulation is still evolving \"\" we will have to see where and how it settles.\"After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, will customers trust Facebook and others like them with their payments data?\"Following the financial crisis, some people did lose confidence in the banking industry to some extent, but I think generally people are quite satisfied that their data is safer with us than others,\" says Benoit Desserre, head of global transaction banking at Societe Generale.\"We have built everything we have on trust,\" he says. \"It takes a lot of time and effort to build and retain trust when it comes to your money.\"There were similar discussions after the emergence of digital-only challenger banks. The idea that Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank and numerous other online banks would disintermediate the banks has come and gone.\"At the individual level,\" says Seo at JPMorgan, \"we are at the stage where some people will open accounts with new online banks, but they also keep an account open with one of the more traditional banks as well. From what we see, they appear to prefer to have multiple bank accounts.\"The limitations here aren't as much to do with data protection or regulation, but with the challengers' capacity to support companies as their businesses develop. The technology allows us to develop. While regulation has limited other areas of banking, the relationships we build via transaction banking can lead to much, much more business\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Alison Livesey, JPMorgan Seo adds: \"When it comes to corporate banking, however, small and medium-sized enterprises might move to one of the newer, online players to meet their needs, but larger institutions will feel more comfortable working with a bank that has a track record as well as regional and international connectivity. People are happy using one or more banks' payment platforms to get the best deal.\"Davies at BAML says: \"Technology companies and challenger banks bring in new capabilities \"\" which is fantastic because it keeps us all on our toes \"\" but this is by and large focused on the retail space and to a lesser extent on corporate banking.\"Yes, legacy infrastructure might hold some banks back, but it also shows how long we have been in the business for,\" he says. \"We understand regulation and different legal frameworks of various geographies, something that tech companies and challenger banks with ambitions in this space may find difficult to get their heads around.\"Livesey at JPMorgan says: \"The technology allows us to develop. While regulation has limited other areas of banking, the relationships we build via transaction banking can lead to much, much more business. These factors have all aligned in the last five years to push transaction banking to centre stage \"\" but I think banks are the experts when it comes to navigating the landscape, because of our experience in the industry.\"We will disrupt ourselves,\" she adds. Fragmented offeringIn transaction banking, experience counts for a lot. It is a diverse, innovative business to be in, and if you want to work at the intersection between finance and tech, banks are the place to be. But the challenge from big technology companies, fintech and digital banks looms large, and has created a fragmented offering for individuals and corporates alike.As Laurens at DBS highlights, banks themselves use the services of other fintechs and white-label their products. Banks also piggyback payment platforms when building the infrastructure themselves proves difficult and expensive. And as illustrated by the challenger banks, people are willing to shop around \"\" especially when it takes just a few seconds to open a new bank account or access other financial products. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Eric Li, Coalition\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>But what does this all mean for the corporate treasurer?</p><p>\"At its core, the use of technology in transaction banking is meant to streamline treasury solutions, but right now it feels as if the opposite is true,\" says Tim de Knegt, manager, strategic finance and treasury at the Port of Rotterdam.</p><p>\"As more products go online, we are able to self-solution,\" he says. \"And while that can be a good thing, when we come against new challenges, it can be hard to speak to an individual at a bank to help us with those challenges. The role of the relationship manager is becoming obsolete from a banks' internal perspective as services move online, but the reduction of strategic engagement forces us to look for alternatives for our [transaction] banking needs.</p><p>\"Then the more the banks digitize, the cheaper the offering becomes,\" says de Knegt. \"For me, it feels like it is a race to the bottom in terms for the banks \"\" they worry more about their profit margins rather than supporting value creation for their clients.\"</p><p>Banks will often deny that this is the case. For them, all the technology, collaboration with fintechs and consortia is aimed towards transaction banking's greater good. They are in it for long-term development and not the short term-gain. But the fact remains that while the technology aim is to create a one-stop-shop for corporates, this is still far from reality.</p><p>So the next step, says Citi's Sultan, is\u00a0consolidation: \"We saw it with the big online retailers and search engines. Ten to 15 years ago, these segments were also quite fragmented, but this changed over time, and now we have a few companies that dominate these areas. This is what I think will happen in transaction banking.</p><p> If you are a small regional bank, where do you go from here? You white-label, you merge with another bank or your transaction banking business is acquired\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Eric Li, Coalition </p><p>\"Fragmentation is inevitable as the business transitions,\" he says. \"But as companies' needs become more global, they will require a global platform to support them. Banks do have the competitive advantage in this respect \"\" they have the global connectivity \"\" but bringing all products onto one platform is a tough challenge, a challenge we take very seriously.</p><p>Davies at BAML says: \"Think about it this way: 60% of the Fortune 500 won't exist in the next 10 years because of consolidation and changes in technology. The companies that will replace them will be digital and the banks that serve them will be digital too.\"</p><p>Li from Coalition asks: \"If you are a small regional bank, where do you go from here? You white-label, you merge with another bank or your transaction banking business is acquired. They just cannot compete with the large international banks when it comes to infrastructure and tech investment, so they will eventually lose out.\"</p><p>Euromoney looked at the transaction banking revenue for the five largest transaction banking earners, according to Coalition, minus the French banks, which do not report their transaction banking numbers separately.</p><p>Each bank reports their transaction banking revenue slightly differently, however. For instance, Deutsche Bank includes institutional cash and securities services revenues in their global transaction services revenues.</p><p>But there is still value in the numbers because they illustrate trends in revenue share. And for the banks analyzed, they haven't gained market share over the last five years.</p><p>At Citi, percentage share of total revenue fell slightly from 23% to 22% between 2014 and 2018. For HSBC, revenue share grew from 25% to 27%. At JPMorgan, the revenue share grew from 19% to 21%; at BAML the revenue share has stayed the same for the last five years at 19%; and for Deutsche it has fallen from 15% to 11%.   </p><p/><p/><p>\"Gaining market share while the industry is so fragmented is difficult,\" says Desserre at SocGen. \"Yes it is a sticky business, but can we be sure this will always be the case when there is so much change going on?</p><p>\"I would argue that one of the biggest transitions we see in transaction banking is one towards more speed and transparency: Swift gpi for instance means that customers can track money transfers at every stage \"\" it is closing the gap on \"~instant'. The second Payments Services Directive will do the same. This is driving the industry right now and actually has the potential to create further fragmentation in the industry.</p><p>\"People will consider costs and may move around more than we initially thought,\" he says. \"In the short to medium term, we are much more likely to see a split between new and old banks for corporates' transaction banking needs, given the considerable investments that this business does and will continue to require.\"</p><p>And should this even be the end goal?</p><p>\"Unlike investment banking, where there are a few outright winners in terms of gaining market share, transaction banking is a completely different animal,\" says Li at Coalition. \"We are seeing certain trends emerge, for sure \"\" for instance, the strength of the American banks in the recent periods versus the European banks \"\" but when it comes to gaining market share? It is less of a focus as the overall industry continues to grow. The pie is getting bigger, and this will benefit everyone.</p><p>\"While it might feel like transaction banking is moving a lot quicker, in reality, to get a large deal done, \"\" such as supply chain finance \"\" it can still take a few months at a time,\" he adds. \"So any gains in market share will take some time to come to fruition in any case.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1hj1kbhgb56t5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCD-8061-JD1P-T2MG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4420\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Good morning, everyone and welcome to TransAlta's 2019 Investor Day here in Toronto. We're so happy to be here with you all.</p><p>My name is Chiara Valentini for those that -- who don't know me. And I am the Manager of Investor Relations here at TransAlta. I would like to inform you all that today's presentation will be webcast and recorded. I invite those listening along to view the supporting slides, which are now available on our website. An audio replay of the presentation will be available later along with a transcript. That will be posted on our website shortly, thereafter, as well. Before we start the presentation, I would like the audience in the room to take note of the following safety messages. There are 2 exits to this room, one at the front and one at the back. In the event that there is an emergency, kindly proceed to the exit nearest to you and make your way to the corridor next to our meeting room. The emergency exit stairwell is located in this corridor, next to the women's washroom. This stairwell will take you down to the ground floor on Pearl Street. From there make your way to St. Andrew's Church, which is on the southwest corner of King Street and University Avenue. This is the vantage building designated muster point.</p><p>I will now turn to our advisory on forward-looking statements. As we begin our session, I would like you to note that this presentation includes a number of forward-looking statements, which are based on a number of assumptions and subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Many of which are set forth on this slide behind me. I would encourage you to read it subsequently at your convenience. This presentation contains references to non-IFRS measures, such measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Information regarding these non-IFRS measures can be found within this presentation and also within our annual and quarterly MD&amp;A report.</p><p>And so without further delay, I would like to introduce Dawn Farrell, President and Chief Executive Officer of TransAlta and welcome her to the podium. She will start us off with panel introductions and kick off our session with an overview of our agenda. Welcome, Dawn.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; CORPORATE DIRECTOR, TRANSALTA CORPORATION: Thanks Chiara, and welcome everyone and thanks for all of you for coming out to -- today. I am going to start with some introductions of the team and I'll walk through the agenda. I am going to do a bit brief overview of TransAlta for those of you that don't know us well, so for those of you that do, just bear with me, it won't take that long. And then I'll get into the meat of what we're here to talk about today, which is our strategy.</p><p>So today, of course, we have John Kousinioris with us. He's our Chief Operating Officer. His primary focus now at the company is to consolidate the business under a single team as it moves to a simpler operation, and, of course, you'll hear about that today. Today he's going to take you through our views of the market fundamentals in Alberta. He'll touch on Ontario. And he'll also give you an overview of these existing operations in the work that they're doing there. Many of you know Brett Gellner. He's our Chief Development Officer. He's working on the projects for the future, and under his leadership we've developed our coal to gas conversion strategy and we're pursuing a pipeline -- a solid pipeline of unique investment opportunities. He's joined by Wayne Collins. Wayne is our Executive Vice President of Generation. As some of you know Wayne as the brains behind our stronger performance at our Alberta coal fleet, and he recently transitioned the PPA -- the Sundance units after PPAs in Alberta very, very successfully.</p><p>Now together, Brett and Wayne are going to take you through our plans for converting our Alberta coal fleet to gas by 2025, actually by the end of 2024 and the very beginning of 2025.</p><p>Aron Willis is our Senior Vice President of Growth. Some of you have seen him a while ago when he was in his role as our General Manager of Australia. So he's back now in Canada and he's focused on working with Brett to prospect, develop, buy, build and contract new generation plants here in Canada, in the United States and in Australia. He's going to walk you through our development pipeline, our focus for renewables growth and our plans for delivering some onsite cogeneration. And he'll also update you on the construction projects that we currently have underway.</p><p>We -- and then, of course, we have Todd Stack. He was appointed our Chief Financial Officer in May, and he's going to show you how we're going to finance our transition. Now I've worked with Todd for over 25 years now. He has extensive background in the industry, including engineering, development, treasury and most recently as our Corporate Controller. That makes him a fantastic partner for ensuring that we can successfully finance the transition that we'll take you through.</p><p>We are going to have a short break between Brett and Aron, and we'll have a Q&amp;A at the end of the session. So let's get started.</p><p>So I want to start with why invest in TransAlta? So we're very, very excited to be here today to rollout the execution plan that underpins the strategy that we communicated to you in September -- or December of 2017. And on this first slide, you'll see that by the end of 2025, TransAlta's fleet will be 100% clean energy. You're also going to hear today that our execution plan is deep and is well underway. And this is great news for you, our shareholders.</p><p>Today, we're outlining our clean energy investment plan that has strong and lasting returns, and it has significant upside potential. Our investment path enables us to continue to be a low cost, and cornerstone player in the Alberta power market. And in addition, the way that we've designed this plan, we now have the financial capability to also grow our gas and renewables business. Our plan will be executed while keeping our balance sheet strong, and this is going to be done by using the funds we raised earlier this year and those that will be generated from the base business. We do have a strong culture, which is focused on execution and today you'll hear that we have all the major building blocks in place to be successful.</p><p>So the leadership team at TransAlta is passionate about our investment strategy and believe this is a great time to be an equity holder in the business.</p><p>So just for a few of you that don't know us, let me start by reminding you just briefly who we are. We are a leader in clean energy, with a serious commitment to sustainable future. Our mission is to provide safe, low-cost, reliable and clean energy. And most importantly, our employees have embraced innovation, safety and sustainability, and they incorporate these values into all of their decisions and all of our decisions. Their determination to create a respectful workplace where personal integrity is the price of entry helps us to drive results that are both sustainable and lasting.</p><p>Now today we own and operate 71 facilities across 3 countries in 5 fuel technologies. Our marketing and trading group optimizes cash flows in markets where we have merchant supply, and we generate electricity today using coal, natural gas, wind, water and the sun, and of course, by 2025 we will no longer be using coal as a primary feedstock.</p><p>We do love the diversification of technology, markets, customers and the optionality of selling megawatts from our plants to both markets and customers. And by the end of 2021, our coal fleet will be well on its way to gas with only 32% of the fleet remaining on coal. As we roll off the remaining PPAs in Alberta at the end of 2020, the 62% of our megawatts in the Alberta market simply became more valuable.</p><p>So today, today we'll be presenting our company in a very simple way so you can see where we are driving value. We operate 1 TransAlta, with a single operating model for all our plants, trading, marketing and our shared services operation. We have a consolidated growth team with a consistent approach to development, acquisition and construction and by focusing on our leadership, our leadership on driving value from each of our assets in each of our markets we drive value for TransAlta shareholders. Now like others we do have many companies and joint venture relationships underneath the TransAlta banner. The business arrangement that gets the most attention is TransAlta Renewables. Most of the projects that are in Renewables were originally developed and built in TransAlta. And by selling these assets to Renewables, we were able to create significant value for TransAlta shareholders. Having TransAlta Renewables as a financing vehicle, for long-term contracted gas and renewable projects allows us to attract additional sources of low-cost capital. You know and we know that we always have questions from investors about the relationship between TransAlta and TransAlta Renewables. And if there are benefits to having the 2 companies under a single operating model, and by the time you leave today, you'll be convinced that a single operating model is not only smart, but is competitive.</p><p>Moreover we'll outline our newly announced dividend policy for TransAlta Corporation, and we'll be presenting information regarding our capital allocation for TransAlta on a deconsolidated basis. And this will help your -- help our investors see how the dividends from TransAlta Renewables flow through to the capital allocation decisions at TransAlta.</p><p>Since we last updated you in 2017, we've delivered on many fronts to support the execution of the strategy that we're presenting today. We are proud to say that we generated a record free cash flow of $367 million in 2018 and this was before the additional $157 million of PPA termination proceeds that we received from the Balancing Pool. We also received an additional $58 million in funds in August of this year, after winning an arbitration for the recovery of the mining assets under those PPAs. Our Greenlight program has been a keystone of our transformation, driving innovation across the company and adding more than $70 million of value to our bottom line.</p><p>We are here today, to put a final bow on our coal to gas transition. Our gas pipeline is now built and commissioned, and is putting us well ahead in that strategy. Today, we're going to show you how we've adapted our plan to take advantage of the decision to continue with an energy-only market in Alberta. We did -- we also acquired a 100% of Keephills 3, so that we now have maximum flexibility for timing our conversions. Today, Brett and Wayne will outline a clear plan and will provide estimates of EBITDA under various prices for our repowering strategy in Alberta. You'll see that we pivoted our strategy towards repowered combined cycle plans to account for the decision to stay within energy-only market in the Alberta power system.</p><p>Our clean energy investment plan positions the Alberta business to be very competitive and it is a key driver of the value proposition that we are presenting here today. Now in terms of our renewables growth strategy, we have secured 3 additional wind farms in the U.S. and a new wind farm in Alberta. These projects come with quality counterparties and stable long-term cash flows. And we do expect shortly to announce our first new small on-site cogeneration project. And Aron will show you how we're developing that business.</p><p>On the capital front, we've reduced the TransAlta corporate debt by $323 million, we've improved our credit position and our balance sheet significantly. In addition, we secured $750 million of capital from Brookfield, in the form of a strategic relationship that has added expertise to our Board and Brookfield as a cornerstone shareholder. This funding allows us to buy back up to $250 million of shares, accelerate our coal to gas transition and achieve $1.2 billion in senior bonds by the end of 2020. And these are all extremely important pieces of our execution plan.</p><p>So today you're going to see that we are positioned for the energy-only market in Alberta. It's no secret that TransAlta's fleet is significant in the Alberta market. Our generation base is twice the size of the next largest player. The good news is, that our fleet is diversified between thermal and renewables and that is needed for reliability for the province. It's also no secret that our view was that a capacity market offered strong benefits to customers and the system in a world that increasingly favors renewable generation. A key foundation of our strategy at the company is to ensure that Alberta power prices remain low and competitive, and this has been a value in the company since 1911. And it's also important to -- and it's also an important value for us to ensure that our investors achieve returns that match the risk of reinvesting in our fleet, in our home market. The shift back to an energy-only market required us to pivot our strategy, and because we now have all the building blocks in place, we were able to do that. A combination of the right carbon policy federally and provincially, our ability to build the Pioneer Pipeline early, our ability to raise cash earlier this year and frankly, the engineering and operational talent in our team enabled us to pivot our plan to allow us to continue supplying clean and competitive low-cost energy to our home market. A large part of a lift in value that we expect is because we have a very clear and sensible plan to reinvest in assets, in our home market we have organic growth. Most of the elements of our plan are in our control and will emerge because we can take the lead.</p><p>Now when Aron profiles our growth strategy for new gas and renewables, you should walk away confident in our ability to find great projects with great returns. He'll show you a slide that will convince you that our growth plans are backed up by our track record. This slide here, is further evidence that we have the track record to achieve our goal as a leader in clean energy in both gas and renewables developments by the end of 2025. It shows that since 2008, we've more than tripled our EBITDA in renewables. It is very difficult for Canadian investors to buy into a position in the quickly growing renewables market. There aren't a lot of investments here in Canada because of the high degree of public-sector ownership of our utilities.</p><p>Our ability to grow our portfolio of strong, contracted gas and renewables investments makes us one of the few companies in Canada that can give investors a position in what is becoming a very, very exciting space. Now there's quite a few of these days over ESG metrics as investors really try to get under all the disclosures that are necessary to understand the true value and risk of cash flows in companies. Now sustainable development is not new to us. I've personally been working on this file since 1987. In 1990, 30 years ago, we were the first Canadian company to purchase carbon offsets. And in 2000, we were an early adopter of wind technology.</p><p>Today, we've amassed the largest wind fleet in Canada and we've achieved a lot of that growth over the past 15 years. As electric -- electricity technology has moved from hydro to coal to gas to wind to solar and it's now on its way to batteries and storage, there is always -- we've always been there and we've always had an offering to our customers. TransAlta has reported its sustainability measures since the early '90s. And 4 years ago, we chose to go to integrated reporting well ahead of all of our peers in the market. All of our ESG measures are verified by Ernst &amp; Young, and there is an array of measurements we track in our report.</p><p>Not only do we track greenhouse gases and air emissions, but we also look at things and set goals around water use intensity, waste management and landfill usage. For today, we've presented just a few key measures, including the diversity of our management team and our Board, our greenhouse gas emissions and our safety performance. And we proud ourselves in our progressive plans and the results on all these fronts. And we do know from talking to investors that making progress on all of our goals is important.</p><p>We also test our practices externally, and are reporting against standards that are set by people outside of us. We look to the CDP, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. And I can say that getting a B score with CDP, with our coal plants shows you just how much work we've done to create a very credible and strong set of ESG disclosures.</p><p>The past 3 years for us have been about driving financial performance within a very strong ESG framework. Our key financial metric for performance is free cash flow and free cash flow per share, and those of you who know us, know that to be the case. And this is the cash that really truly is left over to either repay debt, grow or return it to you, our shareholders. We've grown our free cash flow over the past 3 years and the market has rewarded us for that growth. That growth is showing in the chart on the left.</p><p>Okay. That's it for the overview. So why are we here? For all of you who are going, please stop, we know, we know. We -- today you're going to hear from the team that we have a comprehensive plan that allows us to make some great investments, continue to return cash to shareholders, achieve our balance sheet goals and continue to generate strong cash from our base business. We've pivoted our Alberta investment plans towards repowered combined cycle plants, to increase our competitiveness and generate cash in our home market.</p><p>We have great prospects in gas and renewables space. And we're the company to invest in if you want to be part of a market that is expanding and growing. And our priorities are simple. Our first priority is to invest between $600 million and $1.2 billion in our Alberta Thermal fleet to set it up for the future. The second is to complete over $800 million of construction projects that we have underway today on time and on budget. Our third is to grow our on-site and cogeneration business. Fourth, we have a team focused on building a pipeline of renewables and cogeneration projects in the U.S. Projects that will grow RNW, utilize this stack capacity and further -- and deliver further dividends back to TransAlta shareholders.</p><p>Finally, we will do all of this while running a strong base business that generates the cash to fund the growth, keep our debt inside a 3x debt to EBITDA ratio and allow us to continue to pay and to start to grow our dividend. Todd is going to show you in his section, how we can do all of this together in our comprehensive plan.</p><p>Today, we are announcing that we are ready to deploy between $1.4 billion and $2 billion over the next 5 years in gas and renewables. It is the right bet, it's at the right time and it's for the right market. It's the capital that achieves our goal of becoming a competitive gas and renewables company by the end of 2025 and it has strong returns. By the end of 2021, we will have deployed over $800 million to contract of renewables projects and small cogeneration projects that we'll announce soon. By the end of 2023, we'll have our simple boiler conversions and 1 of our repowered combined cycle conversions complete. And by the end of 2024, we'll have a second repowered combined cycle unit completed or an additional boiler conversion finished depending on what we see as are the market conditions.</p><p>You'll hear from the team today that we're ready to go, we have many of the pieces lined up, and in place and ready to deploy.</p><p>Finally, you'll see that our pivot towards a more competitive strategy in an energy-only market will make us the most competitive generator in Alberta. You'll hear from Todd that our plan is funded. You'll see that a strong balance sheet underpins our plan and we have contingencies built-in, in the event that conditions change. Todd will show you that he'll tether the investment strategy to a strong balance sheet and a dividend policy that allows investors to benefit as we move through the plan. And the plan continues to allow us to invest in ourselves by using up to $250 million in share repurchase over the next 3 years.</p><p>He'll also show you how cash at RNW is being used to increase returns for TransAlta shareholders. Today, the dividend from RNW is being reinvested in Alberta at high returns. Tomorrow, the free cash flow generated from Alberta will support the growth in additional contracted renewables and will potentially grow your dividend.</p><p>So listen, I wouldn't be a Canadian CEO if I weren't complaining about the value of the company relative to its benefits, however, I am not going to complain. What I'm going to do is tell you that the coal plant transition to gas as our coal plants transition to gas, the company simply becomes more valuable. Although Alberta is a merchant market, it is small, it's fairly close and we have a key portfolio of assets. The new policies for converted units in Canada allows to extend the lives of those assets. Our Alberta portfolio is diverse, which helps us stabilize cash flows from our Alberta business. And finally, although that PPA's created more stable cash flows, they were set in 2000 based on cost of service models and they resetted a very low level.</p><p>As the PPAs role off post 2020, we moved to market pricing, which will give us sufficient cash for returns to investors and for reinvestment in reliable supply. And you're going to see today that the expected pricing in the Alberta market potentially lifts the value of your company. From this chart, you can see the market is in valuing our cash flows, and Todd will take you through this math in his section.</p><p>As we're on our way to deliver our clean energy investment plan, we think there is an excellent opportunity here for an attractive investment given our current valuations. So why is that? It's because we have a very competitive Alberta business, and we have developed a fantastic reinvestment strategy in Alberta that continues -- will continue to create cash for a long time forward. And as you know, everything globally is moving towards electricity and electrification. Electricity is going to supply the energy demands of the world and the requirements for the future. Alberta is one of the only markets in Canada where you can have an investment in electricity. And we're an important player in electricity and power, and we've put together, what I think, is a fantastic reinvestment program for the company. More importantly, we are well ahead in the renewable space. Everything is pointing towards massive investment in renewables globally. Here in Canada, your opportunities are limited. Electricity investment is primarily owned by the Crown corporations. We are going to see a massive shift towards renewables and batteries here in Canada and elsewhere, and if you invest in TransAlta, you'll get to be a part of that important shift in how electricity is produced for customers worldwide. Finally, today we announced a very disciplined capital allocation strategy. You know that over the next 3 years, we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders through the share buyback of up to $250 million. But at the same time, when we look at the ongoing cash that we're going to generate through this investment plan, we can see our way through to both investing in this plan and paying you as we go, which is where our dividend policy comes in today. We are very excited to have been able to land a whole package here today to talk to you about so you can see where all the elements of the capital allocation strategy are and how they all fit together. I would say it's the most disciplined in the industry because we don't just look at some ratio, we in fact, what we do is look at the need for cash for debt repayment, for dividends, for preferred share dividends, for sustaining capital and of course, as well for the excess cash that we have left over to reinvest in your company and grow it.</p><p>So with that, I think just kind of ending up, most of all, you only really invest in a company because you invest in the team. We have over 175 years of combined experience and a top team of people who are diverse in their views, believe me, diverse in their capabilities, their skills and their knowledge. We have created an environment of innovation, where work ethic and creativity stand side by side so that we can lead into the future. As a team, we have the courage to make the changes that are required to ensure the company is competitive and we're good at seeking out investments that are profitable for you. We believe we set the trends and we definitely do not follow them. And we figured out how to beat the disadvantages of hierarchy by networking the organization around the projects that will matter most to adding value to your holdings. So with that, I'm going to turn the podium over to John to talk about the Alberta market.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS, COO &amp; CHIEF GROWTH OFFICER, TRANSALTA CORPORATION: Thank you, Dawn, and good morning, everyone. My name is John Kousinioris, and I'm the Chief Operating Officer of the company, and I'm very pleased to be with you all this morning. I'll be providing you with an overview of key market fundamentals that impact our business as well as a general overview of our operations.</p><p>Market fundamentals, particularly in Alberta have been influx for a number of years, but things have fundamentally changed recently, we believe, for the better. We have market structure certainty now. We believe that we're going to have carbon pricing certainty shortly, and we believe that supply and demand fundamentals will drive pricing and supply additions in the years to come. We also believe that the evolution of the market is highly constructive for our company given the scope and scale of our fleet and its competitiveness in terms of its overall low variable cost and heat rate, the fact that it's needed to meet the load requirements of the problem of -- the province, sorry, and our ability to repurpose and reposition our coal-fired fleet to a gas-fired fleet to be even more competitive than it presently is at a capital cost that's a fraction of new built. In terms of structure, it may have taken us a while to get here, but we now have certainty of market design with the government of Alberta's retention of the energy-only construct. And we're happy with the retention of the structure, which is pretty unique.</p><p>Compared with most power markets, the Alberta market is relatively pure, with relatively light regulatory interventions. Our experience with the market is that outcomes are dependent on demand and supply, with both operating costs and over time, a return of and on capital being bid into and being embedded in market prices. We expect this to continue and expect the regulatory construct to permit that to be the case in order to ensure that reliability is maintained in the province. Being a low marginal cost generator is critical today and will continue to be critical in the future to competitiveness generally, which is something that we're very much focused on. Our fleet is very well positioned to compete in the market with its blend of 0 cost wind in hydro, which as Dawn showed you in one of her earlier slides are really one of the largest fleets of those types in the province and with competitive and essential thermal generation, which is shifting to low-cost gas.</p><p>We also expect that Alberta will continue with a constructive carbon pricing framework, broadly along the lines of what we currently have with approximately a $30 per CO2 tonne price and credits for our existing wind and hydro generation in the province. You'll see today that these changes broadly support our strategy for our Alberta business, which emphasizes coal to gas investments and the development of boiler conversions and gas repowered combined cycle facilities.</p><p>Over time, we've had supportive and we believe appropriate pricing in Alberta with the average price in that $57 per megawatt hour range over the past 18 years. And that would be a little bit higher, probably closer to the $60 range if you take away 2016 and 2017. Those were unusual years due to the role that the Balancing Pool played in the termination of the historic power purchase arrangements and with the short run marginal cost bidding that it was doing during that time period, which is atypical in terms of what we've seen over time. Year-to-date, the price has been just over $57 per megawatt hour and the balance of the forward price is just a bit over $60 a megawatt hour. You can also see that the forward curves for 2020 and 2021 are suggesting prices in the $56 to $59 per megawatt hour range, respectively.</p><p>The slide also shows EDC Associates forecast for the province. EDC is based in Alberta, understands the market well and is generally considered to be the leading independent forecaster in the jurisdiction. Its forecast also suggests supportive prices, being well into the $60 to $80 range, providing strong margins for our Alberta base generating fleet and supporting our planned investments in our thermal fleet. Brett and Wayne are going to be talking further about this shortly.</p><p>Underpinning the price forecast has been the historic and expected ongoing load growth in the province, which is averaged about 1.5% per year since 2009, and which is being forecasted to grow by up to 1,700 megawatts by 2025. Load growth last year, and I'm talking about growth peak-over-peak, was approximately 3.3%, and we had a further 0.4% growth quarter-over-quarter in the first quarter of this year, notwithstanding the relatively weak overall economic picture for Alberta. This too is lending support to power prices in the province and shows that a level of incremental supply additions should be able to be absorbed by the market. As the largest incumbent player in the province with the most diversified generating fleet, this is again supportive of our gas conversion and repowering strategy. Although, as you'll see throughout our presentation, our strategy isn't really focused on load growth and doesn't require prices that are significantly higher than the levels that we're accustomed to seeing in the marketplace.</p><p>Our coal to gas repowering and conversion strategy is very much oriented towards replacing megawatts that we currently have in the market, extending the life of our facilities and reducing our operating costs even further. And on that last point, we remain driven by our desire to reduce our per megawatt hour cost of generation. And the 2 largest input costs for that are really carbon emissions and fuel. Brett will be speaking about the CO2 emissions, reductions that we're focused on. And the impact that carbon price has on that and the carbon price savings that we're targeting. But as you can see in the slide here, there is a very large supply of natural gas in Alberta, which has resulted in an associated reduction in the price of gas over the last 15 years or so. That too is also highly supportive of our gas focus strategy and will help us be an even lower cost generator in the province.</p><p>And this is really highlighted in the next slide, where we're showing you what our expected marginal fuel costs and carbon cost will be over time. And this will be critical in the energy-only market, which we'll be very much focused on marginal cost in order to be competitive. The blue bar on the left indicates our fleet wide weighted average price of generation based on the current composition of our fleet, including our wind and hydro assets. As we convert our coal fleet to gas and introduce 2 gas repowered units, we expect our weighted average marginal cost per megawatt hour to fall by about 35% pretty dramatically to approximately $15 per megawatt hour, which will clearly support our competitiveness in the province.</p><p>The other point that I'd like you all to takeaway today is that our generating fleet is needed in the province, and is absolutely critical to the provinces load being met with the required level of reliability. Using the Alberta Electric System Operator's own long-range adequacy metrics, the slide shows the ongoing importance of existing coal and eventually gas-fired supply in meeting the needs of Alberta. The chart on the left is a little busy, but shows in the blue line the peak demand expected by the ISO over the next 2 years. If you remove the dark green, and I think on one of the slides it -- well, I guess it is pink, I thought it was looking a bit brown yesterday, at the top of the chart, which represent the capacity available from intermittent wind generation in the intertie, the importance of existing installed coal, gas and hydro in meeting the needs of the province is pretty clear. The chart on the right, which is also based on the ISO's long-term adequacy metrics, points out that there are currently very real expectations of tight supply periods in the province, in the near term. The supply cushion represented shows the difference between firm supply, and by firm we exclude intermittent or uncertain wind in the intertie supply, and expected daily peak demand over the course of the next few years. And it highlights the potential for supply deficits for extended periods of time during the forecasted period.</p><p>In fact the chart, and it's probably a bit hard to see it, actually shows that the supply cushion is actually negative for extended periods of time, which are the lower dips that you see there, when only the most reliable generation available in the province is considered from a supply perspective. The key take away, I think, is that our Keephills and Sundance units are required to meet the needs of the province, which, as you all know is characterized by a very high and consistent industrial load level with a relatively limited fluctuation, that's 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. In fact, when we've canvased the variety of jurisdictions in the world, we haven't been able to identify another market that is as dependent on or as from a demand perspective as focused or comprised of industrial and commercial load as Alberta is. Our retail market is actually relatively small given our relatively small population base in the province.</p><p>I also want to highlight the importance of ancillary services in the context of our fleet. Ancillary services ensure that the interconnect electric system in the province is operated in a manner that gives a satisfactory level of service, with acceptable levels of voltage and frequency. Significant volumes of ancillary services are procured each year by the ISO, and we supply almost 50% of this important segment through our hydro fleet, and we do it in a manner that permits us to conserve and manage our water position throughout the year. And, we're able to achieve pretty good pricing, about 60% of the flat energy pricing in the province for that service that we provide. I'll be speaking a little bit more to you all about how our hydro fleet generates its cash flow, shortly.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to just have a quick word on the situation here on Ontario, where we have a pretty significant fleet, we're a significant generator, we actually have a bit over 1,000 megawatts of installed capacity in the jurisdiction. We are expecting the eventual implementation of a capacity market here, and at least some level of carbon pricing in the province based on the federal government's Output Based Pricing System. However, given the contracted nature of our assets in the jurisdiction, we're presently largely insulated from any near-term impacts from the changes that might occur in the market. Largely because of the current contracts as I mentioned and the change in law provisions that exist in them.</p><p>So moving on now to our operations. In terms of an operations overview, the key messages are that our generating fleet is highly diversified, both by fuel type and geography with considerable contractedness, upside from merchant generation, particularly in Alberta, and with an ongoing focus on low-cost generation. We've definitely seen an improvement in our fleet's financial and operating performance, encompassing a variety of key aspects from safety to availability, to the variable cost of production, all of which is something that we're really proud of. We've also unified our entire generating fleet under a single coordinated leadership team along with our trading, asset optimization, commercial team and our shared services group.</p><p>In terms of our operating model, we're really focused on being a leader in safe, low-cost generation with a focus on really 4 major elements. The first is simplification, and by simplification we mean leadership consolidation, a focus on reduced OM&amp;A, particularly as we continue our journey to converting our coal-fired generation to gas-fired generation, a focus on the development of a multi-skilled and flexible workforce, a focus on centralized and remote operations, which is really one of our core competencies, our wind and hydro fleets as well as much of our Australian gas business is all run in a remote and simplified manner. And finally, we have a key focus on the introduction of new acquisitions that we have in an efficient and simplified way.</p><p>Secondly, we've really concentrated on our fleet wide approach to asset optimization. Particularly with a focus on merchant portfolio in Alberta. And that includes a focus on fuel and carbon cost reductions, the use of data analytics to help us make better decisions in a more predictive way for the business. Those of you I think that were able to attend our Investor Day sessions this past July, would have seen firsthand some of the work that the team is doing by leveraging data analytics to make more informed and accurate, and frankly, faster decisions in operating and dispatching for our hydro and our wind assets. Third, we're also focused on the full implementation of our shared services model, which really isn't something we've spent a lot of time talking to you about and which I'm going to spend just a moment on. We're centralizing the provision of all common essential services for our generating business, under a senior -- under a single leadership and 1 that is coordinated with our generating fleet. And the kinds of services that we're focusing on are things like IT, supply chain, op services, such as compliance and engineering, and a number of the HR functions that we have. And as I mentioned, it'll be all 1 leadership team, no duplication and it'll be oriented towards just providing those services that the generating fleet requires.</p><p>And finally, we're going to continue to focus on the discipline that we've been able to develop by relentlessly focusing on our project Greenlight methodology. And the 2 key areas that we have for project Greenlight are really focusing on generating that bottom up innovation that our employees are developing, and by enhancing our organizational health, which in our mind is really trying to improve the way that we actually do things.</p><p>I can't even begin to stress the importance of this transformation at our company. And again, I think that those of you that were able to attend our investor tours in the summertime and spend time interacting with our employees would have gotten a firsthand feel for the impact that project Greenlight has had on the company. And the way that it's had an impact on the way that we do things, by empowering individuals to pursue any idea that they have to improve our business in a disciplined way. And I'll give you some examples of that as I talk specifically about our various operations.</p><p>So one of our greatest assets and strengths is the diversity of our fuel types, geography and cash flows. Our coal to gas and gas repowering assets in Alberta have provided us with a very attractive investment opportunity in a healthy market in which we have a leadership position, which -- and Wayne and Brett will be walking you through that shortly.</p><p>Our wind generation platform, which is amongst the largest in Canada and amongst the largest in North America, I think when you look at the size of the platform from a North American perspective, it's one of the top 15 platforms in the continent. It's a key part of our transition to becoming a leading clean power company. And it's in the process of seeing pretty significant growth with 4 projects under construction, which will increase the size of the fleet by about 30%. The strong contracted cash flows from our diversified gas fleet benefit our business, stabilize our cash flows, while we service the needs of our largely industrial customers. And finally, we have our unique set of irreplaceable hydro assets in Alberta, some of which continue to operate very, very well notwithstanding that they are over a 100 years old, and they continue to provide us with a unique competitive advantage in that jurisdiction, which is really difficult for anyone to replicate.</p><p>The positioning of our legacy coal assets has changed markedly in the last few years with a unique gas repowering opportunity that they represent. They represent approximately 20% of Alberta's generation. And we believe they will continue to provide much-needed, low-cost and reliable capacity for years to come. By the end of 2020, the PPA's governing the fleet will expire, which will finally result in full operating in dispatch control reverting back to TransAlta for the units. Our plant coal to gas repowering investment will dramatically extend the life of the assets, reduce their operating costs, and generate strong cash flows and excellent returns for our shareholders. And I'd like to just give you a sense on just a couple of the initiatives that we're working on from a project Greenlight perspective on the fleet. One of them is in our Centralia plant and facility's down in Washington state, where the team there has really been focused on the chemistry of coal blending and has managed through the work that they do to actually source cheaper supplies, but supplies of coal that they can blend properly to ensure that just a combustion and the fuel that we have in the unit operates as efficiently as it can be at the lowest possible cost that it can be, that's an ongoing piece of work that they do. And in Alberta, for example, at Alberta Thermal, we've been using artificial intelligence now to actually optimize as best as we can, the boilers that we have both in terms of the emissions that they have and the fuel that they generate, again, creating significant cost savings for the company and improving their reliability on a go forward basis.</p><p>Our hydro assets are unique, they're perpetual in nature and they provide a critical advantage for our company. We own and operate over 90% of the hydrogenation of Alberta, and we have additional hydro facilities in British Columbia and Ontario. As I mentioned to you earlier, they provide both ancillary services and energy to the market, and expect to receive green credits under Alberta's new carbon pricing scheme, which we believe will increase their value further. Most importantly, the hydro PPA that we have with the Balancing Pool in Alberta will expire at the end of 2020, which we expect will result in a significant increase in our cash flows from those facilities in 2021 and beyond.</p><p>And again, I just want to give you a project Greenlight example on our hydro fleet. Over the course of the last year or so the team has been really, really focused hard on developing a water forecasting and weather forecasting tool that they've been able to implement and some of the people would've seen that in the summertime. This has really improved our ability to actually forecast water forth flows and more precisely measure our reservoir levels, which we think conservatively has resulted on our cash flow improving by $3 million to $4 million this year alone, so that was a tremendous piece of work that the team did over the course of the last 12 months.</p><p>Our Alberta hydro assets are in a pricing premium, broadly in that 20% range as compared to the flat Alberta energy price. As a result of the manner in which we manage the facilities and their water supply, which is a pretty precious resource for us given that the system doesn't have a lot of storage, we run the facilities at times when prices are higher due to a tightness in the supply in the market. So taking 2018 as an example, while the average price in the market was in that $50 per megawatt hour range, we were able to secure an average price of $59 per megawatt hour for our wind fleet from the energy that we generated there. And as I mentioned earlier, our Alberta hydro assets also provide about 50% of the ancillary services requirements in the province, things like regulating reserves, spinning reserves, supplemental reserves and standby services. And they're paid about 60% of the flat market price in the province for those services, which often don't require us to flow any or significant water to actually earn them.</p><p>Sales of ancillary services roughly provide about half of the cash flow that we get from the fleet.</p><p>Now some of you may have seen this slide before. It provides a visual illustration of the EBITDA earned by our hydro fleet both prior to and following the impact of the power purchase arrangement that we have with the Balancing Pool, which, as I said, was going to expire at the end of next year. I am going to spend a little bit of time on this. And before getting into the numbers, I thought what I would do is just give you a brief overview of the mechanics of the arrangements so you can follow along.</p><p>Now our hydro fleet generates energy and ancillary services, which are sold at market prices, and our company has full operating and dispatching control over the fleet. And that weights very different than our PPAs over our coal fleet. However, the PPA, which impacts the bulk of our hydro fleet in Alberta, is settled separately and it's done in a financial manner, and there's really 3 major flows of cash that exist under that arrangement. The first one is that TransAlta receives an annual capacity payment from the Balancing Pool. And in return, we provide them with 2 payments. The first one is an annual energy payment that we give them, which is based on a notional quantity -- a prescribed notional quantity of annual energy generation. And the second one is an ancillary services payment, which we provide, which similarly is based on a prescribed notional quantity of ancillary services that we're -- that we generate.</p><p>So turning to the bridge, on the chart, which summarizes 2018 actual monetary flows for the hydro fleet, you'll see that we earned about $90 million from energy sales, a further $104 million from ancillary services sales in the year and we were paid $56 million from the Balancing Pool in terms of a PPA through the capacity payment that they provide, and that payment will disappear at the end of the PPA. But we expect that we're going to be able to make up a bunch of that lost cash flow through increased power prices and also through the carbon credits that we expect to receive for the fleet.</p><p>Finally, TransAlta earned another $41 million on its hydro fleet from the non-PPA hydro assets that we have. Our transmission, which is part of the segment that in the way that we reported. And also from other hydro services that we provide like water management services and black start capabilities. And that's a pretty stable cash flow year-over-year.</p><p>The cost of our hydro operations in 2018 was $47 million and when you deduct it from the revenue streams that are outlined on the chart, that I just went through, would give you Pro Forma EBITDA for the hydro business is roughly in that $240 million, $244 million range, which we believe is within the range of what we would normally expect the business to provide following the expiry of the PPA. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in the next slide. However, in 2018 under the terms of the PPA, we paid the Balancing Pool $135 million in the form of that annual energy and ancillary services payment that I was talking about earlier. And typically, that payment is equaled or broadly approximated 100% of the energy revenue that we've received and about 50% of the ancillary services revenue that the business would have received, and that would have led to the reported number, which was $109 million in the year. That payment, that $135 million payment will go at the end of the PPA, at the end of 2020.</p><p>In this chart, we presented a range of post PPA EBITDA outcomes from the hydro fleet after removing all of the impacts of the PPA, and over a range of Alberta flat prices ranging from $50 to $70. At these prices, we expect our hydro business to generate an EBITDA in the range of $200 million to about $250 million, which roughly translate to an EBITDA lift of about $18 million to $20 million for every $5 per megawatt hour increase in the price, is roughly what it translates to.</p><p>Turning to our wind and solar fleet, we have over 1,300 megawatts of capacity. Actually in 21 facilities, the additional facility's actually our solar in Massachusetts. And our wind is located in Alberta, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, New Brunswick, Wyoming and Minnesota, and we're currently developing 4 projects again in a diverse set of locations, which will increase the size of the fleet by almost 400 megawatts. The fleet is highly contracted, with an average capacity weighted contract life of about 11 years, and it provides us with predictable and growing cash flow of around $250 million a year. With the largest wind generator in Canada and have one of the largest platforms in North America, we have extensive in-house experience in wind farm development, which Aron is going to be speaking to you about a bit later, and we have a very strong operating model in our wind operations, highly developed remote operations and monitoring very experienced maintenance program and team and significant data analytics and optimization capabilities. And our wind fleet too is really focused on Greenlight initiative and examples, and these typically come from our employees. One of them that we've been working on is we've developed a new weather forecasting model, which helps us in the way that we operate the wind farms during the winter time, avoiding icing on the blades, and we think that, that's going to result in about $1 million, $1.5 million a year just to give you a sense of benefit there. The other thing that we've been doing is we've been working pretty hard with a team from Stanford University over the course of the last year, to deal with wake effects and yaw at the farms, and we think that the work that we've done there and the analysis that they helped us with, is going to increase the output of our wind farms from between 1% to 1.5%, so really excited about the collaboration that we've been doing with them.</p><p>Turning to our natural gas fleet. We've got about 1,300 megawatts of natural gas in the generating fleet, it's located in Alberta, Ontario and Western Australia, where we are focused on meeting the needs of a diverse set of industrial, commercial and utility customers. This portfolio of assets is highly contracted with an average capacity weighted contract life of about 7 years and provides us with a stable set of earnings for our company and largely based on the capacity payments that we have under those arrangements with very little variability. You'll hear from Aron later in the presentation that we're now seeing a renewed interest in on-site generation, which we think is going to add to the size of the generating fleet that we have once our growth team begins working on and ramps up there, so we're excited about that. Our gas team also spends a lot of time working on project Greenlight initiatives and I'll just give you 1 example or a couple of examples actually. In Australia, we're really focused on centralizing all of our remote operations, we've done it for the southern part of our generation in Western Australia, we're going to be folding in, our South Hedland plant into that and expect that the reduction in labor costs by doing that are going to be roughly in that $1 million to $1.5 million a year. And again, that was initiative that was developed by our employees. Another example is the work that we've done with our gas turbines at Sarnia where one of our engineers took it upon himself to see if he could reduce the load point effectively and where the -- how fast the generator effectively is running with a view -- while meeting all of the needs that we have for the facility in terms of heat and steam, but also at the same time, making sure that we stay within the envelope that we have for emissions, all the while lowering our fuel consumption because we're just burning less gas to see it through. And that's a significant initiative that will see us saving about $3 million maybe a little bit more million dollars a year in that facility, so another great example of the way our employees through our project Greenlight are thinking about helping our business.</p><p>Just want to touch on re-contracting. We believe we've been very successful in securing extension for our gas-fired facilities, we've got over 65 years of incremental contract life that we've been able to achieve as indicated on the slide. One of our key focuses right now is on re-contracting, as I was just talking about Sarnia, that 500-megawatt Sarnia Regional Cogen Plant, which -- its contract expiry is coming up in the 2022 to 2025 period, with some of the customers that we have there and with the contract we have with the AESO. We're actively engaged in discussions with the government of Ontario, the AESO and our existing customers, but also prospective customers to see if we can get extensions there and even new contracts to extend the cash flows -- the contracted cash flows of that facility. And overall, I think it's important to note our company is pretty highly contracted. With a weighted average contract life excluding our coal-fired generation of approximately 11 years and upon the expiry of the PPAs at the end of 2020 -- the thermal PPAs at the end of 2020, the majority of the -- our EBITDA will still remain tied to contracted assets. And the uncontracted portion of the fleet will be located primarily in Alberta, where we think we're going to be able to realize the upside that we expect to get in our hydro cash flows and the benefit of the expectation of some of the higher prices that we expect to see in the province.</p><p>Finally, I'd like to just touch on our trading and marketing team, which is very, very important to the company and our operations. And generally, it fulfills 4 basic functions -- 4 major functions. First, there is measured proprietary trading for profit that we do in each of the markets in which we operate and even some that we don't. And part of the benefit from that activity is just information flow in price discovery that we have for the company as a whole, which really helps a number of the business units in the company. The second element that we have in our trading group, it's just market intelligence and forecasting, which is used throughout our business both from a planning perspective and with Aron and Brett's growth teams. The third element is asset optimization and the hedging of our entire fleet, the merchant component of our business. And finally, we have a pretty robust C&amp;I business, where we try to develop solutions for commercial and industrial customers, again, primarily in Alberta, some of those contracts are longer life contracts, some as large as 5 years in length. And we tend to think of that as another way to -- really 2 things, another way to actually hedge our merchant exposure in the province, but also it's actually been a source of leads essentially for our growth team as we stay close to the customers and they identify opportunities that we have to serve them better.</p><p>Thanks very much. I'm going to now turn it over to Wayne to talk about the coal to gas convergence.</p><p>WAYNE ALEXANDER COLLINS, EXECUTIVE VICE-PRESIDENT OF GENERATION, TRANSALTA CORPORATION: Well, thank you, John, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Wayne Collins and I'm Executive Vice President of Generation here at TransAlta.</p><p>So we've been talking about our plans to convert our coal-fired units to gas for a number of years now. And so I'm really pleased to be staying here today to tell you that this process is well and truly underway. And our Alberta coal fired -- our plants are now all capable of consistently being able to regularly produce more than 30% of their energy from gas co-firing. There are significant benefits from converting our plants to 100% natural gas co-firing and based on our co-firing experience, we're already seeing those benefits through lower combined fuel and GHG compliance costs and lower OM&amp;A cost. As we complete the full conversion of our fleet, these improvements will increase further in an environment where gas costs are expected to remain very competitive in Alberta and were subject to carbon emissions levy or tax, conversion of all of their units to burn a 100% gas continues to make a really strong economic sense. So we've now completed all of the preliminary work that's necessary to allow us to firm up exactly the type of conversions that we want to undertake, and also the conversions schedule and I'll have a little more on this shortly. Because of the work we've done, we're very confident that the investments that we've made and made to date in which we will make to convert the Alberta coal plants to burn the 100% gas over the next few years will deliver very strong cash -- future cash flows and very attractive investment returns.</p><p>We're also confident, and Brett will show you in his section of the presentation that the Alberta portfolio of converted gas power plants that we're creating will be very competitive under the anticipated future market conditions.</p><p>So turning now to our specific gas conversion plans. The base plan involves 3 boiler conversions in the period of 2020 to 2021, in that period we will convert Sundance 6, Keephills 2 and Keephills 3, and 2 repowered combined cycle conversions, which will be Sundance 5 and Keephills 1 and that'll be straddled approximately a year apart. Keephills 1 and Sundance 5, the 2 future repowered combined cycle plans will either co-fire until they're repaired or potentially be converted to a 100% gas boiler conversion before then because as Brett will show you the carbon savings are significant and the payback times are relatively quick.</p><p>The options for Sundance 3 and 4 will be evaluated over the next year to 18 months. And as we're obligated to do, we'll continue to look at those plants in light of the future the long-term market fundamentals. The plan that we're presenting here today assumes also that there are no delays in getting the approvals -- the regulatory approvals we need, particularly for the repowered combined cycle plants and in securing the additional gas requirements that we need.</p><p>On this slide here, we're looking to really show you that boiler gas conversion is technically a fairly straightforward process. We're essentially replacing the coal burners with gas burners and a new set of gas fuel controls, there's also some changes we'll do to the way the air gets into the boiler, but -- and the planned outage that is required to do this and implement this conversion is relatively quick, it's approximately 6 weeks in duration. And as you can see from this slide, boiler gas conversion results in a materially simpler production process. It takes away the need for substantial items of plant, and in particular, eliminates the need for the mine. In addition to that, the coal handling plants are no longer required, coal mills, burners, pulverized fuel piping, a lot of wearing parts, ash handling equipment, air quality control systems, so whole areas of plant by precipitators and bag filters are no longer required.</p><p>So moving on to the repowered combined cycle plant, and on this slide, we illustrate what a repowered combined cycle plant entails. The repowered combined cycle process involves the installation of a new gas turbine and generator and that generator will be connected to the grid and transmit its power through a new grid connection. We'll use the exhaust gas from the gas turbine and pass it through a heat recovery steam generator to produce steam and that steam will then be connected into the existing steam turbine and the condensing feeding equipment, and the existing steam turbine and generator and the existing grid connection will be used to transmit that power to the network.</p><p>So the repowered combined cycle plant uses a mix of new and existing equipment to produce a plant that has heat rates, that are very comparable to those of a brand-new combined cycle gas turbine, however, as it uses a lot of our existing equipment, the capital cost is much, much lower, it's 40% to 50% lower than that of a new Greenfield combined cycle gas turbine.</p><p>Now, these repowered combined cycle plants are not a novel concept. There's something that's quite well proven. We are aware of, at least, 8 of these that have been completed in the U.S. And a number of conversions are also currently in progress. Our team have visited some sites, with lots of operating history. And on this slide here, we're showing you the Xcel Energy site, which is located in Minneapolis. This plant had a conversion, a repowered combined cycle conversion completed in 2009, it's been running for the last 10 years very, very reliably at high capacity factors.</p><p>Now the timeline for this conversion, it's our intention to seek the regulatory approvals for the repowered combined cycle plants, the 2 of those at the same time. We've got a parallel construction plan in mind with a slide offset in there, which will allow for the site construction team on Sun 5 repairing to finish their job and the bulk of those people to be able to move on to keep those unit one, once the Sun 5 is completed. The commercial operation date for Sun 5 repairing is the end of 2023. And for Keephills 1, it's the end of 2024.</p><p>Now moving to what this program at work will cost. The gas conversion outages have been scheduled to align with the normal turnaround maintenance outages for our plants. And it's our intention to complete kind of turnaround works scope and the gas conversion work in parallel. So -- and on this slide we're really showing you the total capital that we expect to spend on all of the activities that the Alberta coal plants during the period they're being converted to gas between 2020 and 2024. The total capital expenditure expected for the 2 repowered combined cycle conversion plant is our base case and that's approximately $1.5 billion, and that includes the boiler gas conversion capital, the sustaining capital that we have to spend on turnarounds, a life extension for that period, 2020 to 2024.</p><p>It should be noted that the repowered combined cycle gas conversions are a relatively higher cost compared to the boiler gas conversions. However, the repowered plants have 40% to 50% lower capital cost, and they're very competitive with the Greenfield gas -- Greenfield combined cycle gas turbine heat rates as I indicated earlier.</p><p>Now we haven't been sitting idle, there is a substantial body of work that's complete or well under way, and I'm just going to walk through some of that now.</p><p>So we have received the regulatory approval that we need for the boiler gas conversions, which have already been scheduled. The Pioneer Pipeline, as Dawn mentioned in her opening remarks, was completed last night, about 4 months ahead of schedule. And we have been taking gas from that pipeline since then. We have an EPC contract selected for the Sundance and Keephills boiler gas conversions. We've issued the full notice to proceed for the boiler conversion at Sundance 6. We've issued a limited notice to proceed for Keephills unit 2 boiler gas conversion. And Keephills 3 is a slightly different technically in the boiler, so we have a separate -- we've been out to the market with a separate request for proposal for all the boiler gas conversion on K3. We're currently evaluating that and we expect to make a decision on that later this year or early next year. We also have an Owner's engineer on Board to assist us with the work we need to do on the combined cycle repowering for Sun 5 and Keephills 1. And we've also entered into a carbon cost benefit sharing agreement with the Balancing Pool in Alberta for Keephills 1 and 2, and that will actually allow us to co-fire fairly heavily on those 2 units and share the benefits between now and when the PPA is finished at the end of 2020. Discussions are also underway for additional pipeline and gas supply capacity to improve reliability and Brett will touch on that a bit more later on.</p><p>So you can see that overall we are well into implementation here.</p><p>Also as I indicated in my opening remarks, we believe that there is substantial benefits from conversion to gas. Firstly, it provides attractive investment returns, and Brett will give you some more insights into that, significantly extends the life of our fleet, and I've got some more detail on that later on. It also substantially lowers our operating, our capital and our GHG compliance cost. And natural gas is in abundant supply and very competitively priced. And you also need to understand that natural gas conversion or gas conversion avoids the need for us to engage in significant expenditures on emissions, reductions, SOx and NOx emission reductions, which would be required if these plants stayed on coal. Boiler gas conversions have very low capital and we're very quick to do those conversions in the order of 6-week outage to do that. The repowered combined cycle plants, 40% to 50% lower capital cost in the Greenfield combined cycle plants. And so on the next few slides, we'll take you through some more detail on some of these benefits.</p><p>So let's now look at the life extension that this plant delivers. So the dotted line on this slide shows you that the TransAlta coal fleet would all be closed down by 2029, and if we did not undertake these conversions, and in fact, some of those closures would've commenced in the mid-2020s. The boiler gas conversions extend the plants life well into the mid to late 2030s. And the combined cycle -- the repowered combined cycle conversions extend those plant lives into the late 2040s. And further, it's also possible that we could undertake combine -- repowered combined cycle gas conversions on previously boiler converted units. So for example, a plant like K3 would be an ideal candidate for that.</p><p>As shown on the earlier slides, the converted gas plants are technically and substantially simple plants than coal-fired plants. There is a huge reduction in the volume of equipment in service, and that allows for the elimination of the need for a lot of routine operation and maintenance on all of that equipment. Co-firing and gas conversion also allow for significant reduction in the materials that we consume such as, chemicals and lime and activated carbon, bag replacements on bag filters. And the reduction in equipment in service and the work associated with the operation and maintenance on that equipment supports significant reductions in the operations and maintenance work force. It should be noted that the plant changes that we've already implemented and co-firing with gas has allowed this workforce transition to commence, it actually commenced in 2018. And you're already seeing the benefits of the lower OM&amp;A cost in 2018 and also in 2019. And so really in terms of our workforce transition, we are really on the journey to being fully converted to gas and our workforce transition is probably more than 50% completed already.</p><p>This slide -- this next slide shows you the substantial change in sustaining capital spend that we expect once all of the plants are converted to gas. So the light blue section of this slide of the first bar on this chart is showing you what our kind of average mining capital cost run rate -- sustaining capital run rate on the mine has been, it's in that $30 million to $40 million per annum. Post gas conversion, the mine moves into the reclamation mode and this capital spend is largely eliminated. And because of the reduction in the amount of equipment that's in service that I've talked about a couple of times earlier, the need for capital replacement on all of those elements that are no longer operating is eliminated as well.</p><p>And finally, the gas combustion is kind of much kinder to our plants, which results in a lot less tube wastage and erosion in our boilers. And so there will be less tube repair and shielding and those sorts of capital costs associated with those plants. So all out, you can see from this slide, we expect to see a fairly substantial 40%, 50% kind of run rate reduction that'll be used where it will go up and down a little bit post conversion.</p><p>So in summary, the plan we've laid out today and confirmed today will see us complete a minimum of 3 boiler gas conversions by the end of 2021. And 2 repowered combined cycle gas conversions by the end of 2024. That will considerably simplify our plant operations with significant reductions in OpEx, CapEx, GHG compliance cost moving forward. And it will substantially extend the life of our existing coal plants. These plants will be very, very competitive in the Alberta market.</p><p>And I'm now going to pass you over to Brett Gellner. And Brett's going to take you through some more detail on the economics and underpin the plan and the portfolio that we're looking to create here.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER, CHIEF DEVELOPMENT OFFICER, TRANSALTA CORPORATION: Okay. Thanks, Wayne, good morning, everyone. It's great to see you. So as Wayne -- I'm going to build off what Wayne just talked about and I'm going to walk you through some of the financial analysis behind our conversion plans and what this will show is that the fleet will be a very well-positioned for an energy-only market going forward. Then I'm going to walk you through the expected EBITDA impact for the Alberta Thermal fleet under different energy prices, once we're fully converted to gas and then I'll conclude my section with an update on our natural gas strategy.</p><p>So as Dawn indicated, our conversion plants are designed for the energy-only market by really striking a balance between having low marginal cost units and the amount of capital reinvested in Alberta that can be funded with our near- to medium-term sources of capital, and Todd's going to take you through that in more detail later. Originally, our initial plans when the capacity market was going to go ahead, we were thinking about repowering 1 of the units into combined cycle and the rest through the boiler conversions. Now with the retention of the energy-only market, we've pivoted those plans to look at repowering 2 units into combined cycle as they will have very low operating costs in that market.</p><p>So now what I'm going to do is walk you through the competitiveness of our plan, both from a marginal cost perspective and from a capital cost perspective. So first just turning to marginal cost, this chart compares a coal unit, a boiler converted unit and a repowered unit, under different natural gas prices. So you can see that the repowered unit is the most competitive because of its low heat rate, and virtually no to very low carbon cost going forward. The boiler conversions are also very competitive, especially when gases at $2.50 a GJ or lower. And as John showed earlier, the forward curve going out to 2020 currently is actually below $2 a GJ, so these are very competitive, even as boiler converted units.</p><p>So our conversion plants are very competitive from a capital cost perspective as well. So you can see from this chart, the capital cost per KW of capacity for a boiler converted unit is very, very low, and I'm going to walk you through on the next slide, this capital can be paid for in under 1.5 years based solely on the carbon and other omission savings we'll get from converting from coal to gas. The cost for the repowered combined cycle is also very attractive when you compare it to a Greenfield brand-new combined cycle or even a brand-new Greenfield Cogen as we have seen some announcements. And this is due to, as Wayne said, we're going to be able to use the existing steam turbine and other infrastructure that's already on site. So as a result of these competitive, marginal and capital costs, our investments in converting the gas will generate very strong returns even under a low-energy price scenario.</p><p>So let me now take you through the omission savings and that what this shows is the omission savings being 100% on coal units and then boiler converted unit. The top chart shows the savings on a per megawatt-hour basis. The total reduction is in around $18 a megawatt hour. Most of this is due to carbon, but we also eliminate mercury and we avoid any operating costs to meet NOx and SOx going forward. The bottom chart then converts these savings per megawatt over into total annual savings. As you can see it ranges from $25 million to $50 million per year for a 400 megawatt unit, and that depends on the capacity factors that the unit runs at. So given a capital cost to converted unit in around the $30 million to $35 million, you can see that the emission savings alone results in a payback of 1.5 years or less, resulting in these being very low-risk investments. Furthermore, this analysis does not factor in the avoidance of about $40 million of capital we would have to spend per unit to meet the NOx and SOx if we stayed on coal, nor does it factor in the lower future OM&amp;A sustaining and mining costs that Wayne just walked you through. So what I'm going to do now is take you through the investment metrics of the repowered combined cycle units.</p><p>So you can see on this chart, depending on energy prices, the investment cost multiples, which as you know is akin to an enterprise value to EBITDA multiple ranges from only 2.6x to 7.3x, so very attractive and well below what a new Greenfield project would deliver because of the higher cost to build the Greenfield. So you can see as a result, the repowered units will generate very solid returns and cash flows even under low energy prices.</p><p>So this slide now brings it all together to show what the EBITDA generated under different energy prices from the Alberta fleet will look like once it is fully converted to gas. The chart on the left has the fleet with 1 repowered combined cycle and the chart on the right has 2 repowered combined cycles. So you can see the EBITDAs are very strong under all of the energy prices shown here, and under our 2 repowering is significantly higher than a 1 repowering clearly because of the lower cost structure. Just to give you a sense, roughly, every $5 change in energy price equates to about a $75 million to $85 million change in EBITDA.</p><p>So it also is a reference point, we show here what we expect our 2019 EBITDA to be. John showed earlier, we expect energy prices to come in just under $60 for this year. So if you pick the $60 point on this chart, you can see if prices are at that are and we're fully converted, we're actually going to generate significantly more from this fleet than we do today. It's also important to remember, converted, these EBITDAs are going to go much longer because the coal fleet as Wayne pointed out has to start to retire at the end of 2026 and completely retire by the end of 2029. Plus as Wayne pointed out, the maintenance cost going forward will be quite a bit lower with the converted fleet than it will be with a coal fleet.</p><p>So now what I want to do is turn to our gas supply. As you know, we invested 50% in Pioneer Pipeline. As both Dawn and Wayne mentioned, this came on 4 months ahead of schedule. It's allowed us to increase our co-firing, which has resulted in lower carbon and fuel costs for those units. Starting November, our firm commitment of 139 TJs per day starts, and therefore, at that time we'll start significantly increasing the amount of co-firing we do ahead of even the boiler conversions that we'll start later next year. In terms of our long-term gas requirements, once we're fully converted, we expect to consume on average approximately 350 to 400 terajoules a day. Now there will be certain hours and days where it's higher than this or lower than this but on average, this is roughly what we expect. So in addition to the commitments we have with Tidewater, including the fact that that pipe can handle up to 440 terajoules and the commitments we have currently with the NOVA -- of the NOVA system. We're in active discussions with other third parties for securing additional gas supplies for the Pioneer line as well as potentially adding additional pipeline capacity into the sites. And we'll keep you posted on these developments once they are finalized.</p><p>So as you can see, our strategy to convert to gas is full steam ahead. As Wayne pointed out, the strategy involves converting 2 of the units to combined cycle. We are timing these about a year apart, and really, this allows us to -- gives us the flexibility to modify some of our plans if market fundamentals do not fully support the investments, but it's also to help optimize the construction of the 2 units. So by executing these conversion plans, not only will this fleet become even more competitive source of electricity in Alberta, but it will also generate solid cash flows, even under conservative energy prices and generate attractive returns for shareholders. So with that, I think we're going to take a break and then afterwards, Aron's going to kick us off with going through our growth strategy for on-site generation and renewable energy.</p><p>CHIARA VALENTINI: And tell them that we will be back.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Oh, 15 minutes, is that the game? 15 minutes.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>ARON JOHN WILLIS, SENIOR VICE-PRESIDENT OF GROWTH, TRANSALTA CORPORATION: Okay. Good morning, everyone. The doors at the back of the room are closed, so that's my cue to start. Aron Willis is my name, and I lead TransAlta's growth team and just wanted to say welcome back. I'm going to speak with you this morning about our growth strategy and program, and I hope that through my part of the discussion, you'll get a good understanding about how we're thinking about growing our company, not just growing in terms of adding megawatts, but in terms of how we're targeting projects where we can add some value to ensure the addition of strong, contracted cash flows to the bottom line.</p><p>From my discussion, I want you to take away the fact that we're very focused in our growth ambitions and that we're already having success in the markets that we've targeted. We know what our competitive strengths are and we're leveraging those strengths to add contracted cash flows to the company. I'm also going to touch briefly on each of the growth projects that we currently have underway as it's a list that demonstrates the progress that we're making in these targeted markets already.</p><p>Our team's been doing some great work, developing a strong pipeline of projects, and we're building on an impressive track record of successful growth that goes back decades. That's what makes me confident that we're going to hit our targets here, and I hope that you'll share that view with me when I'm finished today.</p><p>So I want to start with where we're placing our focus, and it's really 2 areas or 2 key segments of the market. First, the on-site and cogeneration business; and second, the corporate contracted renewables market, which, today, is primarily wind and it's primarily in the United States.</p><p>We have 900 megawatts of on-site and cogeneration opportunities in our pipeline today. These projects are on industrial sites, such as natural gas processing facilities, petrochemical plants, mining operations and oil sands operations. Our experience in this space actually goes back to the 1990s, and in fact, many of those plants and relationships that we developed in the '90s are still very much an active part of our operating fleet today. There's no doubt that this market is growing again. We're seeing a real resurgence in demand here, driven by a few things, customers wanting to gain more control over their energy costs, replacing aging or inefficient boiler equipment, reducing their exposure to network cost and lowering their carbon footprint. On-site generation delivers benefits in each one of these areas.</p><p>Additionally, the improvement that we've seen in both cost and efficiency of smaller-scale gas turbine and reciprocating engine technologies now allows us to bring this technology to customer sites that were previously too small for the economics to make sense.</p><p>On the renewable side, we continue to see the corporate PPA market setting records year-over-year with very few signs of slowing down. Importantly, this market's also diversifying from what once was the domain of the big tech and telecom giants to now being a very broad spectrum of buyers across almost all industry sectors. Many of these buyers are also now driving their sustainability objectives down through their supply chains, which is further increasing demand and also increasing demand or creating demand in other markets around the world.</p><p>Our focus initially here is on the U.S. as that's the most active market today, and we currently have about 2,000 megawatts of projects and development sites that we have under evaluation today.</p><p>You'll also notice that both of these growth-focused areas are customer based. Now for me when I think about value-adding growth for the company, this aspect is absolutely key. Deals with customers create benefit in terms of the economics of the specific deal itself, but they also create the opportunity to do more. Many of these customers have multiple sites or very significant ESG objectives that they are trying to satisfy, and getting into business with them and delivering on our commitments puts us in a really strong position to do more with these same customers. This is particularly true in the on-site and cogeneration market.</p><p>Now with those target markets clear, I actually want to take a minute just to look back and show you what our historical performance looks like from a growth perspective. Our growth track record since 1990 actually spans 5 countries and includes gas, wind, solar, coal, geothermal and hydro assets. I like this slide because it demonstrates the number and size of projects that our team has developed over the last 30 years. You can also pretty clearly see a shift from gas in the earlier years to renewables from the mid 2000s onwards. The bubbles on this chart represent more than 30 projects, and across those 30 projects, I also want you to notice the relatively steady pace of growth.</p><p>While there's been a variety of project sizes that might swing 1 year's total megawatts up or down, the pace in terms of the number of projects has been relatively consistent. We haven't added a whole bunch of projects in 1 year and then gone quiet for a few years, rather that steady effort and being in the market consistently has allowed us to add assets at a very good pace. I've personally had the chance to be involved in many of our most recent projects, in addition to the gas assets that we developed in Australia since 2012. I'm always impressed with the capability of our team and the expertise that we have to do this work in-house.</p><p>Our team manages the entire process, front-end development, permitting engineering, site acquisition, resource assessment, contract negotiations and construction. On top of that, we have the capability to analyze and move quickly on attractive acquisition opportunities. This set of skills positions us very well to continue to build on this success that we've seen over the last 3 decades of growth. The skill sets also the foundation for how we've created some competitive advantages that we can build from.</p><p>I'm excited about these 2 growth focus areas, and I'm very confident that our team's going to build on our competitive advantages to deliver some excellent projects into the portfolio. I see us having some pretty strong advantages in these markets. First, in the on-site and cogeneration market, you must be able to operate safely and reliably. We've been doing that on customer sites for 30 years. Frankly, our operating teams makes this part of my role quite easily. They've got a track record that I'm proud to put in front of prospective customers when I go see them.</p><p>The next thing that I talk about with customers is how we can design a plant that will fit within their operating requirements and deliver against their objectives. I don't have a cookie-cutter plant design that I'm trying to sell, rather my team works to understand the customer site in detail, and then design something that's going to suit their operation and deliver against their objectives at the lowest possible cost. Once that's complete, our team can construct the plant and then hand it over to the operations team. So we really can provide a start to finish solution for these customers.</p><p>In the wind market, again, it's our track record and our experience that positions us as an expert in this space. We were an early mover in wind in the early 2000s, and we have one of the largest fleets in Canada and we've been operating these types of assets as long as anybody in the game in North America.</p><p>Again, we know the whole project life cycle here, from site prospecting and wind resource assessment through permitting, construction and operations. We maintain about half of our fleet through our own in-house team, and we operate the entire fleet through our remote operations and monitoring center in Pincher Creek.</p><p>Our team of experts today is operating on the Canada's oldest wind farms on the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in Qu\u00e9bec, and next year, we'll start construction at Windrise, utilizing the very latest technology and what will be the largest wind turbines in use in Canada.</p><p>Underpinning these areas of strength is our trading and marketing organization, a group that understands the regions and markets that we operate in deeply. Their expertise in energy and transmission markets allows us to deal with things like optimizing excess energy from projects, managing basis risk and dealing with any other aspect of how a plant needs to interact with the local market. Having this expertise in-house, allows us to manage these positions with a tremendous level of confidence and really deliver some significant value for customers in this way.</p><p>So I want to move for a couple of minutes to a few of the trends that we see driving these markets that we're focused on. First of all, notwithstanding the load growth in Alberta that John shared earlier, in many regions, we're actually seeing lower, even flat demand for electricity. Even as more of the things that the world relies on are increasingly being powered by electricity, our relentless focus on efficiency is driving many very successful conservation initiatives and putting downward pressure on demand.</p><p>At the same time though, power generation is transforming as the existing fleet ages and retires is being replaced by smaller, much more distributed technology, and there's no doubt that the drive to decarbonization is firmly underway, meaning a significant portion of fleet replacement will ultimately be through the addition of wind and solar assets. This same focus on efficiency is also driving a high level of direct procurement and an increasing desire by customers to actually choose their supply technology. This is creating a high volume of corporate renewable procurement that I'll talk about in a moment, and it's also opening opportunity on the on-site and cogeneration space as customers with the right type of facility see a significant benefit from a dedicated generation source at their facility. And we also see some very interesting processes to procure what we refer to as hyper generating plants, generally, these are facilities that include a portion of on-site baseload generation, supplemented by some renewables as well as some form of energy storage. This is actually becoming more common as customers want to have a hand in actually deciding the type of generating plant that's going to be based at their facility.</p><p>Now you may have seen this graph before or some version of it, it's a fairly highly used piece of data. It's so frequently used because it's telling a pretty incredible story. The graph shows the continued buildout of renewables in the United States that is directly contracted to corporate off-takers. 2019, again, is on track to be the largest year on record, both from a capacity contracted perspective as well as based on the number of new agreements. This graph is showing data up to 2018, but I can tell you that at the halfway point in 2019, there were already 43 new agreements signed accounting for about 4 gigawatts of capacity.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this market's diversifying significantly, and we see activity here now across almost all different industry sectors. It's not just a U.S. story either, it's important to note. Globally, there were over 8 gigawatts in PPA signed in the first half of 2019, which puts this year, again, on pace ahead of the 13.4 gigawatts of contracts signed for the full year in 2018.</p><p>Now in the U.S., we know that the upcoming end of the tax incentive program is motivating quite a high level of activity at the moment and through 2021. So it's quite likely that we'll see a peak of activity and then a bit of a lower run rate going forward, but it's clear that this market's being driven by much more than a tax incentive program. Corporate ESG objectives and commitments are going to continue to drive this market at what will be a pretty exciting pace.</p><p>Overall, these trends are creating opportunity. I see a tremendous market here for us to apply our experience and our expertise to, to develop some great projects for the TransAlta fleet. And we already are. In this corporate PPA market specifically, we have our Big Level and Antrim projects that are both contracted to corporate off-takers, Microsoft at Big Level and Partners HealthCare at Antrim.</p><p>Our competitive advantages really do set us up well to compete in these 2 markets, and I'm under no illusions about the level of competition. There are many others out there who are focused on these markets and who would like to take their fair share of their market here as well. But I'm confident that we'll succeed, particularly given that we've already had some great wins, so I want to show you a few of those now.</p><p>And this next slide is really critical for me, because I think it makes my job here at this morning quite a bit easier and that I don't have to try and convince you that we're going to maybe grow someday by talking about a big development pipeline. Instead, I can just show you what we're already doing and where we're already having success. This is our list of announced projects today between $750 million and $800 million of growth investment. The list is all wind and storage today, but soon I plan to have a cogeneration project add to this list. The list totals roughly 400 megawatts of new wind capacity, and as John mentioned earlier, this accounts for a 30% increase in the size of the operating wind fleet that we have today.</p><p>Now I want to briefly look at the specifics of each one of these projects. We have 3 wind projects under construction in the U.S. today, and 2 of them are nearing completion. The first is Big Level, a 90-megawatt wind farm in Pennsylvania with a 15-year offtake agreement with Microsoft, as I mentioned earlier. Obviously, we're very pleased to have added Microsoft as a customer, and this project will be online later this year. I can tell you that nearly all of the turbine components have been delivered and have been staged at each of the turbine locations. Today, over half of the wind turbine or action work has been completed, and this project's being funded directly by TransAlta Renewables as is the next project at Antrim.</p><p>Antrim, again, is directly contacted, there's actually 2 off-takers here, Partners HealthCare and New Hampshire Electric. The project is mechanically complete, so all 9 wind turbines are fully assembled and commissioning is well underway. This 29-megawatt project will be online in Q4 of this year, which will mark the start of its 20-year offtake agreement. And the third U.S. project's called Skookumchuck, which is located in Washington state, not too far from our Centralia facility. This project's under construction today, it's being built by Renewable Energy Systems, or RES, and we will purchase a 49% interest in the project at COD. Again, the wind farm has a 20-year offtake agreement, this time with Puget Sound Energy.</p><p>The other market where we'll soon have wind under construction is back at home in Alberta, where we have the Windrise and WindCharger projects with both having equipment orders placed and plant construction start date -- start date's next year.</p><p>WindCharger will be the first utility scale battery installation in Alberta and will be located at our existing Summerview 2 wind farm. The project is being supported by Emissions ReductionAlberta, and we're very excited to be a first mover in bringing large-scale battery storage to the province. We're working with Tesla on this project and together with them, we've completed the final design and placed an order that will see the battery delivered early next year. A relatively short construction time frame means we'll have the battery up and running by midyear.</p><p>And last but not least, Windrise, our large 207-megawatt project that we won through the Alberta government's Renewable Energy Procurement Program in late 2018. I have to tell you our team is really excited to be building wind again at home in the region where we started our wind business about 20 years ago, and not just any wind farm, for us, Windrise will be the largest wind farm in our fleet and it will utilize some of the biggest gas -- wind turbines used in Canada, the Siemens Gamesa 4.8-megawatt machines with a 90-meter hub height. Again, another project with a 20-year offtake agreement.</p><p>So that was a bit of whirlwind tour. I'd love to spend more time talking about these projects with you this morning, and I'm certainly happy to do that if you catch me a little later once the formal presentations have concluded. It's a great list of projects because they are a perfect fit within the strategic focus areas that I talked about, they're adding capacity to our fleet with a new suite of customers and in some cases, new partners and they're doing that while adding material EBITDA to the business.</p><p>You can see from this graph how the EBITDA from each of these projects phases in over time as each reaches completion. By 2022, this set of projects will be adding roughly $50 million in EBITDA to the fleet and that's just this list.</p><p>With our track record for adding growth firmly established and our team already having this kind of success in our defined focus areas, I'm confident that in the near future, we'll have more projects to tell you about that will further add to this result, and I'm really looking forward to adding the first co-gen project to this list, and with the progress that we're making in that space, I'm confident that I'll have a project to tell you about their in the not-too-distant future.</p><p>And with that, I thank you for your time and attention this morning, and I'll turn the podium over to our CFO, Todd Stack.</p><p>TODD JOHN STACK, CFO, TRANSALTA CORPORATION: Thanks, Aron, and good morning, everyone. Over the past several years, the company has made significant progress in improving its overall financial position, strengthening our balance sheet and managing cost pressures. In addition to operational improvements, we've executed a number of strategic financings to position us for the future. The result of these actions has been strong cash flows, generated by the business and an overall reduction in net debt, including a significant reduction in the amount of senior corporate bonds.</p><p>These actions put us in a very strong position to execute the repowering strategy that we've been discussing this morning without accessing the equity markets. This morning, I'm going to be walking through how we're now thinking about capital allocation and funding plans over the next 4 years. In addition to funding the repowering strategy, we're able to continue our growth in the renewables business and deliver on our plan of returning capital to shareholders through our announced share buyback program.</p><p>During this period, we also expect to further strengthen our balance sheet by repaying our 2020 bond maturity. As you know, TransAlta Corporation owns 61% of TransAlta Renewables. And as a result, RNW's financials are consolidated within those of TransAlta. This morning, I will show you TransAlta's balance sheet and cash flows on a deconsolidated basis, that is how it would look if TransAlta Renewables was not consolidated. This deconsolidated view of TransAlta and RNW is one of the ways that we look at our funding plans.</p><p>In 2013, we spun out a minority interest in TransAlta Renewables to highlight the value of our contracted renewable and gas assets. In addition to lower cost of capital -- sorry, in addition, the lower cost of capital at RNW improves our ability to compete for new renewables projects in Canada and the U.S. as Aron described earlier. However, we regularly get questions about the cash generated by the remaining portfolio of assets held at the TransAlta Corporation level. The assets under TAC are predominantly merchant or soon to be merchant and include the Alberta hydro assets, the coal-to-gas assets, Centralia, and our 50% of the TA co-gen assets, which include our share of the Sheerness facility and several other gas plants.</p><p>The waterfall chart on Slide 84 is based on 2018 reported results and shows the deconsolidation of cash flows. Beginning with the $770 million of consolidated funds from operations number, which is reported in our 2018 year-end MD&amp;A, we first deduct distributions paid to our 50% partner at TransAlta cogen. To deconsolidate RNW, we deduct 100% of the FFO reported by TransAlta Renewables, which for 2018 was $381 million. Remember that RNW's FFO is used to fund their sustaining capital, make payments on their amortizing debt and pay dividend to their shareholders who include both the public shareholders and TransAlta.</p><p>To include our share of the cash from RNW, we add back the $151 million of dividends paid to us. The resulting value of $454 million is our 2018 deconsolidated FFO. This cash is available to fund capital projects, retired debt and returning cash to shareholders at TransAlta. A more detailed description of this reconciliation is included in the forward-looking statements included on Slide 2 of the presentation.</p><p>So let me turn now to our capital allocation strategy. We start with deconsolidated FFO at the TransAlta level as the primary source of capital available for allocation. The breakdown at the bottom part of the page includes the uses that we consider in formulating our capital allocation plans with -- so with these uses, we've included percentages, which represent our expected range of the allocation over the next few years.</p><p>I'll start with the common dividend as this morning, we announced that the Board has approved a formal dividend policy to allocate 10% to 15% of deconsolidated FFO for dividends to common shareholders. While setting the dividends is a responsibility of the Board, we expect that they will be addressing the dividend amount early in 2020. So we're currently paying out about 10% to 12% of deconsolidated FFO to dividends, which is at the low end of our target range and provides the Board with some flexibility in the near term when assessing the dividend.</p><p>With respect to sustaining and productivity capital, our CapEx spend can vary -- can be very lumpy, depending on the timing of major outages. And because of that, we focus on our average expected spend over the long term. The percentage allocation shown here represents a long-term average and individual years may fall outside the range. In 2020 and 2021, we'll be taking major outages on at least 3 of our coal units to complete the gas repowering and to see these units -- and to set these units up to run into the 2030s. However, as Wayne mentioned earlier, over the long term, we expect the proportion of FFO allocated to CapEx to decline as the operations become simpler and less capital-intensive once the coal units have been converted or repowered.</p><p>This trend to lower CapEx will allow more capital to be directed to other priorities, including dividends. The largest portion of our allocation represents the cash that's left after funding CapEx, addressing debt amortization at TAC and paying preferred and common share dividends. This remaining cash is available to fund growth, debt reduction and share buybacks.</p><p>Over the past several years, a large portion of this cash at TransAlta has been focused on debt reduction. As you'll see in the next few slides, we're on track with our debt reduction plans and able to achieve targeted levels. This gives us the confidence to commit a significant portion of our capital to our boiler conversion and repowering projects over the next 4 years. The coal-to-gas conversions provide a unique opportunity in our home market, and we view these high-returning projects as a high priority in our capital allocation strategy.</p><p>Before I leave this slide, I just wanted to touch on our share buybacks. Earlier this year, we committed to repurchase up to $250 million of shares over the next 3 years. This repurchase program is being funded with a portion of the Brookfield investment arranged earlier in the year, and therefore, doesn't take away from other potential uses of FFO.</p><p>Next, I'll address the balance sheet progress I referred to earlier. As you can see from the chart, we've had considerable success over the past 5 years in repositioning the balance sheet. We expect to achieve our goal of reducing our senior bonds to the $1.2 billion level by the end of 2020. Cash on hand, free cash flow and other sources of liquidity are sufficient to repay our $400 million bond maturity in 2020 without accessing the capital markets.</p><p>We monitor a range of credit metrics to assess our financial position and our practice has been to disclose our targets and performance on a consolidated basis in order to align with rating agency treatment and presentation of our audited financials. However, internally, we also look at our credit metrics on a deconsolidated basis.</p><p>In this slide, we look at our debt-to-EBITDA level on a deconsolidated basis, both today and on a pro forma basis, after the PPA is expired, and we're able to realize the full revenue from the hydro assets. When we think about debt levels on a deconsolidated basis for TransAlta, we balance the predictability of our cash flows from our TransAlta Renewables dividend, the strong cash flows from our Hydro business against the relative volatility of our merchant assets. Based on the makeup of our EBITDA, we believe that a target debt-to-EBITDA metric of below 3x is appropriate.</p><p>One item to point out on this slide is the inclusion of the Brookfield investment in the buildup. Under accounting rules, the Brookfield investment will be treated -- will be considered as debt until it converts. Internally, our assessment is that the conversion is highly probable and we currently plan for it to convert post-2024. As you can see in the post PPA buildup, with the repayment of our 2020 bond next year and full revenues from the Hydro Assets in 2021, we're on track to meet our deconsolidated debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3x.</p><p>Let me turn now to our funding plans. As mentioned earlier, our base plan includes boiler conversions of 3 units in 2020 and 2021 and the repowering of 2 units as combined cycle plants scheduled to be in service in '23 and 2024. So if I continue to look at TAC on a deconsolidated basis, roughly 65% of our plan over the next 4 years is funded by internally generated cash flows, our dividends from RNW and cash on hand.</p><p>The second tranche of Brookfield investment is expected in 2020 and will provide an additional $400 million of funds. This will further support the funding of the conversion program and our share buyback program. This means that about 80% of our funding plan is known and not dependent on the capital markets. We are, however, expecting to access the debt markets in order to refinance our 2022 bond. This refinancing will keep our senior bonds at or below the $1.2 billion level. Our base capital program will result in a minimal draw on our credit facility over the next 4 years and is expected to be quickly repaid once the first repowered units come online.</p><p>One other point to highlight on these funding slides is that the deconsolidated growth capital does not include the Windrise or Skookumchuck projects. These wind projects have long-term contracts and are ideally suited for dropping down into TransAlta Renewables at some point in the future.</p><p>Let me turn now to our funding plan for TransAlta Renewables. Funding in RNW for the Big Level and Antrim projects is relatively straightforward. These projects are expected to be completed by the end of this year and have been funded with free cash flow, proceeds from the dividend reinvestment program at RNW and draws on RNW's credit facility. We expect to close the tax equity financing by the end of the year to repay the credit facility borrowings. Looking forward, I mentioned that the Windrise and Skookumchuck projects are good fits for dropping into the RNW portfolio. We expect to finance these assets with asset-level financing in the form of project debt at Windrise and tax equity at Skookumchuck. The relatively small and manageable equity portion of these projects will be funded using the balance sheet and repaid with operating cash flows and proceeds from the RNW DRIP program.</p><p>RNW has significant balance sheet capacity to finance its current build program in addition to these potential drop downs. In addition, RNW has access to additional sources of capital to fund incremental growth projects, including the potential to raise between $400 million and $600 million of project debt on currently unencumbered assets.</p><p>The final message I want to share with you today is views on the valuation of our shares. EV to EBITDA multiples are a common way to quickly compare and value assets in our industry. Starting on the left, the enterprise value of TransAlta can be calculated on our -- based on the market value of our shares. Similarly, we can value and back out the enterprise value for TransAlta Renewables based on their trading price. This leaves us with the implied value for the remaining TransAlta assets. Within these assets, one of the key assets is the Alberta Hydro facility, which we believe is valued at about $2.5 billion. When we subtract the Hydro value out, the EBITDA from the remaining assets, which includes the Alberta Thermal fleet is only being valued at about 3x. From our view, it's clear that the market is not recognizing the full value of the conversion plan. The incremental value could add $4 to $7 to the share price.</p><p>I'll now turn the podium over to Dawn for some final comments.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Thanks, Todd, and thanks, everyone. Really great set of presentations and I think a lot of detail that will really help you assess the value of the plan that we're putting forward here today.</p><p>Now I know that everyone's chomping at the bit to get their questions out, so I'm just going to quickly summarize what we want you to take away. So first, we believe we are at a very attractive entry point as a company in Canada who has a really great future ahead of us. We are ready to invest up to $2 billion in a clean energy plan that is exciting, it's competitive and it has strong returns. We are the company to invest in if you want to position in the Alberta market as it responds to carbon pricing and final changes to an energy-only power market.</p><p>We have created a plan that gives us longer term and sustainable competitive advantage in a market where we've been a cornerstone generator since 1911. We're also the company to invest in if you want to participate in the increasing electrification of energy and if you wanted, again, into the growing renewables and ESG space.</p><p>The plan is comprehensive, it's funded and it's very, very transparent. We are backing our confidence in our plan by continuing to buy our own stock as we believe it's a great entry point and our investments are strong enough to maintain a strong balance sheet and contemplate dividend increases along the path. There are definite advantages to running one company with one team, and you now have the information to see how the dividends from RNW benefit you as a TransAlta shareholder. So it's pretty exciting to be standing here today sharing all of this with you, and we are ready to take your questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: (Operator Instructions) So who would like to be first?</p><p>ANDREW M. KUSKE, MD, HEAD OF CANADIAN EQUITY RESEARCH, AND GLOBAL CO-ORDINATOR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH, CR\u00e9DIT SUISSE AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Andrew Kuske, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. I think one of the comments that was made earlier was your business plan isn't really dependent on pricing in the marketplace and you've laid out a pretty compelling cost-reduction story for yourselves and then some of the consultancy slides that you've showed actually had increasing pricing. What dynamics are driving the increase in pricing and some of the major incumbent players actually have decreasing cost profiles?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: John, do you want to take that?</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Sure. Is it working? Yes, can you hear? Okay. So in terms of increasing prices in the marketplace, I mean I think there's -- when we look at the prices, I think one of the key factors that has occurred in the market is the way it's actually been. It's a close market effectively. We've got 5 major competitors that compete very strongly against each other, they all have a mind to bidding not just their marginal cost, but also looking at getting a return of a noncapital in the market. I think that's a key factor. I think we are seeing some load growth in the market. I think there's also been some reductions in the number of supply in the market. I mean we've had a couple of units actually leave our Sundance 1 and 2 units are gone. I think we're looking at potentially Battle River 3 also leaving the market.</p><p>I think when you look at that, that's another 700, 750 megawatts, I think, of generation that's leaving. The market is very much an event-driven market. I think it's tight very often. You see sort of prices spike up, and the other thing I think that is notable in our market is we do have renewables, but I don't think we're expecting to see, given the nature of the marketplace, the kind of impact or penetration of renewables that you've seen in maybe some other markets, which act as a reduction on pricing. And I think as prices come down, in terms of some of the variable cost come down, I think the margins will continue to be pretty good, even though we might get some variability on pricing.</p><p>ANDREW M. KUSKE: Maybe just as a follow-up. Do you see a rise of peakers being introduced into the market in the future, just given the volatility and energy-only nature?</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: We may do. Right now, we don't see a significant kind of movement that way but it is possible given how some of the reductions in the cost of getting peakers in the technologies have come down, it is a possibility.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. Let me just add something on that. I think if you look at the simple boiler conversions, those are peakers, and their $30 million to $50 million to make a peaker compared to a couple of hundred million to make a brand-new peaker. So if I was looking at the market, I would be looking at the potential for the existing stock to create pretty good peakers at pretty good heat rates.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH, DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF THE US POWER, UTILITIES &amp; ALTERNATIVE ENERGY EQUITY RESEARCH, BOFAMERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Excellent. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Great follow-up actually on that. Can you comment a little bit more on the market dynamics, what are you seeing in terms of retirements, especially given your own considerations to convert your units out there? How do you think about sort of the pluses, minuses, load growth, retirements of coal potentially elsewhere, but then also on the other side of the ledger, if you will, how do you think about your peers because you just presented, for instance, some pretty attractive multiples of your own conversions and even greenfield combined cycles, the multiples of EBITDA at current, I think, roughly current power prices so perhaps a little bit more of a deeper dive on the ledger?</p><p>And if I will, I'll just ask a second follow-up for the sake of getting it all out there. Just talk a little bit about the Alberta market, given the new government and potential, I suppose, consolidation of different regulatory regimes and under what house I'm thinking MSA here and what could happen and how you think about future iterations of changes in rules? I'll leave it broad.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Okay. So Brett, I'll get you take the first question, and John, the second and I'll do cleanup.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Yes. So pluses or minuses, sorry, you certainly -- the Suncor announced Cogen, which is planning to come in, they say, in 2023. We've -- that's been on our radar for some time and we factor that into our models. John showed a chart from EDC that has pretty robust growth going out, but even if you look at more conservative growth in that 1% per year, which is being a bit conservative based on history, there is a need for new generation coming into the market. There are other units, as John said that coal units, smaller coal units, well, see they're not ours, but may have to come out of the market soon. And what they do with those.</p><p>So there is a few pluses and minuses that we see when we run our models that balance out. And with the positive economics that we showed you, even if our generation is slightly lower, we're getting much higher margins out of it. And you actually see that when you compare our 2018 to 2019 how we've been able to -- all the work Wayne's been doing and this is just on coal firing. So we see our margins improving over time.</p><p>Longer term, as our chart shows, eventually maybe this wasn't clear, the boiler conversions are -- have a hard date to them, okay? They can only run a certain amount of years post their coal life and it depends on their emissions test. So eventually, long term, those units have to come out, whether they're ours or somebody else's. So new capacity will have to come into the market.</p><p>The final point I'll make is if you look at a brand-new combined cycle trying to come into this market, clearly, it's dependent on gas prices. Generally, you're going to need probably about $55 to $65 per megawatt hour price over time to get a good return on and of your capital and pay for your cost.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: John?</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Julien, I think your second question was just about some of the additional changes that are happening in the market and what the impacts might be based on what the new government is looking at doing. I think there's only 4 things that they're looking at doing. Net-net, we candidly don't think it's going to change kind of our investment thesis in terms of what it is that we're doing, but they are just very quickly -- one of them is just getting certainly on the carbon pricing. We're expecting that in about a month or so.</p><p>The second thing that we're looking at doing is the AESO has been tasked at looking at the price ceiling, price floor and trying to make sure that we've got a workable regime as it relates to shortage pricing in the marketplace. That consultation hasn't really begun. They've been tasked with providing an update to the government I think in February of 2020, with landing any of the changes that we have to those rules kind of in the summertime next year, sort of July of 2020, so that is an ongoing piece of work.</p><p>And in general, I think the concern there is just making sure that there's enough signals to ensure there is appropriate build and to ensure that reliability is appropriate for the province.</p><p>The third thing is, again, and the AESO has been tasked with this, is looking at market power and looking whether or not there's any mitigation that's required. I think that's scheduled to be completed just before Christmas, late November. There hasn't been, at least to my knowledge, any sort of consultation that's really been initiated. We've had some discussions around that. I can tell you our view as a company is that everybody in the market should be treated in an equivalent way, and frankly, the focus should be more on time period just when there isn't tightness in the market in terms of bidding behavior rather than those time periods when there is tightness in the market, where you actually want people to be dynamic in their bidding.</p><p>And then the last point, which you alluded to was the whole notion of just all of the various entities that we have that oversee the marketplace. So all of the agencies are being reviewed, the Department of Energy has been tasked with looking at that. I don't recall that there is a specific time line for that, and it is, as you alluded to the AESO, the MSA, our sort of internal view is that, that is oriented more towards the red tape cutting efficiency drive that the government has more than a wholesale kind of change in dynamics or the approach that those agencies are going to be taking in overseeing the market.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: If I could clarify just quickly on that. Net-net, it doesn't sound like borrowing obviously resolution on some of the carbon details, I think material changes with respect to markets, obviously logistical and organizational changes.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Yes. I think that's fair. In fact, if you were to look at the key piece of legislation or regulation that kind of governs behavior, it's literally like 10 sections, it's a 10-page kind of document. It is, as I mentioned, a relatively pure market and regulatory light and we continue that to -- we expect that to continue.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Great. Next question? That way -- that side.</p><p>ROBERT HOPE, ANALYST, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Rob Hope, Scotia. Actually, maybe just a follow-up on terms of the carbon, it seems that the plan's based on $30 carbon. Do you see that progressing up to $50? Is that included in the plan and can you just talk about some of the flexibility in your coal-to-gas conversion plan depending on where carbon goes?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Go ahead. I would get on a soapbox and talk for an hour, so you can just answer.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: So look, it's a great question. So we model it out when we look at our investments on a variety of ways. I think our base case is basically a $30 case. Our sense of it is that, that is where broadly the government of Alberta is right now. I think from a longer-term trend perspective, when you look at where the federal government is going, we have elections that are in place, we'll see what ends up happening depending on who wins the election and whether or not the approach of the federal government has on trying to impose ever-increasing carbon prices among the jurisdictions. I think the trend is for higher carbon, generally, across the jurisdiction, and I think even in Alberta, the government has a pretty good understanding that we have an excess supply of gas in the jurisdiction, frankly, when it comes to our sector, having a pretty good, pretty robust carbon price actually increases the consumption of gas in the province net-net actually helps the dynamic for the gas industry in the province. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of a sense of...</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. I mean I would just speak crystal clear. The current federal government has definitive rules that require the provinces to ramp up to the $50 to be equivalent. And if you don't do that, they'll put a backstop in place and they did do that in Ontario. So depending on what happens in the election, if it is.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: And the courts are holding them up, sorry to cut you.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. If it is a liberal majority, that is the current legislation federally. And if Alberta wants to do something differently, for example, if Alberta wanted to negotiate a longer-term $30 framework for some reason, Alberta has to work proactively with the federal government to get that deal. So we model $30 but we don't model down from there. So we don't see a case where it's less than $30, and we will model the $40, $50 to test our assumptions, but we model an upward increase in carbon tax rather than downward.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Yes. And in terms of our plans, you can imagine if it goes to $30, the gap between coal and even the boiler conversions even gets wider and then even the combined cycle. So our plans actually fit nicely as prices go up, and you've got to remember, even a gas peaker in the market today probably has a range of heat rates, it's not dramatically different than some of these coal units. So they're going to also -- that -- part of that increase in carbon cost could get reflected in the energy price because of the higher cost in the market.</p><p>BENJAMIN PHAM, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: It's Ben Pham, BMO Capital Markets. So you had that slide highlighting expense evaluations, just breaking out the net asset value. On the Hydro side, I'm curious the $2.5 billion, how you're getting that because it seems quite conservative when you use kind of multiples that procures paying for asset. And another thing is, I think you mentioned a few years ago around -- issues around dropping down an asset to renewables, is that still the case there? How do you think about the drop down potential for Hydro Asset?</p><p>WAYNE ALEXANDER COLLINS: Yes. So let me start on the valuation side. So the valuation is relatively straightforward, just looking at something like John spoke in his slide about $200 million plus of EBITDA long term, once the PPA expires and we're using generally the multiple that we negotiated with Brookfield of the 13x on the valuation. That kind of sets up that $2 billion, $2.5 billion range.</p><p>As far as drop downs, so at this point, we're not really thinking about the Hydro Assets as a potential drop down into renewables, I think that was the question, simply because they are merchant based and it really doesn't fit the risk profile of TransAlta Renewables.</p><p>LEE MATHESON, PARTNER OF INVESTMENTS, EWING MORRIS &amp; CO. INVESTMENT PARTNERS: Lee Matheson, Ewing Morris. Further to Ben's question, now that you have Brookfield as a financial partner, have you contemplated using backstop PPA using Brookfield's balance sheet on Hydro Assets to then make them more appealing to be able to do a drop down into RNW similar to what Brookfield did with Greenlight's hydro on -- going back I guess 15 years. Again, in essence if the market is never going to give you credit for what it is, can you not manufacture that financially?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Go ahead, Brett, you want to take that?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Yes. I mean we've always thought about the Hydro assets even before the Brookfield deal and whether there's an opportunity there, but again, when we look at the Alberta opportunity that we're going into here and as it comes off the PPAs, we see quite a bit of value there. So at this stage, I would say no those -- we're not considering this. We'll -- who knows over time, but certainly we're less about are we getting credit for their Hydro? I think our view is we're probably not getting credit for the thermal is our general view. And now as we've laid this plan out and that we've life extended these assets showed you they're going to generate very good cash flows going forward, that's where we think the value gap is probably at. These are always uptight in the other assets, sure. But -- so no, the answer, short answer is no, we're not evaluating that right now, and we're more focused on other contracted assets that could go into RNW.</p><p>LEE MATHESON: And just as a follow-up on in terms of some of like the TA cogen assets, there's been a change in control at Sheerness with ECP, can you just walk through what your thoughts are on those assets? They seem sort of like I mean, I don't think they really got a slide in the 85-page deck, so what is that, what can we imply from that?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: I mean...</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Go ahead.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Yes. So it's an important asset in the TA cogen part. I mean we have effectively net to our company, a 25% interest in Sheerness. I mean they are moving forward to convert that plan. I don't actually think the transactions actually closed yet. I think it's still conditional and they're working it through. Right now, from our perspective on that, it's just steady as she goes, we haven't -- we're just viewing it as being one of the key assets that's in that partnership arrangement we have with our partners and there's no suggestion that we do anything with that asset at this point.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. I think they are currently going to do a dual fuel, so they'll be able to run on coal and gas, and then we expect them as they move through the mid-25s to turn that to gas.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: I mean they've been working to get gas supplies sorted out and we've been supporting them in that process.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Okay, who do...</p><p>ROBERT MICHAEL KWAN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Robert Kwan, RBC. If I can just ask about capital allocation and first on the dividend, just wondering what the thought process was around payout ratio policy around FFO versus free cash flow. And then as you're in this capital build, do you keep the lower end until you're exiting the coal conversions?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. I mean so first of all, we wanted, to date, really set a very comprehensive framework for how we're thinking about everything, because we didn't want to walk away today and then somebody said, well, you didn't tell us about what you're thinking about the dividend, so we spent a lot of time looking at free cash flow, looking at ways that other people do their dividends and we like the -- when it all settled down, it was clear to us that investors are having trouble seeing how the 2 companies fit together.</p><p>So remember we've been in coal since the '50s. We built most of our units in the '70s. We built additional units in the 0s and the company's had a run rate of capital for a long time based on capital and coal plants, which is significantly different than gas. So when we put all of that together, and then of course, looked at what our current dividend was, we wanted to be able to indicate how the -- how we would guide the Board to think about it. And what Todd said is we're in that kind of 10% to 12% range now. And I think we do fundamentally, as a team, believe that you have to tether your growth strategy to something. And it can't be just growth. We just want to add more and more projects. So what is going to frame and tether and pull all this together?</p><p>So there are 2 tether points, one was the debt and that's the 3x that Todd did a really great job of laying out. Because we believe fundamentally that makes sense for the mix of assets that we'll have that are contracted and merchant. It's a lot lower than you would see in a utility, and it's about in the range that I think IPPs are thinking about. And so then it just came back to the dividend. So at this point, as we look at it, we like that range of 10% to 15%. We do want our Board to have a discussion about it annually, look at the in-year cash flows and also look prospectively at the cash flows. And we just think it's an important principle for the company to have that you have confidence that as you're going, you're achieving the cash flows and that you're sharing some of that with the shareholders. So does that make sense? And really it's the way we we're -- we want you to -- that's how we're actually thinking about it behind the scenes, so we wanted to make that very transparent.</p><p>ROBERT MICHAEL KWAN: Got it. Just finished with the second part on capital allocation. You show the chart with your stock at 2.9x EBITDA. You are allocating a new growth circa 10-ish times EBITDA, at least with the renewables. With a gap that wide, what's kind of the thought process of continuing to allocate capital to projects like that versus just giving that lift that you see just buying back stock?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: So -- and I'll try this and then Brett will make it right. So no, I won't, Brett will make it right and then I'll say, yes, Brett, made it right. Go ahead, Brett.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Yes. I think you got to -- the way we look at it is, we're investing in those combined cycles and extremely good projects. The renewables, which is more the RNW-type multiples, which is akin to what we're investing at. So again, remember, most -- the contracted stuff is well suited for RNW at some point, if it's not there already. And so we're investing that kind of capital in what we see as extremely good returning projects in Alberta because of the high returns we can get off those combined cycle or boiler conversions. So I would look more at the 3x multiple against that, and then the renewables against more of the RNW side because we stripped it out. But at the same time, we still have the commitment to buy up to $250 million of shares over the next 3 years and that was part of the Brookfield transaction that we did. And so it's a balanced capital-allocation approach and investing also to extend those assets over the long term.</p><p>ROBERT MICHAEL KWAN: Got it. So when you're doing the renewables, you're really thinking about it as developing and effectively warehousing it for RNW purposes?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: That's correct. I was -- we really need to break the back of that assessment. So when we look at TransAlta as a whole, and we -- I thought we did a really great job of showing the deconsolidated side there. What we see is, you know, those 10x are really going into renewables, and there is cash building up in renewables that needs to be either reinvested or they need to increase their dividend. And we make sure that we're getting valuable investments into renewables, which is what Aron's session was all about. But we -- so we see the 10x renewable investments being in the renewables entity. We see the coal to gas and hydro being in TransAlta's -- inside TransAlta. Of course, the cash flow comes back in from renewables. And I think that's exactly the point, the exact point is if we start something in TransAlta, there tends to be a lift for TransAlta shareholders as we move it into all of our cost of capital entity and that's the -- so the TransAlta shareholders get 2 benefits. One is that lift. And the second one is, they get to reinvest that cash or take it back.</p><p>MARK THOMAS JARVI, DIRECTOR OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mark Jarvi from CIBC. Just wanted to delve into some of the commentary and details around the coal-to-gas-conversion strategy. A couple of different items here. One would be, a little vague on what the plans are for Sun 3 and 4, whether or not you guys would actually just maybe completely shut those down. Do you guys factor in -- and certainly revenues coming into the repowering assets and then what would tip you to go to 3 units repowering?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: So yes, as we -- as you know, there's 2 units mothballed today. And so as we -- and they're mothballed till November 21. As we kind of get through next year and into 2021, we'll look at just the market fundamentals. And it's a matter of -- and we just bring them back as coal units and just coal-fire them. Because you know, to be honest, they're not going to likely run. Remember, a coal unit coal-fired, a 400-megawatt unit can burn about 30% gas with no modification and the rest coal. But if that unit only runs 30%, it's burning 100% gas. So we pull back on the coal. So those units could come into the market just simply as is, and we could coal-fire them if we think the market needs them. Or because the payback is so high on that capital investment, we could convert them to -- through a boiler conversion and then decide if we do another hype or combined cycle on them. So we'll get through as we start to, kind of, make our way, see what some of the market changes are, see what the fundamentals look like, that's when we'll assess those units and make our decision.</p><p>In terms of a third, as I said in my section, we're really trying to balance how much we can fund through our funds flows and also have a little cost set of assets. So that's where we landed on being able to do the 2 combined cycle units. That's not to say and I just want to make sure it's clear, when Wayne showed those units coming off. Those were those boiler units coming off, converted units, because they have a hard date. We can then repower some of those. And we mentioned this on Keephills 3 for example, into combined cycle units because now the boiler we don't need. But if the steam turbine still in good shape and some of the other infrastructure there then we can put another gas turbine on that unit and basically now run it for another 20, 25 years. So there is the opportunity later on to do more combined cycle repowerings. Right now we're just kind of balancing between the capital, the market dynamics and that's why this plan, to us, made a lot of sense.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: So just another way to think about it, depending on how to manage supply in the province. If you do some of the math behind our plan, there is capacity that starts to free up by 2025 to finance a third conversion. And the team in 2023, 2024 could actually look at either doing a combined-cycle plant on one of the units that's already been converted to gas or they'll have the other ones. In the Alberta market, however, if it -- if the conditions change and those units that are mothball become profitable, Wayne would have to bring them back into the marketplace. So he has to attest that the amount of megawatt hours that he sells out of the units in terms of price doesn't cover their variable cost. And so as long as they are still on our fleet, if market conditions do change, they do have to come back into the system.</p><p>MARK THOMAS JARVI: And then just on the revenue streams between market and ancillary revenues, just any assumptions around that for the conversions and even power?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: You mean for the thermal side or the hydro?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes, how much?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Yes. I mean if you look, and this is -- if you just go on the AESO website, you'll see we sell ancillary off of the 2 Sundance units today. Generally, it's in around the 80 megawatts. Now it's not always 80 every day. We can probably anticipate that kind of level going forward, but it'll vary between 0 and 160 if you will. But they are available to participate, our hydros I mean, participant as you know. And the PPA units, that's not ours, it's still the Balancing Pool. So if they're -- anybody's going to bid ancillary, they get to, until we get off those PPAs in 2021.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Back to Julien, I guess.</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: Again, Julien Dumou. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of the conversations that have just happened, just to clarify some of the financial points you made. With respect to the capital allocation through '23, if I'm reading it correctly, right? You have the step down in leverage metric simply because of, a, the conversion of Brookfield, which I think you mentioned in your remarks? Separately, you've got the step up in cash flows from the conversions, right, I think which come in after '23. And then thirdly, you have a run rate of cash flow from the renewables assets that you're investing to grow.</p><p>So I suppose, first off, how do you think about just, kind of, the step up even beyond that '23, I know we're a little early but I'm sort of curious. And then coming back to that prior comment on the capital allocation piece of CapEx, you talked at length in various points about cogen investments, you showed, again, the multiples of investing. And again, if you go back to the point of the third combined cycle, it would seem, at least on paper today, that the multiple is reasonably attractive. I don't want to put words in your mouth. How do you think about your disclosure, where I believe you are not assuming RNW drops, you have a placeholder for buybacks. How do you think about eventually making this decision about to make the RNW drop and then subsequently these CapEx opportunities, just like even from a time line prospective?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: So Todd, do you want to take that?</p><p>TODD JOHN STACK: Yes. Maybe I can just start with the leverage graph you were talking about, it was on Slide 87 that shows sort of where we're at today as where we're at, I think we called it Post Hydro PPA. That's not really looking at the '23, '24 period. That's looking really right after the PPAs expire at the end of 2020. And so what you're seeing there is the repayment of that additional bond coming up next year in our leverage as well as the step up in EBITDA from the hydro assets once we get the full revenue from it. So it's not out as far as you are thinking, it's more near term. And then did you want to...</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: So Brett, go ahead please.</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Can you repeat all the...</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: When do you make the...</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Julien, can I? I think what you're asking is, how would you think about doing a contracted cogeneration with a 20-year contract compared to a third combined cycle, if -- I was to simplify?</p><p>JULIEN PATRICK DUMOULIN-SMITH: Yes. And just the time line of that versus just simply announcing the drops to create the headroom in your capital plan too?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Right. So Brett?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: So the drops, we've done a lot of drops. And they just -- it's a process, it's ego -- it's related parties, so we have to go through all that process. So that's just a matter of timing. And you know, quite often, we'll acquire some of those assets early-year staged, get them up and running and then drop them in. Sometimes we'll drop them in earlier. So there's no magic, if you will. But once they're suited, then it makes sense to get them over there if that makes sense to both parties.</p><p>You got to remember on the boiler conversion, first of all, the payback is huge, out of the gate with the carbon savings and the outage time, as Wayne says, those units are only out 6 weeks, maybe 8 weeks for the actual work. The combined cycle is in full permitting process. We got to go through -- it's a longer time frame. And so getting some of these boiler conversions done and just getting that savings as soon as we can and being positioned when gas is cheap. As I mentioned to you earlier, some days we saw negative gas in the last couple of months. We just want to be positioned to capture as much of that as we can. And so that's, again, we're back to this balance that we strike when we run all of our models between putting a ton of capital in the length to convert versus building a combined cycle. Our plan kind of looked as we described here. That's not to say we don't, kind of, modify it as we go forward. And like I say, do more combined cycles down the road when the opportunities are. Does that kind of capture it? I mean from a balance sheet perspective, I'd like to talk about this. I mean we showed, we only have $1.2 billion of bonds at the end of 2020 at the TA level. Remember that's being supported by these hydro assets, which have a ton of value and all this converted, so balance sheet-wise, in very good shape from that perspective over the long term.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Any question?</p><p>JOHN MOULD, ANALYST, TD SECURITIES INC., FIXED INCOME RESEARCH: John Mould with TD. I'd like to ask about new markets and how are you thinking about those? A number of your Canadian peers have, I guess, looked for growth all over the world. Maybe putting Australia aside for a second because that's a bit of a one-off for a U.S. company. How do you think about potentially looking at other markets beyond Canada or the United States, and what would it take for you to make that decision?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Well, I mean, I think that's -- it's hard to see you guys through these things. But I would say that when I -- when we look at the U.S. market right now, there's quite a demand for what Aron talked about in terms of these corporate customers that are looking for some sort of product for their own ESG goals and that has changed significantly, so there is a pretty big market there. And it's surprising to me how underdeveloped the market is for the actual developers that provide those projects. So there's -- it's still kind of more of a cottage industry. I mean, expect for -- I mean NextEra is a big player and there is a few big players. But there isn't really as many people as you would expect to see given the amount of demand. So I think part of our work in the next year, which Aron's team is doing, is to really say, okay, how much can you get there and are the returns too low.</p><p>Now we've seen that the returns currently are definitely too low on solar, like they're just not worth looking at. But there are people who buy them, I don't understand it but they do. But still in the wind space, if you look at our Skookumchuck project. I was just there probably 2 weeks ago, climbing all over a mountain looking at cranes and planes and automobiles to try to put all these things up, and it's still a fairly complex build because you're putting up 90-meter towers and they are big, big -- it's a big operation to get that thing built. So you can get the returns out of doing that still in the U.S.</p><p>We are seeing in our Australian operation -- of course, Australia is 100% focused on Asia. Like Australia is focused on Asia and Canada focuses on the United States. And of course, there's a lot of work going on in Asia with the Canadian government, with TPP and things like that. So we are seeing, for example, in parts of Asia, where coal plants are being canceled daily, like literally 20 coal plants have been canceled. I think it's in Indonesia, they just will not allow them, they have uprisings against them, they do not want them. And there's just a ton of solar being built there and it's -- these are brand-new markets with long, long time frames against them. Which goes back to what I was saying earlier, I think you're going to see, over the long term, quite a buildout of renewables globally. And so we'll -- the way we tend to do things is we'll start a desktop study, we'll start to think about what that looks like. We have lots of contacts and lots of ways to do different partnerships to start to assess that. You wouldn't see that from us though in the next couple of years. We've got this plan to deliver. We've got good profitability in this plan, the cogeneration space is a nice little space. And again, it's not an easy space for a lot of competitors to come into because it takes complex engineering and process engineering and marketing and trading to be able to put all those together. So we're focused there, but that's not to say that the team, 3 or 4 years from now, won't have started to think about what's going on in other parts of the globe.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENFIELD, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, INDUSTRIAL ALLIANCE SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Jeremy Rosenfield with Industrial Alliance. So just a couple of questions to clean up on. First in terms of the outlook for gas supply via second pipeline, I believe. I'm just wondering if you can sort of update us on that and does that have to be in service by 2024 for the 2 repowerings. Just clarify that.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Brett?</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: Yes. So we actually have 2 already. So Pioneer is one and it can go up to 440 at full capacity. There is actually an existing pipe into the site, so it was built when the plant started for start-up gas. So that's what we've been using up until now for even coal-firing. It's a small pipe. It's only 12-inch going up to keep those an 8 there, so there's limitations to it. So we are looking at potentially a third into the site, just to have that reliability. Even though, Pioneer can handle a lot, we just want to have the flexibility. Yes, we would look to probably have that third pipe available in that kind of '23, '24 for the hybrids for the repowered combined cycles. And then manage what we've got today to manage our coal firing and the boiler conversions up until then.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENFIELD: And then I had a question on hedging, just looking forward, when you think about the power trading operations in the upper (inaudible).</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Well, can you -- will you repeat the question?</p><p>JEREMY ROSENFIELD: So when we look to 2020 with the change in the structure of the Alberta hydro assets, and you think about how you're going to hedge in 2020, and how you're already positioned. And then just longer term, if there is a broader change in the strategy around trading in the Alberta power market and hedging your open positions going forward?</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Yes, sure. So the question was, I don't know if people heard, just wanting -- I mean if I can sort of synthesize it. Basically, a bit of an overview on where we are from a hedging perspective in 2020, 2021, given sort of the market dynamics that are there. I think when we look at 2020, it's more of a normal year, if I can say that, because a lot of the PPAs in terms of the structure of the market is a more of a continuation of what we have today. So the team is looking at layering in appropriate hedges for the 2020 period and we've started doing that and expect it to be by and large kind of a normal year for us in terms of where we go from hedging perspective.</p><p>When you look at 2021, we will be more merchant in Alberta. And we are evaluating kind of what would be an appropriate level of hedging in terms of 2021. You have to remember that in Alberta, it's like you've got multiple years of liquidity in terms of being able to hedge. It's more of a 2020, a bit of 2021. So we're looking at that, assessing what the levels of hedging should be. Remember, we typically only hedge the thermal component of our portfolio, not the wind or the hydro. So that's in full flight and we're considering that with a view to what we're going to do on our C&amp;I business. In terms of that, also providing a bit of a hedge. I think overall, general sense is kind of keeping our hedge levels broadly where they've traditionally been is about where we are. So at least when I think of it, that's kind of in that 70% range in terms of being targeted at an appropriate time. So hopefully that gives you a bit of a flavor.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENFIELD: And if I can, just one more question.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: My one question rule is not working here today.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENFIELD: Well, it's all right. It's all...</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: I know, I know, I know. Okay, the new rule is one question and one follow-up. But this is your second follow-up, Jeremy.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Yes, it's all good.</p><p>JEREMY ROSENFIELD: I'll leave it here after this one. Okay. So just in terms of on-site renewables and cogeneration opportunities, Aron, you mentioned before. Just do have sort of a ballpark in terms of total investment opportunity as to what that market might look like or what it might become in Alberta going forward just to give everybody, I think, a sense as to how big the opportunity is?</p><p>ARON JOHN WILLIS: Yes, I mean it's hard to ballpark because each of these plants is bespoke, right? There's not a -- like I said in my remark, there's not a cookie-cutter solution that we're putting in. So it's not $100 million solution you multiply that by 5, 1 might be $100 million, one might be double that. But based on where our pipeline is at, we would like to see ourselves at -- just internally, we've kind set ourselves a target of 1 to 2 of these things every year. I would say the range of investments you'd be looking at would be $100 million on the low end to maybe $250 million, $300 million for something that I would say would be much larger, probably at the top end. So...</p><p>BRETT M. GELLNER: And Aron, I think, it's fair to say that Alberta, obviously, is a key market there. But it's not just Alberta, we are seeing opportunities. And on-site is not just cogen, it could be just behind-the-fence simple cycle or combined cycle units as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Rob Hugh, Telequest]. A quick question really on growth and things that you used to talk a little bit more about which were storage and batteries in Pumped Storage Brazeau. Where does that factor? What kind of dollars, are they bite-sized amounts? Are they massive amounts, which are pipe dreams at some future date?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. So if you look at Brazeau, I mean we still have that project. We still have it on our shelf as something that could be developed in somewhere around the mid-'20s, mid -- '25, '30. There's a discussion of a third combined cycle. And I think the reason people are -- I mean they're looking at these repowered combined cycles, they are fantastic investments. But we also have a carbon policy regime here in Canada, it's sitting at $30, it can go to $50. There are people who talk about it even going higher than that in post-2030 period. I can tell you, no amount of Tesla batteries will power Alberta, not going to happen.</p><p>I've been making it -- sort of one of the things that I do at the company to go and visit these guys that are building these flow batteries. There's some really, really interesting flow battery guys out there. They are way more advanced than I expected them to be. But I shouldn't have thought that way because when I think about how quickly solar has advanced. And I'm not surprised by the way in which people are starting to advance these flow batteries. Again, Alberta is not going to run on a warehouse full of flow batteries that are the size of refrigerators that are all tied together. It's just with 4 hours of storage. And I think the way to think about that is, when you have an 82% system load factor, 18% of the time the system itself doesn't need somebody to be running. But the 50% of the loads needs you to run 100% of the time. So if you decide to run 12 hours on solar and 12 hours on flow batteries, the capital requirements for that solar and flow batteries is too much, right? So you have to have something and that's where something like Brazeau comes in. So I think that the team can develop Brazeau as three 300-megawatt units rather than one 900. So we have work to do to sort of continue to look at that.</p><p>I think it is the competitor to the potential third combined cycle in Alberta in the mid-2025 and us figuring out how to do that in a bite-size is important. We can't do the big project, it's too much capital. You can't put $3 billion in a merchant market. But is there a way to look at doing one of those units one at a time and seeing how they would fit because, again, they're 100-year units. They're not 30 year, they're not affected by carbon tax. So it's still on our radar, but it's definitely not part of the plan in the next 5 years. So we're allocating -- we've given you a very clear picture of the next 5 years. And all the questions, they are about the 5 years after that. But we need to get these 5 years in. So and your other question was?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So no, it just really is a follow-up. If you could just compare for a second the cost on a pump storage versus a flow, since you touched on it. Is flow something that you really can look at yet or is it still too...</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. I was -- no, it's not. I was surprised actually, and we've got a young smarty-pants guy, that probably he'll be a future CEO sometime in his life, working on batteries. And I was very, very surprised. I think they're starting to come into that $2,000 a kilowatt range. They're competitive and it's exactly the same formula as the solar guys did. You invent the technology and then you get the guys in who can take the engineering and the procurement cost down. And then you've got to just keep getting money from places, and there's a lot of money for this. There's tons of money for these kinds of investments. So we've looked at one company extensively, we're going to look at 3 or 4 more. And I expect to be surprised. I think it is a market that's emerging.</p><p>RUPERT M. MERER, MD AND RESEARCH ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Rupert Merer from National Bank. Follow-throughing on Ontario. RNW-focused question here. John, you mentioned you're looking to re-contract the Sarnia gas plant, the contract is expiring starting the next couple of years, I believe. Can you give us your view on the Ontario market? Any opportunity to re-contract Sarnia, but also the opportunity to maintain the cash flows where they have been over the last few years.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: Yes. No, it's a good question. And actually I'm glad you kind of asked the question the way you did because that's actually the way we tend to look at it, is we tend to kind of look at it from the perspective of what are the cash flows of the facility and what do we need to do to layer on various levels of opportunity that we have to actually maintain it there. As I mentioned, I think we do think that we're going to see a capacity market here in the province. There -- it's an interesting market from our perspective because you've got a whole bunch of stuff that's contracted, you've got a relatively small piece that might become a capacity market and then you've got basically the nukes and a bit of hydro which are quasi-government owned. So it's the place that an IPP like us can play is a more compressed, if I can put it that way, plays. When it comes to Sarnia, in particular, we do -- we have already initiated discussions about what it is that we can do to actually kick out the time period for the contracts.</p><p>I think when it comes to the customers that we have in the region that we're currently supplying, whether it's power or heat or steam too, it's a very competitive facility. I think it would be hard for us to find a better alternative than us providing and meeting their needs on a go-forward basis. We've initiated discussions with the government and the AESO about what we can do from a contract perspective. We're assessing what the capacity market, if it came to that, would be able to provide us. But we're also spending a lot of time, and frankly, the team is spending as much time on this is trying to actually get other contracts. We are looking at the capacity. We've got there, we've got quite a bit of land that's there. We're developing the Bluewater Energy Park. So it's everything from no chemical processing plants to actually bitcoin-type companies that have high power needs. That we're actively trying to create sort of additional capital streams for the facility. So we're working hard to keep it flat, frankly, as we look at the 20 -- or do better than that as we look at the 2022 to 2025 time period. We've been at it for probably a couple of years already in terms of trying to move that forward.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: The greatest thing about Sarnia is it's in a nice -- sort of a nice location.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: It's needed.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: It's needed in that part of the grid and the customers rely on it for steam. And I don't think there's a need to build a couple of more cogeneration projects there because you can't get a long-term contract for Sarnia. So I think it's got all the right attributes that you need for re-contracting, but these things take a long time. You got to -- there's a lot of customers to work with and the AESO here in Ontario. So it'll muck along for a while and maybe we can advance it, but it could take right until the end of 2025 to get it done.</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: And we've -- and recently, I mean, the changes here have occurred, I think our customers are not getting the global adjustment charge effectively levied against the nail. It's one of the things we've been able to achieve there. So it's a pretty competitive power solution for them regionally, in terms of where we are.</p><p>RUPERT M. MERER: In Ontario, we have seen some gas plants get mothballed at the end of the contract, but that's not in the scenarios that you're looking at. You don't think the worst case could be that bad?</p><p>JOHN HARRY KOUSINIORIS: We're not, we're not. I mean our Mississauga plant was shut down, and to Dawn's point, it was located at an area where, candidly, the power wasn't required there, once its contractual life was over. But when we look at Sarnia, we think of just that industrial base in the Valley there effectively, and we think that it's got good potential to continue to operate.</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Yes. I think gas plants that are just supplying power to the grid, most of them don't run that much. That's not helpful. But Sarnia is a big thermal producer, so it's a true cogeneration, and it supplies steam to the customers. So it's a huge sustainability part of the Ontario grid and it does help in that part of the grid, so it's got a different set of attributes.</p><p>So we have time for maybe one last question. Is there anyone that hasn't had an opportunity to ask a question that would like to ask one? If not, we'll turn it over to someone that already has. No? Okay, here you go, Robert.</p><p>ROBERT HOPE: Sure. Rob Hope, Scotia. Getting a little bit of granular and I guess, maybe front-running near 2020 or 2020 guidance, which I would assume we'll expect in December. Just wanted to clarify the comments you are making on the increase in maintenance over the next couple of years, just given the outages that you're seeing there. Is that relative to the future run rate or is that relative to what we're seeing in 2019? And then all else being equal, let's assume power prices are relatively similar, kind of where do you see cash flow shaking out in 2022?</p><p>DAWN LORRAINE FARRELL: Okay. So we're not going to do 2020 guidance today. And I think that really if you think about we're doing an additional -- we're doing a coal-to-gas outage. So the -- we've given you $30 million to $50 million as the cost of what you need to do to do one of those outages. So you've got that to think about. And at the end of the day, we'll give you the guidance in December or January. But a great question to end on, I was surprised you didn't start there actually.</p><p>And so with that, listen, everybody, we really appreciate you taking your morning with us. I think we've given you lots of data and lots of granularity in terms of how we're thinking about our plan. I think it's comprehensive. We really would love to have time to discuss this with you over lunch. So if you can stay and have a sandwich with us or whatever it is we're providing, we'd love to do that. And yes, I don't know if you're getting -- what you're getting.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Coratti:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My name is Kris Coratti.\u00a0 I am vice president of communications and events at The Washington Post.\u00a0 Thank you so much for joining us here\u00a0 this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today we're going to talk about the future of healthcare with three prominent industry leaders who have decades of experience both in the public sector and the private sector.\u00a0 We're very thrilled to have all of them here with us today.\u00a0 But before we begin, I'd really like to thank our presenting sponsor, America's Health Insurance Plans, and our supporting sponsor, the University of Virginia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And now I'd like to welcome to the stage Matt Eyles.\u00a0 He is the incoming president and CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans.\u00a0 He's going to say few words.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>Eyles:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, good morning everyone.\u00a0 I'm Matt Eyles, incoming president and CEO of AHIP, the national advocacy association that represents health insurance providers and hundreds of millions of members they collectively serve nationwide.\u00a0 As a sponsor of this morning's event, it's my pleasure to welcome you.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us.\u00a0 And thank you to the speakers today who are joining our program.\u00a0 They are real leaders in healthcare who can help answer a critical question, one that is top of mind for millions of Americans: what does the future of healthcare look like for me?</p><p>Many of the debates and discussions inside the Beltway often illuminate differences of opinion.\u00a0 But improving healthcare so that it works for every American is a commitment that I'm confident we all share.\u00a0 Making coverage more affordable, simplifying the healthcare experience for consumers and patients, improving quality and outcomes, lowering the price of prescription drugs, solving the opioid crisis, ensuring access to care and coverage for everyone-these are commitments we all need to work together to achieve.\u00a0 That means building on what's working today.</p><p>Nearly 300 million Americans have insurance that covers critical benefits like doctor's visits, prescription drugs, and today, many preventative services, like screenings for cancer, cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes, are 100% covered by health insurance providers.\u00a0 More than 20 million Americans, seniors and those with disabilities, have chosen Medicare Advantage.\u00a0 Nearly 55 million Americans get their coverage through Medicaid managed care organizations.\u00a0 And 180 million Americans rely on their employer for coverage.</p><p>They know that if they had a medical emergency, if their child were diagnosed with a terrible disease, if they have an ongoing challenge, like managing diabetes or heart disease, their coverage will protect them from the vast majority of medical costs, and provide both health and financial security.\u00a0 That's a vital responsibility that AHIP's members work hard to deliver every day.\u00a0 And if we improve what's working today and fix what isn't, if all us-insurers, doctors, nurses, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies-work together, we can ensure that every American has access to affordable coverage and high-quality care.\u00a0 And we can ensure that America's healthcare future is bright.</p><p>I greatly appreciate The Washington Post for hosting this event today, and I look forward to hearing the insights of our speakers.\u00a0 We also look forward to working with you and all our state and federal leaders to lower costs, to improve healthcare and coverage for all Americans.\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>Coratti:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much, Matt.\u00a0 I would now like to welcome to the stage Carolyn Johnson from The Washington Post.\u00a0 She's going to lead our first discussion.\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>          The future of an evolving industry with Highmark Health CEO David Holmberg:       </p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I'm Carolyn Johnson.\u00a0 I'm a business of health reporter here at The Post.\u00a0 And our first guest this morning is David Holmberg.\u00a0 He is the president and chief executive of Highmark Health, which has a really unique vantage point in the healthcare system.\u00a0 They're a major insurer, one of the largest Blue Cross plans in the country, and they also own a large hospital system based in western Pennsylvania.\u00a0 So David has a great perspective on both kind of sides of the healthcare debate.</p><p>Today we'll talk about the insurance industry, the rising cost of medical care, and how that will affect healthcare systems over the next decade.\u00a0 And before we begin I wanted to let you know if you have any questions you can tweet them to us using the hashtag #PostLive, and I'll ask them to David.\u00a0 So one of the biggest kind of ideas about the future of healthcare right now is the idea of unusual bedfellow companies coming together, whether it's CVS-which most of us know as a retail pharmacy-buying a big health insurer, whether it's insurers buying doctors' practices and hospitals.</p><p>So you have a really interesting point of view on that because you've done it and you've seen it in practice for years.\u00a0 And so can you tell us a little bit about how that works and what the challenges are?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 First of all, we appreciate the opportunity to be here.\u00a0 You know, Highmark is the third largest Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in the country.\u00a0 We might be the craziest because we decided to preserve competition and invest in a hospital system.\u00a0 So in addition to being an insurer, we're responsible for the delivery of care.\u00a0 And that's really changed the game for us.\u00a0 I think all of these unusual combinations you're seeing are really driven by the fact that we're at a crossroads.</p><p>You know, the majority of our healthcare system was built for volume.\u00a0 It was built post-World War II to address accidents and infections.\u00a0 And today what's driving the cost of healthcare is chronic disease.\u00a0 And so what that's creating is a real opportunity for new companies, innovators, different kinds of partnerships than have ever existed before.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What are the challenges about that kind of a partnership though?\u00a0 Because insurers traditionally are focused on driving great bargains, getting good prices on things.\u00a0 And hospitals traditionally make money off of trying to get as much payment as they can for their procedures.\u00a0 So how do you balance those tensions?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, you have to get all the crazy people in the room and figure out who's the craziest.\u00a0 You have to think about this in a little different context than maybe an insurer has before, or a hospital system would before.\u00a0 And what we mean by that is, you know, we're at a crossroads.\u00a0 The consumers are demanding improvements in the quality of care, and the outcomes, and the value of care.\u00a0 But they're asking for it to be affordable.\u00a0 And that's what's changed.\u00a0 And that's what's driving all of this.</p><p>And so when you get in a room, you know, what you and I have to do is to ask everybody to take their hats off that they wear in their day jobs, and now think about the family or the individual as a whole, and be consumer focused.\u00a0 You know, my background is retail.\u00a0 I ended up in healthcare because I truly believe that healthcare is the new retail for the next several decades.\u00a0 And there's going to be an important transformation that happens here.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think that these kind of closed-loop systems are necessary for the future of healthcare?\u00a0 Talk a little bit about value and kind of how that is a different equation once you're on both sides.</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I think \"value\" means different things to different individuals.\u00a0 But from our perspective, having an integrated delivery system, finance and delivery system-we're the second largest in country.\u00a0 I believe 18.3 billion.\u00a0 And what we've learned from that is when you have all the pieces, all the tools together, what you can do is change how you're delivering care.\u00a0 Because you're not looking to do more procedures if you're a hospital president, and instead, you know, what you're looking to do is to create better value and better outcomes.\u00a0 And if you're an insurer, you're not just doing the finance piece of it, you're concerned about how do you actually change the care.</p><p>That's the real opportunity for us.\u00a0 We're at a very transformational moment here.\u00a0 And I think as an organization, we believe having that integrated model gives us a competitive tool so that consumers will have more choice.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But won't they be kind of stuck in their own healthcare universe, choosing one system or another?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, that can happen.\u00a0 But I mean, I'm a believer that-just like in any other consumer decision or a thing that people do-they'll do what's in their best interest.\u00a0 As we've said before, \"value\" means different things, but it certainly is about improving quality.\u00a0 It's maybe changing how outcomes are derived and doing it with the lens of affordability.\u00a0 And so what that'll do-you know, yes, you may have people that are willing to say, \"I don't need to have every hospital or every provider in the system in my network.\u00a0 And I'm willing to trade that to get higher performing, better quality people in their network.\"</p><p>And so it gives them choice, and it gives them options, which historically hasn't existed.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Well, let's talk about another area of cost.\u00a0 Drug prices are a huge topic right now.</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Uh-oh.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 President Trump, last week, gave a very much anticipated speech about his strategy on this matter, to lower drug prices for consumers and for the system.\u00a0 What were your initial responses?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think our initial response was, \"It's a step in the right direction.\"\u00a0 The challenge we all have is we're on the verge of miracle drugs.\u00a0 And the problem we all have is that those miracle drugs are going to have a miracle price, and how do you figure out how to pay for them.\u00a0 And I think what we saw this past week was a step in the right direction.\u00a0 But we really have to think about the whole healthcare system differently.</p><p>When I think about the 5 million people that we serve, 22% of the money that employers and individuals are spending on their healthcare is going to pharma.\u00a0 And that's not necessarily sustainable.\u00a0 What we have to do is to think about things differently.\u00a0 Highmark Health just partnered with a drug called Symbicort, which for the first time we'll pay for the drug, but it's all at risk, meaning they have to get the outcome that they promised in the TV ad and to the patient.\u00a0 And if we get that, then they should get the benefit of that, and they should deserve payment for that.\u00a0 So we think that's part of the model that has to happen.</p><p>Again, we've got to move away from volume, to value.\u00a0 So when people make decisions to invest in healthcare there's got to be returns on that investment that lead to better outcomes.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do those kinds of outcomes-based payments trickle back to the consumer at the pharmacy counter?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I think there's a number of different ways that that can happen.\u00a0 You know, I think you can do that through-I mean, obviously, most people when they're in a medical concern, or have a medical condition, they number one thing they're concerned about is getting better.\u00a0 We can never forget that.\u00a0 That's why our whole strategy is patient centered, clinician led, as we think about how we're transforming.</p><p>But then what happens is they start to be concerned about the economics.\u00a0 And so there's a lot of different ways you can transfer the benefit to the patient through your insurance rates, through copays and deductibles, and how you design products.\u00a0 And so the one thing I would just suggest-you have to remember though-is you can't disassociate pharma from the medical side of it.\u00a0 One of our biggest challenges today in America is unfragmented care.</p><p>So what's happening is one physician may see somebody for a cardiac concern.\u00a0 They prescribe a prescription.\u00a0 And then somebody else sees them for a pulmonary concern, and they give them a prescription.\u00a0 And so that fragmentation leads to conflicts, and it leads to inefficiencies, as well as poor outcomes.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you find that you have the toolset to be able to handle those kinds of situations better being both on the insurance and provider?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 I mean, you know, there's a lot of people who believe that data is the answer.\u00a0 I believe that insights are the answer.\u00a0 So we have an incredible amount of data because we're both an insurer and a health system.\u00a0 And so we're able to see the clinical data.\u00a0 We've invested, in our case, over $500 million in Epic and in the electronic medical records, which is really designed to coordinate care and to provide information that can be used.\u00a0 Plus, we're balancing that with the claims data that we see with an insured individual.</p><p>And so the real superpower that we're focused on-particularly with our partnership with Carnegie Mellon, and Johns Hopkins, and Penn State-is what do you with that information, and how do you turn it into predictive data?\u00a0 Our goal is for our folks to be able to reach out to somebody and say, \"You're on the verge of having diabetes,\" not see them after they have an emergency room visit and they have a crisis.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That sounds great.\u00a0 [LAUGHS]</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stay tuned.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So there are other costs of healthcare aside from drug prices, even though we talk about drugs a lot.\u00a0 A Health Affairs study last year found that the top 1% of spenders in the United States were responsible for something like the same amount of spending as the bottom 75 percentile.\u00a0 I'm just wondering, did these patterns hold up in your population?\u00a0 And also, what kind of solutions do you see when the problems of American healthcare being expensive are both prices, but also just the distribution of healthcare problems, and how do you see a solution there?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Again, I think that what we see, and the data certainly bears out, that you do have a small portion of the population, less than 5%, which drives the majority of the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 And we have to think about how we deal with that differently.\u00a0 In most cases, it's driven by chronic diseases.\u00a0 I mean, post-World War II, we built all these hospitals around the country, and we built a healthcare system based on infections and accidents driving the majority of our need.\u00a0 Today we look at it and it's about chronic disease: diabetes, COPD, congestive heart failure, those kinds of things.</p><p>And so what we're doing is wrapping these folks with a whole different model of healthcare.\u00a0 And you can only do that if you take the incentives away for transactional relationships.\u00a0 So what that means is we took the 2,000 most complex cases in Pittsburgh, for example, and we changed how we interacted with them.\u00a0 We changed, and partnered, and vetted with their primary care physicians.\u00a0 A different level of care.\u00a0 We call it \"extended complex care.\"\u00a0 And that did was, over 12 months' time period, we reduced their emergency room visits by 15%, and we've reduced the cost by 20%.</p><p>So they're getting better quality of life, better outcomes, and we're starting to get our hands around the cost.\u00a0 You can't do that if there's a disconnect between who holds the risk and who's actually delivering the care.\u00a0 And so our partnership, you know, changes that.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a hospital system as well, talk about kind of the future you see there in terms of expansion and growing because there's always a lot of growth happening in healthcare.\u00a0 And how do you see efficient growth since you're also trying to think about containing costs?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I think efficient growth is about having the right beds in the right places at the right times.\u00a0 I would tell you that I've never woken up any morning since I've been in this role, and questioned how many people we have in hospital beds.\u00a0 In fact, our objective is totally the opposite. \u00a0We want to keep people out of the hospital.\u00a0 We want to keep them healthy, and we want to treat them closer to their community.</p><p>So we're investing now in four neighborhood hospitals.\u00a0 And think of it as \"bricks and mortar light.\"\u00a0 The idea is that there's emergency room capability close to where you need to be in case you do have an accident.\u00a0 But also, there's a very strong team-based primary care component so that you can go see your primary care physician and be wrapped with somebody who understands PT or understands diabetes.\u00a0 And then the third component is we're embedding specialists for those folks where it makes sense.\u00a0 So that's one way we're tackling it.</p><p>The second thing we're doing is, in our case, we introduce same-day appointments.\u00a0 I don't know how many people in the audience would raise their hand to say, \"I called the doctor and I got in to see him that same day.\"\u00a0 What's changed for us is, in the last year, we did 238,000 same-day appointments, not only for primary care, but for specialists.\u00a0 And that's about access because the consumer is tired of having to fit into our schedule.\u00a0 They want us to fit into theirs.\u00a0 And so when we create access, what that does is you start to see the patients earlier on in a cycle, and less likely to see them in the emergency room down the road.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 What are the lessons you've learned about how this can be hard?\u00a0 Are there any negatives for patients-[OVERLAPPING]</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I mean-[LAUGHTER] I would say it's one thing to insure grandma.\u00a0 It's another thing when you're taking care of grandma, too.\u00a0 Healthcare is local.\u00a0 I mean, just like today's an election day, politics is very local.\u00a0 Well, healthcare is local as well.\u00a0 And when you have a family member that's in need, you know, what we've found is that it can be very emotional and traumatic time for people.\u00a0 And so we have to rise to the occasion every day.\u00a0 You don't get a second chance.\u00a0 And so we believe that you have to earn people's trust.</p><p>What we've found is you have a healthcare system in our country that people have invested many dollars in, and they've invested their personal equity into.\u00a0 And today, it needs to transform.\u00a0 And so what we've found is it's hard.\u00a0 We found that you can't just nip around the edges.\u00a0 You can't just go in and maybe do a better job of just one segment.\u00a0 We have to transform the whole.\u00a0 And the only way that's going to work is with organizations like ours, in a private-public partnership, that are willing to do the hard work, and make the tough decisions, and walk away from legacy bricks and mortar, invest in technology where it matters.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What do you think the role of technology is going to be?\u00a0 Because definitely one of the things swirling around the whole vortex of change in healthcare is these big tech companies sitting on the sidelines, maybe going to jump in at any minute, and we're all kind of wondering when.\u00a0 Where do you see technology having a real potential?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, I'd say let's go.\u00a0 I mean, we've seen others who have stepped in before.\u00a0 There's a reason why healthcare has been such a tough nut to crack.\u00a0 I mean, I think where technology is going to really matter is, first of all, with data.\u00a0 So think about it today.\u00a0 There's so many devices out there. \u00a0You can get so much information about what your health status is, what your pulse is.\u00a0 I mean, I wear one when I run.\u00a0 And all that data, you know, you've got to do something with it.\u00a0 And so it's all unstructured.</p><p>I think the superpower that we're working with, with Carnegie Mellon and Highmark Health, is we're going to take that data, plus your clinical data, plus your claims data, we're going to put it all together, and use that for insights.\u00a0 And that will be the real opportunity.\u00a0 I also believe that there are real innovations that are changing how care is delivered.\u00a0 Let me give you one example.\u00a0 In Pittsburgh, we're the largest health system with the most robotic surgery rooms.\u00a0 So our operating rooms.\u00a0 What that means is more precision for the surgeons, better outcomes from the patients.</p><p>But you need to make investments in technology that solve real problems.\u00a0 You can't have technology that's looking for a marketplace.\u00a0 Instead, we need to say, \"What are the problems we're solving for as America,\" and then, \"What can technology do to fix that?\"\u00a0 And I think that's a little different perspective.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Do you think that these technologies are best developed in-house by people from the healthcare system, or do you see the real potential for disruption by people who may not be hidebound by the traditions?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's going to take both.\u00a0 I think what it's going to take is leaders who are willing to step up, and who are willing to be open to partnerships, who aren't going to be territorial and try to protect the past.\u00a0 For Highmark and for the Alleghany Health Network, our objective is to build the future of healthcare.\u00a0 And that means we want the smart people in the room at the table and making decisions.</p><p>One of our strategies, and we believe very strongly that clinical transformation and how you take care of people needs to be physician and clinician led.\u00a0 So we want the clinicians in the board room with us when we're making decisions.\u00a0 And I'm spending time in the operating rooms with them so that I understand what exactly is happening, and what their needs and concerns are.\u00a0 But I think that's a critical part of it.</p><p>And so, again, you know, our strategy has been to invite other people under the tent and come along the journey with us.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I had the pleasure of going to Pittsburgh and riding around with David to see a lot of the things he's talking about.\u00a0 So it is really kind of fun to get out of the office and see how you try and tackle these really complicated, chronic health issues, and change care using all these tools.\u00a0 On a different topic, we're at the beginning of the new cycle we have each year on the future of the individual market, and the Affordable Care Act with states beginning to report the rate requests the insurers have been making.\u00a0 Just how do you see the future of this market evolving?\u00a0 Tell us a little bit about the journey you've been through the last few years.</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 I mean, if you think about the Affordable Care Act, and the journey from 2010 to today, it's been a wild ride.\u00a0 In the early days, there was so much that was unknown.\u00a0 It was a costly learning experience for us.\u00a0 We make no bones about that.\u00a0 As we started to get to know the folks who had signed up, you know, we learned that there was a lot of unmet need.\u00a0 And along the way, what we've also learned is that there's a real opportunity to engage them differently with than what traditional commercial insurance did, or maybe Medicaid or Medicare had done in the past.</p><p>And so today we're cautiously optimistic.\u00a0 In 2017, we saw some stabilization of the marketplace.\u00a0 Now there's some new changes, and those changes are going to create more uncertainty.\u00a0 And the bottom line to it is, you know, the broader the pool of people you have involved, the more you can work within that pool to figure out how to make this sustainable for the long term.\u00a0 So we are seeing rate increases again for 2019.\u00a0 We're seeing new challenges develop as some people in and some people move out.\u00a0 But the good news is we have four years of history now on most individuals who have stayed in the exchanges.\u00a0 So it's a little bit more predictive and you can start to sort out how to be helpful.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So you see a road to stability in your mind?\u00a0 You don't see further chaos-[OVERLAPPING]</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think the road to stability depends on certainty of what the rules are.\u00a0 Tell us what the rules are, tell us where the field is, and tell us who the referees are, and I think the marketplace will sort itself out.\u00a0 I would say the jury is still out.\u00a0 We do see some level of stabilization, but with the new developments that have happened, it's to be determined.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 We'll wait and see.\u00a0 You haven't yet filed your rates?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No.\u00a0 I think in Pennsylvania-I mean, you know, obviously we're in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.\u00a0 Pennsylvania is actually next week, and then West Virginia and Delaware are in the next couple of months after that.</p><p>One of the things that we think is really important to understand is, you know, if you believe that value-versus-volume medicine is meaningful and that it can have an impact, then it's important to have an individual-if they're going to be in the ACA or any other kind of insurance-stay with you for multiple years.\u00a0 Because the work that needs to be done has to be done on the front end.\u00a0 You know, I mean, you have to change how you interact with them.\u00a0 You have to maybe catch up some of their care.\u00a0 And then over time you can shape their health outcomes through more interaction.</p><p>But if they're in the marketplace and then out, if they leave, they go somewhere else, it's really difficult to make those investments.\u00a0 And so we believe that stability in the marketplace is a good thing, and that there's nothing wrong with that.\u00a0 You know, the rest is to be determined.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Washington, we often talk about healthcare as a national problem.\u00a0 We talk about the national trends.\u00a0 And we talk about kind of the premiums rising.\u00a0 It's always very different though, state by state, even county by county.\u00a0 There can be different trends-</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Absolutely.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -and different things happening.\u00a0 Can you just, as a large regional player, what are the specific healthcare problems that you see are common with kind of the national trends, and where do you see any outliers?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I mean, I agree with you.\u00a0 I think the financing of healthcare may be a national issue, but the delivery of healthcare is local.\u00a0 And having spent much of my adult career in Texas, I know that the differences between Texas and the issue in Pennsylvania are pretty significant.\u00a0 And so what that means is it's not going to be-a sort of one-size-fits-all answer is not a magic wand.\u00a0 And in fact, it may create new issues.</p><p>If we're going to get this right, what we have to do is understand who are we serving.\u00a0 We have to have a strategy that's customer-based or patient-based, meaning that you understand what the needs are in south Texas versus what they are in northwestern Pennsylvania.\u00a0 And so what I see in the same sort of macro trends, you know, chronic disease, heart conditions, diabetes is running rampant across the country, and certainly is a challenge for us in Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, and Delaware.\u00a0 Mental health continues to be a concern, and how that relates to pain management, those kinds of things.</p><p>And at the same time, you know, what I see is hope.\u00a0 I see that there is a path forward if we're willing to make the tough decisions, if we're willing to do the right things, and break maybe from where we've been, and think about this differently than what we've done in the past.\u00a0 And I would say, in our case, we're starting to see the early days of that impact.\u00a0 And that's why our performance has improved, and that's why our outcomes are improving.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of insurers are very interested in a lot of the sort of social and environmental context around people's lives.\u00a0 And there's a lot of interest in the social determinants of health, that's what they call it.</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Absolutely.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basically, do you have transportation?\u00a0 Do you have food?\u00a0 Do you have housing?\u00a0 Economically secure?\u00a0 What are you doing in that area, if anything?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That's a great question because there's a whole bunch of environmental reasons why people can become unhealthy.\u00a0 Some of it's personal choice.\u00a0 Some of it's the environment they're in.\u00a0 We're partnering with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, for example, just one example, and providing transportation for people.\u00a0 So using Lyft in a pilot that we're actually doing in Pittsburgh, to make sure that individuals are making it to their doctor's appointment; finding ways to get them to, you know, when they need a treatment or get them to the pharmacy.\u00a0 That's an important part of it.</p><p>We have a pilot that we're doing on the north side of Pittsburgh, where we're working with some nongovernmental agencies, some foundations.\u00a0 And we're looking to take a whole neighborhood and see if we can apply a different model to it, where we address not only safety, but social issues, transportation.\u00a0 Because you can't disconnect the cost of healthcare and the condition of healthcare from jobs and education.\u00a0 If you have jobs, education, and a good healthcare system it becomes a little bit of a flywheel effect.\u00a0 It starts to take care of itself.</p><p>And so we think that we've got to figure out how to address these issues.\u00a0 At the same time, we have to understand whatever we do has to be scalable.\u00a0 I mean, in our case, we have 5 million people that we insure.\u00a0 We want to make sure that it's scalable for all.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Well, if you had to diagnose, I guess, the biggest problem facing American healthcare, what would you say?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 That's a tough one.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] You know, I think we don't like to exercise.\u00a0 No, I would say the biggest challenge is the healthcare system was built in a model that was based on past need.\u00a0 And the world has changed.\u00a0 I think the biggest challenge in healthcare is recognizing that we can-it's no longer about us, it's got to be about them.\u00a0 It's got to be about the people that we serve.\u00a0 And meaning, you know, we need to have a retail mindset where we understand what motivates that individual, how do we connect with them, and then how do we provide them the services and capabilities that fit their lifestyle and their choices?</p><p>You can't force somebody to do something.\u00a0 But what we can do is be in a position where we move from the healthcare system we've had in the past.\u00a0 We use technology, innovation, and a lighter version to engage people earlier on in their lifecycle, rather than waiting till they have a chronic disease to try to maintain it.\u00a0 You know, but instead to work on avoiding it.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And if there was one policy lever that you could pull to make your job easier or care better, what would that be?</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh, I think I'd have to think about that one for a while.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] I mean, I'm not a politician or a policy person in that sense.\u00a0 Much of what I do is play the hand I've been dealt.\u00a0 The one thing I would say from a policy standpoint is, let's have that ferocious debate.\u00a0 Let's talk through what really has to happen here.\u00a0 Let's not address the fringe, but instead let's talk about what really is necessary in order for the next 10 to 20 years to make healthcare sustainable and make it affordable.\u00a0 And then let's make the decision and let's go and do it.</p><p>And if we do that, and we keep the rules the same-we don't keep changing the rules as we go-what that'll do is allow the marketplace to make investments, to make investments in individuals up front, and not hold back and try to be transactional.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Well, thank you so much for your time.\u00a0 That's all the time we have for this segment.</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, David Holmberg, for joining us.\u00a0 And I will be handing this off to Lenny Bernstein.</p><p>Holmberg:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you very much.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>          An examination of public health with former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy:       </p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I'm Lenny Bernstein.\u00a0 I'm a health and medicine reporter for The Washington Post.\u00a0 Today our second guest is Dr. Vivek Murthy who was the 19th Surgeon General of The United States from 2014 to 2017.\u00a0 During his tenure Dr. Murthy grappled with the Ebola epidemic.\u00a0 He put out in 2016 a comprehensive look at addiction in the United States, a document that was sort of a call to action as previous surgeon generals have done with HIV and obesity.\u00a0 And, most famously, Dr. Murthy spoke with Elmo from Sesame Street about vaccinations.\u00a0 And is probably his most widely seen moment.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Today we're going to sort of take the temperature of the United States on public health, on some issues that you may have thought of and some others that you may not be thinking about.\u00a0 I am told to ask you to please tweet us some questions on the hashtag #PostLive.\u00a0 And, really, please do, because it's a rare opportunity to ask questions to someone who really, really understands and gets it.\u00a0 There's lots of public health issues.\u00a0 We usually talk about opioids at these sessions.\u00a0 But I'd like to start with one that's really not gotten the same kind of attention.\u00a0 You have been speaking and writing about loneliness as a public health issue.\u00a0 And I'd like to understand how you came to that issue and also why that is a public health issue.</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, it's so nice to be here with you, Lenny.\u00a0 And Lenny is a reporter I have great respect for, and I believe the work that you do as a journalist is especially important now compared to any other time that we have lived in.\u00a0 You know, the loneliness is an issue that I began thinking about actually quite some time ago, before I was even in office.\u00a0 When I was practicing medicine up in Boston I was practicing as an internal medicine doctor, taking care of people with diabetes, high blood pressure, different types of cancer.\u00a0 But what I quickly came to see was that the most common illness that I was dealing with was in fact not heart disease or diabetes; it was loneliness, and loneliness that stemmed from a lack of meaning, a lack of self-worth, and a lack of social connection.</p><p>And so I became intrigued by this and started to see more of this when I was surgeon general when I would visit communities around the country.\u00a0 Very few people would come out and just say, \"I'm lonely.\"\u00a0 That's not who people would talk about the issue.\u00a0 But when given the right opportunity, when asked the right questions, people would start opening up about the fact that they were in fact experiencing loneliness.\u00a0 Just a few months ago, for example, I was doing a radio interview, and there were several people who called in at the end.\u00a0 And one gentleman in his 40s called in, and he said, \"My best friend died a few years ago, and I've been profoundly lonely ever since then.\u00a0 And I just don't know what to do about it.\u00a0 And, as a guy, I feel like I can't really talk about that.\u00a0 It's not a very masculine thing to do to say that you're alone.\"</p><p>Another woman called in and she said, \"You know, my daughter just came back from her first semester in college, and I sent her to college thinking she's going to be with a community of people that she is connecting to, who she has fun with, who appreciate her for who she is.\u00a0 But instead she came back and she said, 'Mom, I'm connected to people all the time.\u00a0 You know, we're texting each other; we're messaging all the time, but nobody ever asks me about me.\u00a0 No one understands who I am.\u00a0 I feel so alone.'\"\u00a0 So I've realized that loneliness is far more prevalent than I thought.\u00a0 In fact, if you look at the data, the numbers are in the 20s to 30% depending on the numbers you look at.\u00a0 AARP, for example, did a study looking at people over 45 and found that nearly a third of them are in fact experiencing loneliness.\u00a0 So this is a profound issue.\u00a0 It turns out it also has public health implications.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, you've written some pretty startling statistics about the impact of loneliness.</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 So if you look at health, what you see is that people who are lonely live shorter lives.\u00a0 In fact, the reduction in lifespan associated with loneliness is similar to the reduction associated with smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\u00a0 It's also greater than the association with obesity.\u00a0 So just image for a moment how much attention we spend talking about, thinking about, and addressing obesity and smoking compared to how much we think about loneliness as a public health threat.\u00a0 But folks who are lonely also have an increased risk of heart disease, of dementia, of trouble fighting infections, so they have a weakened immune system.\u00a0 And they also have a greater risk of depression and anxiety.</p><p>But the consequences of loneliness actually go far outside of health too.\u00a0 It impacts your productivity in the workplace.\u00a0 It impacts how our children do in schools.\u00a0 And what I've begun to see increasingly is that it also impacts our ability to dialogue as a community.\u00a0 And so if you imagine the times that we're in now, when we are struggling with major challenges, whether it's the opioid crisis or climate change or other chronic illnesses, these require us to be able to talk to each other, to dialogue as a community.\u00a0 But we can't do that if we are in the chronic stress state that is triggered by loneliness.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So why would loneliness have the same impact as 15 cigarettes a day, just physiologically?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So it turns out there are probably at least two explanations for this.\u00a0 One is that it looks like people who experience loneliness actually have a difference in the health-related behaviors that they engage in.\u00a0 So they may be less likely, for example, to make the right choices when it comes to nutrition and physical activity.\u00a0 But there's another explanation as well which is rooted in evolution which has to do with the fact that loneliness triggers a chronic stress state in our body.</p><p>So if you imagine thousands of years ago when we were hunters and gatherers, being a part of a group was actually very beneficial because it ensured greater protection and a more stable food supply.\u00a0 In fact, when you were separated from the group is when you were more likely to get eaten by a predator or die from starvation.\u00a0 Now, think about the fact that that has been baked into our nervous system over thousands of years so that in the modern day and age when you are lonely, which is the equivalent of being separated from your group, having inadequate social connection, it triggers a similar stress response.\u00a0 And included in that stress response is hypervigilance.\u00a0 Right?</p><p>And so I mention this because in a situation where you are surrounded by predators, you want to be hyper-vigilant; you want to think that the rock that just moved over there might be an animal that's trying to jump out and come to get you, even if it's not.\u00a0 But in the modern day, if you are hypervigilance leaves you to suspect that people with good intentions have bad intentions, to suspect that people who perhaps aren't even interacting with you are trying to point at you or trying to threaten you in some way, you can imagine how this impairs our ability to actually dialogue and to interact with each other.</p><p>But the chronic stress that stems from loneliness, we know that that stress is connected with inflammation, which in turn is connected with higher rates of heart disease and many other chronic illnesses.\u00a0 So there are biological mechanisms through which loneliness may have its effect.\u00a0 That said, there are probably mechanisms through which we don't understand.\u00a0 But the bottom line is when you look at all the data on loneliness, the statistics, the biology of it, you're left with this inescapable conclusion that we need each other; we are fundamentally social creatures.\u00a0 It doesn't mean we're all introverts or extroverts.\u00a0 But both introverts and extroverts need some degree of human connection, even if we differ in how much that is.\u00a0 We haven't prioritized that really as much as a society.\u00a0 In fact, it's not that we have said connection is not important; we've just allowed our self to think that many other things are far more important, and we've taken our eye off the ball in investing in human relationships.\u00a0 And that has had its consequences in terms of our health.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, my kids tell me that they are connecting and hanging out with their friends, they're just doing it on phones and tablets and computers.\u00a0 Not the same?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Not the same.\u00a0 And the bottom line is not that technology is bad.\u00a0 In fact, I think, you know, as somebody who spent years building a technology company and has used technology a lot, I believe in tech, and I think it can be helpful to us.\u00a0 But technology ultimately is a tool, and how it's used is what makes a difference between whether it's helpful or harmful.\u00a0 And what you see with social media is that when you use social media as a way station, meaning if you use it as a tool for in-person interaction, as a bridge to in-person interaction, it can be quite helpful in helping build social connection, as it has been to me.</p><p>So when I go from one city to another, I might look up friends on social media just to see like, you know, \"Hey, which of my friends actually lives in Philadelphia now,\" or, \"Has somebody moved to Anchorage, or has somebody moved to Topeka?\"\u00a0 But if I'm primarily using social media as a substitute for in-person interaction, if I'm feeling lonely, for example, on a Friday or Saturday night and I say, \"You know, I don't have anyone to hang out with, but let me go on my social media feed and just scroll through people's posts and then I'll feel connected to them,\" that actually tends not to work.\u00a0 In fact, in that case you see that passive use of social media is associated with greater rates of anxiety and depression.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We can't just say, \"Okay, I'm not going to be lonely any longer.\"\u00a0 What do we do?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I think that there are a number of things that we have to do, like at an individual level and at a societal level.\u00a0 I think as a society, as organizations, whether you're workplaces or schools we have to think about how we create environments that foster authentic human relationship.\u00a0 And I say authentic human relationships because this is about more than just hosting happy hours and throwing people together in a room.\u00a0 It's about very intentionally trying to create opportunities for people to get to know each other on a deeper level.\u00a0 You know, people want to be understood for who they are.\u00a0 That doesn't mean that everyone wants to divulge their deepest and darkest secrets at work.\u00a0 But what it does mean is that they want to be appreciated for more than the person who knows how to do Excel spreadsheets and the person who is good at pricing strategy.\u00a0 People want to be known and appreciated as human beings, as moms and dads, as community members, as concerned citizens.\u00a0 And some of these exercises to enable that kind of interaction we actually created and built when I was in office, when I was serving as surgeon general, to help our own office foster stronger connections.</p><p>But on an individual level I think that there are also strategies that we can use.\u00a0 And I'll tell you this on a very personal note, because I myself am working on implementing these strategies in my own life because I too have experienced loneliness in my life.\u00a0 That's part of what brought me to this issue.\u00a0 When I was a child I was actually quite lonely in elementary school.\u00a0 I was very shy.\u00a0 It wasn't that I didn't want to interact with people, but I was lonely.\u00a0 And I had a wonderful family at home but lonely at school.\u00a0 And I never felt comfortable telling my parents that I was in fact lonely because saying I was lonely felt like saying I was not worthy of being loved.\u00a0 And that's what it feels like for many people to express their loneliness, which is why they don't.\u00a0 But this is why it was very personal to me.\u00a0 So coming out of office I looked at my life and I realized that I had allowed work to edge out a lot of my close personal relationships, and that had led me to be lonelier than I thought I would be.</p><p>And so the things that I'm doing now, which I think in general can be helpful, is, one, draw boundaries around technology so that you don't bring technology into your in-person relationships with other people.\u00a0 So specifically if I'm having dinner with my family, I try to leave my phone or my computer aside.\u00a0 If I'm catching up with a close friend, I try not to leave my phone open-faced so that I'm constantly looking at text messages or being distracted by alerts.\u00a0 But the other thing that I think is important to do is to also ensure that each day we have at least some authentic interaction with someone that we love.\u00a0 It could be one minute.\u00a0 It could be five minutes.\u00a0 It could be a text message you send to a close friend.\u00a0 It could be a quick call you make to someone you love.\u00a0 It could be picking up a call when you get it.</p><p>And I won't ask by a show of hands, but I know that many of us, myself included, have been guilty of seeing a phone call come from a loved one and then just not picking it up because we're worried that it will lead to a much longer conversation.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] And we don't want to take that risk, right?\u00a0 But, you know, what I have found is sometimes just picking up and saying, \"I can't talk to you right now, but, you know, it's so good just to hear your voice for 30 seconds,\" that makes a difference.\u00a0 So prioritizing relationships, protecting those relationships from the insidious invasion of technology, I think that these are both very important strategies to help us rebuild our connections in our life.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's great.\u00a0 That's great advice.\u00a0 That's why the surgeon general is America's doctor.\u00a0 A couple of quick questions about other public health issues that seem to have faded, possibly because we have made some progress, possibly because we're ignoring.\u00a0 Hypertension; are we moving forward, are we making progress on the amount of salt in our diet and the level of hypertension in the United States and all the problems it causes?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It's a good question.\u00a0 You know, high blood pressure is certainly something everyone has heard about, but you're not reading about it in the headlines every day.\u00a0 You're reading about the opioid epidemic; you're reading about violence from time to time.\u00a0 This is unfortunate because high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease more broadly is one of the leading causes of disease and death in the United States.\u00a0 And so one of the things that I think we have realized over time is that we have made advances in how to treat high blood pressure, in understanding what gives rise to high blood pressure.\u00a0 Where we have not made as much of an advance is in actually reducing rates of hypertension, of high blood pressure in the United States.</p><p>And I think that that is in part because I think we have not succeeded yet in taking a population-based approach to addressing high blood pressure.\u00a0 A population-based approach is not the same as an individual approach.\u00a0 An individual approach would be to say, \"Okay, when patients come to clinic then we'll talk to them about their diet and exercise and put them on the right medicines, and hopefully that will address hypertension.\"\u00a0 But a population-based approach says, \"Can we do things like reducing the overall sodium content in the foods that we eat by working, for example, with packaged food manufacturers, by working with restaurants and others to reduce that sodium content knowing that there is a connection between sodium content and high blood pressure?\"</p><p>It also involves thinking about strategies for increasing physical activity.\u00a0 Can we create more green spaces, more walkable spaces that will allow people to be more physically active so that it cannot only reduce rates of hypertension down the line but also have other benefits?\u00a0 When I was in office, for example, I had released a call to action around walking and walkable communities.\u00a0 And the reason I had done that is because it turns out that if you walk an average 22 minutes a day and you do so at a brisk pace, you can reduce your risk of diabetes by 30%, your risk of heart disease by 20%.\u00a0 But we're not really seeing a big investment in creating walkable spaces.</p><p>I guarantee you though, if I told you that I had a pharma company that had a pill that if taken once a day could reduce the risk of diabetes by 30%, I think I would do quite well.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Because people would say, \"Hey, that's a solution that we should invest in.\"\u00a0 But we have solutions like that sitting right in front of us.\u00a0 They're called sidewalks; they're called parks; they're called walkable spaces.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] But, you know, we need more people to make the case to congress and to other legislators that sidewalks are actually powerful public-health interventions.\u00a0 They may not look like a medicine that fits in a bottle, but they can have quite an impact on our health.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If I am manufacturer X, I am not about to reduce the sodium in my product, risk the taste, the loss of the profits, the loss of sales unless I know that all the rest of the manufacturers are going to do it.\u00a0 So how do we get that done?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is where, I think, government has an important role that it can play.\u00a0 I'm not somebody who believes that everything has to be done by government or that the private sector necessarily has to be overregulated, but I do think where the government can step in is to play a leadership role in bringing people together to make decisions that ultimately benefit all of us.\u00a0 And this is one example of that.</p><p>Very few companies are willing to take a risk on changing the sodium content in their products on their own for the exactly reasons you mentioned; they're worried if their products don't taste as good or if they taste differently, that people will shift their consumption to other companies, to competitors.\u00a0 But there are a couple of things that we know.\u00a0 One is that even if you were to reduce the sodium content in your food by, let's say, 10% or 20%, you might notice a difference, but over time and over, in fact, an order of weeks or a few months, your palate will change, and it will acclimate to the new level of sodium content that you have.</p><p>This is actually not just true with sodium.\u00a0 It's true with sugar as well.\u00a0 And we could do a similar thing with sugar as we need to do with sodium, which is to bring manufacturers together to reduce the sodium as well as the sugar content in their foods.\u00a0 Because right now it turns out that close to 75% of packaged foods actually have sugar in them as well, things that you may not think of like pasta sauce and bread and crackers.\u00a0 But it is very powerful.\u00a0 And I know this in part not just from the science but from some practical experience.\u00a0 So when I was in office, a group of us on my team decided that we were going to do a quote unquote \"sugar detox.\"\u00a0 So we gave up sugar for a period of 30 days.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just cold turkey?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cold turkey; we just gave it up.\u00a0 And giving it up meant that we didn't take added sugar in anything; we didn't buy or consume products that had sugar added to them that were unnatural.\u00a0 We could eat an orange, for example, but we wouldn't drink juices that had sugar added to them.\u00a0 What we found, which was really interesting, is our palate changed within the order of a couple of weeks.\u00a0 In fact, one of the men who was in our group who was participating in this, he came back from lunch with half an orange.\u00a0 And I said, \"Why didn't you eat your whole orange?\"\u00a0 He was like, \"I just couldn't eat it.\u00a0 It was too sweet.\"\u00a0 Everything suddenly tasted too sweet.</p><p>So the bottom line is, as human beings, we don't have to be worried that if we change the sodium and sugar content in our food that it's permanently going to change the quality of the food that we consume.\u00a0 Our palates will adapt.\u00a0 But the long-term benefits will remain.\u00a0 Government though I think can and needs to play an important role in bringing manufacturers to the table so that they can collectively make these decisions.\u00a0 And if they do reduce sodium and sugar content even by an incremental amount, it can have a profound effect on the lives of millions of people.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And sort of convince them that everybody is going to go along if they-they will acclimate to the same amounts of sugar across all these products?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0 Yeah.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A quick question about smoking.\u00a0 It's down to about 15% of the population, yet it is still probably the single greatest risk factor, cause of death in the United States.\u00a0 What needs to be done?\u00a0 What's left to be done on smoking?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, we've made a lot of progress, but we do have a lot of work to do.\u00a0 In 1964 when my predecessor Surgeon General Luther Terry published the first surgeon general's report on tobacco, smoking rates in the United States were around 42%.\u00a0 Dropping all the way down to 15% is a major, major public health victory that didn't come easily.\u00a0 It came because of the hard work of people in communities across the country who build education campaigns, who came together to change policy like increasing taxes on cigarettes and creating smoke and tobacco-free places.\u00a0 But it was an important victory.</p><p>That said, we still lose about half a million people every year in the United States due to tobacco related disease.\u00a0 And the more we learn about tobacco, the more we realize that there are more illnesses associated with than we originally thought.\u00a0 So in 2014, in fact, when the 50th anniversary of the Surgeon General's Report on Tobacco was published, it was recognized that unlike '64 when there was one cancer that was seen to be associated with smoking, and that was lung cancer, now there were over 13 cancers.\u00a0 There is also an increased risk of diabetes seen with people who smoke.\u00a0 Like that, more and more we see added risks of smoking.</p><p>What do we need to do?\u00a0 Well, I think for sure we have to double down on public health strategies that we have seen work when it comes to smoking.\u00a0 That means continuing to increase taxes on cigarettes.\u00a0 That has a profound effect particularly on youth utilization.\u00a0 So if we want to protect our kids, taxing cigarettes are actually a very important strategy.\u00a0 But the second thing that we have to do is we have to work on better cessation tools.\u00a0 We already have a number of FDA approved cessation tools that are on the market.\u00a0 They work well for some patients; they don't work well for all patients.\u00a0 And so we need better cessation tools.</p><p>Now, people have asked about e-cigarettes in this context.\u00a0 \"Are they the cessation tool that we've been waiting for?\"\u00a0 And I don't think we have enough science to say clearly that they are.\u00a0 But I do think that they are interesting enough that they merit strong scientific inquiry to see if they are in fact safe and effective tools for smoking cessation.\u00a0 What we don't want with e-cigarettes is for people to start using the e-cigarettes and then end up using both e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, a situation we call a dual use.\u00a0 That has happened in some populations.\u00a0 But the only way to know if this works or not is to study it rigorously.\u00a0 And I think that's something that we should do.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to back you up back to nutrition because we have a Twitter question.\u00a0 \"Why do doctors receive so little training in diet and nutrition when plant-based diets are scientifically shown to prevent and improve heart disease and diabetes?\"</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So that's a great question.\u00a0 And, in fact, I will tell you what my nutrition education was in medical school.\u00a0 My nutrition education consisted of an eight-week class that was offered once a week in the evening, and it was optional.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] So how many people do you think went to that class?\u00a0 There were about six of us, I think, in the class.\u00a0 One of them was the instructor, so not a whole lot of people.\u00a0 So traditionally this has been a huge gap in medicine that we have-there are actually several gaps in traditional medical training.\u00a0 One is around nutrition.\u00a0 Another is actually around emotional health and well-being, which has a profound impact on our health but which we don't really talk about very much in medical school.\u00a0 In fact, I'll say this parenthetically, that the power and impact of emotional health and well-being is so profound on our health-and something I saw so clearly again and again when I was in office-that I decided coming out of office that what we needed to do was to really shift our culture and understanding around emotions so that we could understand the role it played in health, but also invest in cultivating positive emotions and teaching children how to regulate their emotions.</p><p>And what we see when you do that is that not only can you actually reduce rates of addiction, a major problem right now, but you can also reduce rates of violence; you can reduce incarceration rates; you can improve graduation rates and grades; you can reduce teen pregnancies.\u00a0 So the power of investing in emotional well-being is actually quite extraordinary but has been barely tapped.\u00a0 And that's why coming out of office I am working now with some colleagues to build an institute on emotional health and well-being that will help make that journey for us from a place where we largely ignore emotions to one where we harness them to improve our health.</p><p>But part of what we need to change in medicine around nutrition is education.\u00a0 And that's slowly happening.\u00a0 But I don't think we can wait for medicine to get fully on board with training its clinicians to understand how best to deal with nutrition in the clinic.\u00a0 I do think what we need in addition to training doctors is we need public health strategies around nutrition.\u00a0 We talked about a couple of them, working, for example, with manufacturers to reduce sodium and sugar content.\u00a0 But what we also need to do is think about the availability of healthy foods and beverages in our communities.\u00a0 We know, for example, that accessibility, whether in terms of both affordability but also in terms of location, is paramount to people's choices.</p><p>If you work in an office building that doesn't have restaurants around it but that has an office cafeteria, the food that's in that office cafeteria is going to have an impact on the choices that you make.\u00a0 And if there are healthy options, then you are more likely to make them.\u00a0 The Department of Defense-I had the chance to work with them when I was in office as part of the National Prevention Council of which I chaired, which was the council set up by the Affordable Care Act which brings together the secretaries of all the major federal agencies to think about how their policies impact prevention.\u00a0 And one of the things the Department of Defense was doing was actually experimenting with looking at their own cafeterias on bases.\u00a0 And what they found is we needed simple things like change the location of the grill and the salad bar to bring the salad bar closer to the front of the cafeteria.\u00a0 You could have a significant increase, in fact, on people's choice of healthier foods.</p><p>So these types of population-based strategies, I think, are essential for us to take now if we want to affect as large a number of people as quickly as possible.\u00a0 Working with physicians and training nurses to have conversations with patients in clinics and hospitals is important, but I don't think it's going to happen quickly enough for us to ultimately get to where we need to be, which is a place where people can make healthy choices at affordable rates and ultimately live healthier lives.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gotcha.\u00a0 I've left us about five minutes for the opioid epidemic.\u00a0 I see some glimmers of hope after covering this for three years.\u00a0 Prescriptions are down.\u00a0 Members of congress are introducing dozens of bills to finally address the kinds of things that you have been speaking about and others have been speaking about.\u00a0 That has absolutely nothing to do with the upcoming midterm elections, of course.\u00a0 But overdoses will probably rise again in 2017 when we get the data, particularly from fentanyl.\u00a0 So can you tell us where are we right now in the opioid epidemic, and what do you see going forward?</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, you know, the opioid epidemic is on so many levels heart breaking.\u00a0 I first started to see the impact of it when I was practicing medicine up in Boston and realizing that more and more patients were coming in struggling with addiction to opioids.\u00a0 And realizing that as doctors we had not been well trained in how to think about pain, how to address pain, and how to address addiction, save for addiction-medicine specialists who are too few in number.</p><p>But the tragedy of opioids also is that it's revealing something deeper that we are dealing with, which is not just a problem with prescribing but, as I came to see in communities all across the country, there is a deeper pain that people are experiencing, a deeper despair in their lives that is often being fed or temporarily assuaged by not just opioids but by alcohol and by other substances that can easily be misused.\u00a0 And so if we ultimately want to address the opioid epidemic, we do need to change prescribing practices; we do need to expand the access to treatment; we do need to get naloxone in the hands of not just first responders but family members; but we also need to think more deeply about the root causes of addiction.</p><p>You know, addiction in many ways is as much a social disease as it is a biological disease.\u00a0 And what I mean by that is that while addiction impacts us on a biological level affecting our prefrontal cortex, affecting our extended amygdala, affecting our basal ganglia, all areas which are related to our ability to deal with stress and rewards and to control decisions and such, while all of that is true, we also are increasingly realizing that the social context of our lives, whether we are fulfilled, whether we have meaning, whether we have social connection with others, also plays a role in our experience of and our likelihood of developing addiction.\u00a0 So I think that we have to really understand this in order to build a comprehensive strategy.</p><p>I think where we are now is in a place where overdose deaths are still not decreasing, so we have a lot of reason to worry.\u00a0 But that does not mean that we are not making progress.\u00a0 So we are, for example, reducing prescriptions of opioids, which is important.\u00a0 We, in fact, have seen a near 25% reduction from the peak of opioid prescribing.\u00a0 It's still far above where it was in 1999, so we have a ways to go.\u00a0 Where we're also seeing progress is in extending medication-assisted treatment, which is evidence-based treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, extending that to people who actually need it.\u00a0 There are still far too many people who need treatment and can't get it, held back in part not just by funding but also by a terrible stigma around medication-assisted treatment.\u00a0 But in places like Rhode Island, for example, we are seeing that the state has now moved to make medication assisted treatment available in the prison system.\u00a0 And what that has allowed is for more people who need treatment to get it and a reduction in overdose deaths by nearly 12% statewide in Rhode Island in just a year's time.\u00a0 We're also seeing in cities like Baltimore and others where naloxone is made readily available to first responders and to the public that overdose deaths, in fact-or the people have been able to save a growing number of lives with the use of naloxone.\u00a0 And so I think there is reason to be hopeful that some of these strategies are working.</p><p>But here are a couple of things I think we have to do if we really want to accelerate this movement.\u00a0 Number one is we have to invest in these upstream prevention programs.\u00a0 By upstream prevention, what do I mean?\u00a0 I don't mean just changing prescribing; I don't' mean just patient education about opioids.\u00a0 I mean investing in the many programs that we wrote about in chapter three of \"The Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health,\" programs which are often school- and community-based, which are relatively inexpensive to administer, but which can have a dramatic impact on drug use among children, adolescents, and among adults.\u00a0 Some of these programs like the good behavior games program, for example, for every $1 you invest in it, you see a $64 reduction in healthcare cost, criminal justice cost, and loss of economic productivity.</p><p>There are other programs like that too; the life skills program; the Nurse-Family Partnership.\u00a0 But we have invested so little in those programs, despite how much they can return.\u00a0 And I think part of the reason we've done that is partly not enough people know about them in terms of policy makers, but there is also a mentality that we want to invest in something today that's going to have a result tomorrow.\u00a0 But we need to play both the short and the long game when it comes to opioids, and that means investing up front.</p><p>But the last thing I'll say on this in terms of what we have to do is that we also need to think about what's the appropriate role that each of us has to play here.\u00a0 This is not a problem-opioids-that the government is going to solve on its own.\u00a0 We need people in the private sector, individuals, and communities to help step up and help us shift the culture around addiction, which still tells us that this is a disease entirely of choice, that this is evidence of a character flaw or a moral failing.\u00a0 And that is not the case.\u00a0 You know, addiction is a disease of the brain.\u00a0 It's a social disease as well that many of us could be a victim to and may already be a victim to.\u00a0 And it's really often just dependent on the circumstances in which we live.</p><p>So we have to remember that we each have the power to change culture when it comes to addiction.\u00a0 And if we can change culture, then we can change a lot of other things.\u00a0 We can make it easier for communities to accept medication-assisted treatment facilities.\u00a0 We can increase the pressure on elected leaders to invest in expanding treatment for the opioid epidemic.\u00a0 But this is what we have to do.\u00a0 And government, the role that they need to-the federal government, I think, can and needs to play now is a role in setting a clear vision and benchmark of where we need to go on opioids.\u00a0 How much, for example, are we trying to reduce opioid overdose deaths in the next one year or five years?\u00a0 I don't think that that has been stated clearly.\u00a0 How are we holding states and the federal government accountable also for doing the work that needs to be done on opioids, not just for passing bills but responsible for changing outcomes?\u00a0 You know, I care less about a bill that's passed; I care more about an outcome that's achieved.\u00a0 And we might say that the bill is a way to, the method to achieving the outcome, but that's only a possibility; it doesn't mean it's going to happen unless we hold our elected leaders accountable to those outcomes.</p><p>So this is a place where I think government has a unique role to play.\u00a0 There is not private company that can set up and set a goal for the United States in terms of how much we should be reducing opioid overdose deaths in the next five years or 10 years; that is a place where I think the government has to step up.\u00a0 So, yeah. \u00a0So I was really privileged to work on this issue though when I was in office, because I do think that at the root of the opioid epidemic are deeper questions that we have to ask about society.\u00a0 What kind of society do we want to live in?\u00a0 Do we want to live in a society where we believe every life truly matters?\u00a0 Do we want to live in a society where we all chip in, recognizing that we are vulnerable in some way, whether it's to addiction or loneliness or other conditions, and that we are stronger when we come together, when we recognize our interdependence, and when we help each other?\u00a0 As tragic as the opioid epidemic is, if it can move us in a direction of shared understanding about our interdependence, if it can help us address these deeper social roots of disease, then I believe that we will have used it ultimately to improve ourselves to become stronger as a country.</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much, Dr. Murthy.\u00a0 You gave us a lot to think about in just a half an hour.\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>Murthy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>Bernstein:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We're going to turn it over now to my colleague Paige Winfield Cunningham for the final discussion today with CMS administrator Seema Verma.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>          One-on-One with Seema Verma, Administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services:       </p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I'm Paige Winfield Cunningham, health policy reporter and author of the Health 202 newsletter here at The Washington Post.\u00a0 And I'm pleased to welcome my guest, Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and she's here to outline her vision for the Medicaid program, which covers around 70 million Americans and of course, is a very integral part in America's healthcare future.\u00a0 So let's welcome the administrator.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>I want to remind our audience in the room and those watching online that you can tweet us your questions using the #PostLive and I will pose some of them to the administrator later on in our discussion.\u00a0 Before we get started, I actually wanted to ask you a mom-to-mom question, if that's okay?\u00a0 [LAUGHS]</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Okay.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 So I understand you have two kids, a daughter and a son, and one of them is graduating from high school this week?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Yes, this week, so it's been a big week for all of us at HHS.\u00a0 It's not only drug pricing, but it's graduation for my daughter and for Secretary Azar.\u00a0 They both go to the same school and so we're excited.\u00a0 Big week.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 That's great.\u00a0 I have two little ones of my own and one on the way.\u00a0 So here's what I wanted to know: Do you give your kids waivers to get them to help with work around the house?\u00a0 [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Everybody's working and there are no waivers.\u00a0 You just do your job.\u00a0 [LAUGHS]</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Good to know.\u00a0 All right, so speaking of work requirements, let's start with that because as you know, it's probably the buzziest topic around Medicaid these days.\u00a0 You so far have approved the community engagement requirements in four states and a half-dozen others have applied as well.\u00a0 I want to know what metrics are you going to use to determine whether these new requirements are a success or a failure.</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Let me talk about community engagement at large.\u00a0 So these efforts really were borne out of some of the changes to the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 The Medicaid program traditionally has been one that has served the aged, blind, people living with disabilities, pregnant women, and children.\u00a0 And with the Affordable Care Act, we added all of these new able-bodied individuals to the Medicaid program and so I think states were looking at this saying, \"We don't want to just give people a card or just health insurance,\" but we want to try to help the needs of this population.\u00a0 These are individuals that are living at the poverty level-at or near the poverty level and so what can we do to help them?\u00a0 Not just getting healthcare coverage, but finding a pathway out of poverty, a bridge to independence.</p><p>And so our efforts were really as a response to where the states were in terms of wanting to do more for this population.\u00a0 And so what we did earlier this year is we put out guidance for states about how they could structure what we call \"community engagement\".\u00a0 And Community engagement isn't necessarily just about work.\u00a0 It could be volunteer work, it could be job search activities.\u00a0 It could be job training.\u00a0 Anything to sort of help that individual seek independence and a pathway out of poverty.\u00a0 And the other thing we did in the guidance is we also put some guidelines around what may or may not work.\u00a0 We know that a community engagement requirement may not apply to all populations.\u00a0 So this is focused on able-bodied individuals.\u00a0 It does not apply to people living with disabilities or pregnant moms or kids, obviously.\u00a0 It's just focused on those groups of individuals.</p><p>And within that, we also asked states to think about what types of exemption would be appropriate.\u00a0 So there are some individuals that are facing acute medical conditions, they're medically frail and community engagement might not be appropriate for them.\u00a0 Or there's individuals that are dealing with substance abuse disorder, opioid addiction.\u00a0 So creating exemptions for those individuals as well or they may be living in areas where they may not be jobs available.\u00a0 There may be problems with the economy in that particular area.\u00a0 So to think about how could they create exemptions.\u00a0 So we put these guardrails around the program.</p><p>The response we've received has been very positive and when you look at community engagement from a polling perspective, there's a lot of public support for these types of programs.\u00a0 There was also a survey of physicians that was also done that showed high support for this as well.\u00a0 One of the things that we're doing with all of our programs that Medicaid is-we're trying to give states as much flexibility as possible.\u00a0 And with that flexibility also comes some accountability.\u00a0 So we're going to have very strong evaluations of these programs.\u00a0 And really, the purpose of them is to improve health outcomes and so as part of the evaluation and your question, which is, \"How are we going to look at these programs and what types of indicators?\"\u00a0 We're going to look at health outcomes.\u00a0 The research shows that there is a strong link between people that are working and better health outcomes.\u00a0 So that's one of the things we're going to look at and we're going to look at individuals who are on the program and how many of them actually participate in the requirement, how many of them actually go on to getting a job and being independent of the program.\u00a0 So there's a lot of different parameters that we're going to be looking at.\u00a0 But it's all centered around improving health outcomes.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 There have been some concerns expressed about sort of a difficulty in implementing these kinds of requirements and that's something I know that the Medicaid plans themselves have expressed to me.\u00a0 Are there ways that you can help them to put these new requirements in place?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I think anytime you start something new, there's going to be some challenges, just understanding the best way to do this, but as I've toured the country and talked to a lot of states-I was actually in Arkansas when their waiver was granted, and we heard some remarkable ideas that they have going on, on the state level.\u00a0 For example, they had been working on a partnership with some of the nursing homes that said, \"We need individuals to help the certified nurse assistants or we need aides.\"\u00a0 And they actually had a lack of these types of employees.\u00a0 So they were going to run free training programs and they were really kind of building that partnership with the state.\u00a0 They were also working with their community colleges and granting scholarships to some of the individuals that are on Medicaid that were participating in the community engagement requirement.\u00a0 So I think every state is going to approach this differently, but I think it's exciting to see the type of discussion and collaboration on the community level.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 I want to ask you about some of the other kinds of Medicaid flexibility states have been requesting, but first, let me step back for a minute with a broader question, and that is: How do you want the Medicaid program to look different overall when you eventually leave CMS compared to when you started last year?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think the Medicaid program, like I said, is a promise to the most vulnerable populations in our society.\u00a0 So I want to make sure that our programs are delivering high-quality, accessible healthcare.\u00a0 That we are improving health outcomes, that we are helping each and every individual that's on the program achieve the best quality of life and that we are helping each of those individuals attain their highest level of potential.\u00a0 And while doing that, we also want to make sure we're improving health outcomes and finally, making sure that the program is sustainable-sustainable over the long term.</p><p>If we look at the Medicaid program, this is the number one or number two budget item in most states and it's starting to crowd out other priorities for the states.\u00a0 It's education, it's infrastructure, it's job creation.\u00a0 And so there's been a lot of discussion about the Medicaid program and its financing.\u00a0 And just a little bit of history: If we look back at the program, in 1985, states were spending about 10% of their budget on the Medicaid program.\u00a0 And if you fast forward just a few years ago, it's almost a third of their budgets.\u00a0 And so the program originally started as a federal-state partnership where the federal government and the state were contributing towards the costs.\u00a0 Well, what's happened over time is that states have increased their spending more and more, and with that increased spending came more federal oversight.\u00a0 So more oversight, more regulation.\u00a0 And what we have now, in the end, is what I would say is more of a one-size-fits-all approach, where the federal government is basically dictating to states how they run their programs.\u00a0 And obviously, that's understandable because of the spending.\u00a0 But I hope to get us to a place where we can agree to what we're going to spend on the program and then provide a new era of flexibility for states.</p><p>In my personal experience, I worked with the Medicaid program for many years, and before I came to CMS, my job was to work with states, help them design innovative programs and then work with CMS.\u00a0 And one of the biggest barriers to creating flexible programs, innovative programs to help achieve better health outcomes was quite frankly, CMS.\u00a0 CMS was the biggest barrier towards delivering innovation.\u00a0 And so I hope to get to a new era where states are driving their programs and they're deciding what's going to work best in their communities because they're closer to the people that they serve and that we can hold states accountable.\u00a0 So we're going to give them flexibility but hold them accountable for shaping outcomes and so we can actually measure what they're doing.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 What's your vision, though, for enrollment overall on Medicaid?\u00a0 And I've just been curious about this because your critics like to say, \"Well, they just want to rollback enrollment, reduce enrollment.\"\u00a0 Conservatives often would argue, \"Well, that's a good thing because ultimately, you want to get people off of these kinds of programs.\"\u00a0 So as I had mentioned earlier, it covers around 70 million Americans now, which is a lot of people.\u00a0 Where would you like to see that number go?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think as I said before, my goals are about delivering high-quality care and improving outcomes for the individuals on the program.\u00a0 When I look at the Medicaid program, I think of it almost in terms of two Medicaid programs.\u00a0 There's the program that serves the most fragile, vulnerable populations in our society.\u00a0 These could be people that are living on ventilators or quadriplegics.\u00a0 That's a very different program than looking at the program for the able-bodied individuals.\u00a0 So the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, expanded it to those individuals-to able-bodied individuals and so I think it's a different type of program and we need a different response.\u00a0 For those individuals, the goal should be helping them not only to provide healthcare coverage but helping them with a pathway out of poverty.\u00a0 It's much easier to just hand a card and say, \"Good luck to you.\u00a0 Go get your healthcare.\"\u00a0 It's a much harder thing and a much higher goal that we have to actually help these individuals live independent lives.</p><p>And so it is success for us when somebody is able to rise out of poverty and no longer need the program for those able-bodied individuals.\u00a0 If they are able to get a job that provides health insurance and create that independence, I consider that a success.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 So we've talked about the work requirements but a couple of other things that states have requested.\u00a0 I think the next thing we've all waiting on is Wisconsin's request for drug testing.\u00a0 How are you evaluating their request and thinking about that?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So we look at any state's proposal.\u00a0 It's kind of thinking about, \"What is it that they want to achieve?\"\u00a0 Obviously, our nation is in the middle of an opioid epidemic.\u00a0 The president has asked Health and Human Services to declare that a public health emergency so we're very focused on developing strategies to try to address the epidemic.\u00a0 So when we look at some of the things that states want to do, it's understanding where is it that you want to go and what goals do you want to achieve?\u00a0 For a lot of states, what they're looking at is they want to be able to identify individuals that need help and we've got to figure out what's the best way to identify those individuals and then help link them to the services that are going to be most appropriate.\u00a0 Because states are trying to do something about the opioid epidemic.</p><p>So as we're looking at what's the best way to accomplish that and there's many ways to address that.\u00a0 States could come up with ideas around doing a risk assessment and not only identifying issues around substance abuse, opioid use but also looking at a comprehensive health assessment to look at all of the types of health issues that a person may be facing.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 And then recently you drew a line for how far you're willing to go with flexibility in Medicaid by rejecting Kansas's request for lifetime limits for three years, I believe.\u00a0 But do you see any scenarios under which you might approve less strict lifetime limits?\u00a0 I know there are a couple other states with similar requests.\u00a0 I think Arizona and Utah have asked for a five-year type of limit.\u00a0 How are you evaluating those requests?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I think in the case of Kansas-let me just say that's a wonderful state where they've done terrific things with their Medicaid program.\u00a0 They're very innovative.\u00a0 When we put out the guidance around community engagement, what we talked about was making sure that states were aligning with their SNAP and TANF programs because those programs also have community engagement requirements and we didn't want individuals to have two sets of requirements.\u00a0 So if they were in SNAP or TANF, we didn't want them to have a different set of guidelines on Medicaid.\u00a0 I think that created a little bit of confusion for states.\u00a0 In the SNAP and TANF program, if an individual is in the program for about three years and after, depending on a certain amount of time.\u00a0 And afterward, they have to engage in community engagement to retain those benefits.</p><p>And we're comfortable with that approach.\u00a0 What we understand about the Medicaid program is you're dealing with a fragile population and their changes in their lives.\u00a0 So they may be able to go into a community engagement program, get a job, they're independent.\u00a0 But circumstances change, and we always want to make sure that the program serves as a safety net and there's a place for people to go when they need it.\u00a0 What we have approved or what we'd say temporary lapses in coverage.\u00a0 So an individual may not comply with a requirement around cost-sharing and they could potentially lose coverage.\u00a0 But we want to make sure that there's a pathway back into the program, that there's a way for them to come back in if they're compliant with the requirements.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 So does that mean pretty much a no from you guys on lifetime limits?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, we've indicated that we would not approve lifetime limits and I think we've made that pretty clear to states.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 So let's talk about Medicaid expansion for a minute.\u00a0 It's been eight years since the ACA was passed.\u00a0 Hard to believe sometimes.\u00a0 Nineteen states, I believe, have not expanded Medicaid, leaving about 2.4 million people in this coverage gap where they can't get Medicaid but then are ineligible for the marketplace subsidies.\u00a0 Do you feel like the remaining states should expand Medicaid, and if they don't, what should be done for these people in the coverage gap?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So a couple of things.\u00a0 Our whole philosophy has been supporting states in where they want to go and what they want to do.\u00a0 We're not trying to push states any which way on this particular issue.\u00a0 If a state comes to us with a state plan amendment request, under the law, we're required to process that application and we're going to do so accordingly.\u00a0 At the same time, we're not going to do the types of things that the previous administration did in trying to strong-arm and force states into expansion.\u00a0 We saw examples where they had existing programs, or they tried to reduce funding in other areas, trying to be coercive with states and try to push them into expansion and we're definitely not doing that.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 One approach that has been raised is partial Medicaid expansion, like in Utah and I believe that's something the prior administration had rejected.\u00a0 So Utah wants to cover people up to 100% of federal poverty.\u00a0 Can you give us any insights into your thinking about that type of approach?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So we're continuing to look at that issue.\u00a0 I think we've had a few states and we're continuing to look at the policy issues around that and what the implications are.\u00a0 If they're doing partial expansion, that means they're coming to the exchanges and so we're trying to understand all of the implications and the scenarios and what the impact would be.\u00a0 One of the things that we do when we're looking at waivers, and usually the states are coming to us when they have a waiver request.\u00a0 And what that essentially means is they're asking us to waive regulations or waive laws and they're usually doing that because they want to create an innovative program.\u00a0 So when we look at the parameters around how we approve waivers, we're looking at that in terms of what's the impact going to be on the federal budget.\u00a0 That's a big issue, a big threshold question.</p><p>We're also looking at what we can waive under the law, what is actually permissible, and then the third area is it consistent with the objectives of the Medicaid program.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday, both you and Secretary Azar mentioned you'll be rolling out some updates to the Medicare and Medicaid drug pricing dashboards and the Health 202 had sort of a sneak peek this morning of that.\u00a0 Can you share some details about what new data you're adding and why you think that will make these more useful?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 So one of the things that we've talked about at the agency from the time we got there is that we want this to be about patients first and so much of the decision-making and policy, we're always thinking about the patients.\u00a0 So from my perspective, we want to empower patients with the information that they need to make the decisions that are going to work best for them and their families.\u00a0 So we want to empower patients with information about costs, information about quality, and also, make sure that they have their health records at their disposal.\u00a0 So you kind of hear us talking about that and there's a variety of initiatives around those lines.\u00a0 And so we've had a drug pricing dashboard that's been at the agency for a little while, but we've made some updates to this dashboard.\u00a0 So in the past, which you could gather from this dashboard is you can see essentially what the Medicare program, Medicaid programs had been spending.\u00a0 But we've revised this dashboard and it's available for the first time today.</p><p>And this time, you'll actually be able to see the prices.\u00a0 You can see for every drug in Medicaid and Medicare what the prices are and you can also see for the first time, the year-over-year price increases.\u00a0 So you'll be able to see whether there's been a double-digit increase or a triple-digit increase.\u00a0 Or in some cases, a quadruple-digit increase.\u00a0 So all of that information is available as of today.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Who are you aiming at with this dashboard?\u00a0 Who do you want to use it?\u00a0 Just health policy folks mostly or more of consumers?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think it can be everybody, but essentially, our philosophy has been around patients first and we want to make sure that patients have that information.\u00a0 So our goal is to focus on patients, but I think it could be used by a variety of different individuals.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 So let's talk a little bit more about the president's drug proposal.\u00a0 There's been a lot of attention paid to the ideas around Medicare and there's a lot in there.\u00a0 But it also includes a few suggestions about Medicaid and a lot of this is quite cryptic so hopefully, you can help us kind of understand some of these ideas.\u00a0 But one that I noticed is allowing five states to experiment with behaving more like commercial health plans by letting them limit drug formularies and then negotiate prices with manufacturers.\u00a0 Can you talk a little bit about that idea and how promising you see it?\u00a0\u00a0 I know that Massachusetts has also requested a waiver along these lines.</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Concerning the issue with drug pricing, there's been a lot of attention, obviously, on Medicare.\u00a0 But for Medicaid and for states, it's a big issue there as well.\u00a0 And just a little bit of background on how the Medicaid program works with drug pricing.\u00a0 So there guarantees a certain level of discounts and that depends on whether it's a brand or generic.\u00a0 And then that level of discount changes depending on how the manufacturer has priced their products.\u00a0 So if they have increased that price beyond normal inflation, then they're going to be giving additional discounts.\u00a0 So what happened with the Affordable Care Act is they actually put a cap on that.\u00a0 So essentially, they put a cap on the penalties that these manufacturers would face.\u00a0 So essentially eliminating any incentive for manufacturers to keep prices lower and actually the reverse.</p><p>And what we've seen is over 2,300 drugs, actually, the prices had gone up when they made this change in the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 So that's definitely been an issue for states.\u00a0 But one of the issues that states face is that they are able to get a lot of discounts and it works really well when there is a number of competitors because they're competing to have better placement on a state's formulary.\u00a0 But I think the issue for states that has been more problematic is that when there are new drugs available, new drugs that don't have competitors.\u00a0 And I think the best example of this when some of the new drugs around hepatitis came out.\u00a0 And we saw some very, very high price tags and for states, they're not prepared for this.\u00a0 They're on a one-year or a two-year budget cycle and so all of a sudden, they have these major costs to pay for and they're not prepared for it.</p><p>And so one of the things that we've been talking about with states is for drugs in this particular category-new, high-cost drugs with no competitors-is thinking about modernizing how we pay for medication.\u00a0 Not only in Medicare, but also in Medicaid.\u00a0 Thinking about tools like value-based pricing and this is something that we've seen some experimentation going on in the private market and bringing some of that innovation to our Medicare and Medicaid programs.\u00a0 And what this essentially means is thinking about paying for drugs on the basis of the outcomes that it achieves.\u00a0 So maybe paying for the drug over time, depending on whether it's actually delivering results.\u00a0 It could be based on, \"Is this drug able to impact the total cost of care?\u00a0 Is it able to actually lower our spending overall?\"\u00a0 So we're looking at some ways and working with states.</p><p>And we'll continue to look at the formulary issue.\u00a0 At this point, I can't comment on any particular state, but that's our overall strategy with states is kind of thinking about new ways of paying for high-cost drugs.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 But you guys could go ahead with this five-state demonstration?\u00a0 Is that correct?\u00a0 Is that something you're actually pursuing?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's exactly-we want to make sure that states have flexibility.\u00a0 I think the complicating factor is that right now, states do get these guaranteed discounts that I talked about and they get these guaranteed discounts because they're required to make available every drug that the FDA approves.\u00a0 And so we need to think about if we're giving them flexibility, are they also able to get these discounts?</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I also did want to ask you-I'm glad you brought up the best-price law.\u00a0 Because your colleague, FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has suggested that that actually could leave consumers worse off by encouraging drug makers to raise the list prices.\u00a0 And do you agree with that?\u00a0 Do you think that best prices discounts artificially drive list prices higher and is that something that should be explored for changes?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think that the pharmaceutical industry has given us great innovation, not only to the United States, but to the entire world.\u00a0 But innovation really doesn't mean anything if you can't afford your medications.\u00a0 And I think what my colleague Scott is referring to is the whole system of pricing is based on rebates.\u00a0 And it's a convoluted system with the idea of a middleman that's negotiating rebates from the manufacturers.\u00a0 But the middleman, PBM is basically negotiating not only with the drug manufacturers but they're also getting money from plans.\u00a0 And it's just a convoluted system where the middle man is getting money from both sides.\u00a0 And so what we've started to think about is we want to create incentives for manufacturers to lower their list price.\u00a0 Essentially, what I think the blueprint talked about is thinking about whether our system should be based on list price instead of these rebates.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 What excites you the most in the president's drug proposal?\u00a0 I know that Secretary Azar was asked this question yesterday and he said that this idea of bringing more Medicare Part B drugs under Part D-to him, that was one of the biggest things.\u00a0 But what do you see as like potentially the most significant in helping to reduce drug spending?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, I'm very proud and honored to serve with this team.\u00a0 I think the president's leadership on this issue has been tremendous.\u00a0 As long as I've known him, in every conversation that I've had with him, he always talks about drug pricing.\u00a0 It's a high priority for him and I think the steps that we're taking and what was outlined in the blueprint is quite frankly, very historic.\u00a0 No other president has put together a plan like this.\u00a0 There are a lot of different elements in that plan and they really are structured around a few different areas.\u00a0 The first one is increasing competition and on the issue that you brought up with the Part B plan and Part D is that a lot of times, we don't have competition.\u00a0 We've got some new high-cost drugs, which is why FDA is trying to increase the time to bring generics and other competitors.\u00a0 So that's one piece is increasing competition.\u00a0 And we know that within the Medicare program, there are some drugs that are in the Part B program, but the competitor is in Part D and so we're trying to figure out ways of bringing those programs together or looking at how we could create some of the things that we've done in Part D and Part B to create an environment of competition.\u00a0 Because we know when we have competition, that's going to lower prices.</p><p>And then we're also looking at the area of negotiation.\u00a0 If we create a more competitive environment, we want to give new tools to the PBMs, give them the types of innovative tools that are going on in the private market to negotiate better prices.\u00a0 And then the third area is what we talked about before is creating incentives for pharmaceutical companies to lower their list prices.\u00a0 And that has to do it looking at the entire rebate system.\u00a0 The whole way the rebate system works is around actually encouraging higher prices because the higher the list price is-because all of the rebates are based on a percentage of that list price.\u00a0 And so the higher the list price, that means the higher the rebates, there's a higher cut that all the middlemen get.\u00a0 And then, unfortunately for patients, that means that they're paying more out-of-pocket expenses because their out-of-pocket expenses are based on the list price.</p><p>There are so many different things that I think we have in the blueprint, but I'm excited because I think it provides a real opportunity to lower prices for all Americans.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 One of the criticisms, though, that I've been hearing a lot over the last couple of days is this is a huge list of ideas and they would sort of tweak things around the edges, but that there's nothing that's going to directly get at the price of drugs.\u00a0 How do you respond to those criticisms?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, this has been a priority from day one and so we've already done some things to lower list prices.\u00a0 We made some changes in our hospital program, a 340B program, where we knew that hospitals were getting discounts, but they weren't passing those onto our seniors.\u00a0 Essentially, overcharging them.\u00a0 We already made that change this year.\u00a0 Seniors are going to save $320 million just this year.\u00a0 We also made some changes to the Part D program, so that when generics become available, that our seniors have immediate access to that.\u00a0 They don't have to wait a whole year and that means that they're going to pay lower prices.\u00a0 So we've already made some changes that seniors are starting to feel that are going to lower prices.\u00a0 And I think what we've outlined in a number of different steps, whether it's the changes to Part D, whether it's addressing the incentives, all of those things are going to work together.\u00a0 It's not going to be a one-shot and we're done.\u00a0 But we've been working on it over the past year and we're going to continue to do that.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 This has been a great discussion about coverage for the low income, but for a minute, I did want to touch on coverage for the 10 million or so Americans that get their coverage through the marketplaces.\u00a0 And, of course, I've written a lot.\u00a0 My colleagues have written a lot about your pursuit of short-term and association health plans, which you say would provide people cheaper, leaner insurance options.\u00a0 But do you have any worries that this will end up drawing the healthier consumers out of the marketplaces and essentially leave behind a high-risk pool?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think we look at the Affordable Care Act and the impact that it's had.\u00a0 At this point, we are at triple-digit increases.\u00a0 Prices have gone up over 100% since the Affordable Care Act started and with these higher prices, what we're seeing is higher deductibles.\u00a0 A lot of folks can't even afford the plans that they have.\u00a0 We have states that only have one choice of health plan and we've got 50% of our counties that only have one plan.\u00a0 So we're paying more and we're getting less choices.</p><p>We also, because the costs have gone up so much, there's a lot of individuals that can't afford any coverage.\u00a0 If they're not getting a subsidy, they have no way of getting coverage.\u00a0 And with these states where there's only one cover, one insurer, or counties where there's one insurer, those prices are going to continue to go up because we've created virtual monopolies.\u00a0 So what the short-term limited duration plans are about are giving people another choice, giving them an option.\u00a0 Because a lot of times, it's a choice between no coverage at all or a type of short-term limited duration plan that potentially, could be a lifeline for people that are facing having no coverage at all.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 But then are people in the marketplaces left then with higher premiums than ever before?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I think we're assessing the impact.\u00a0 I think some of the actuarial studies show that the impact is not that high.\u00a0 Our concern is for the millions of Americans that have no place because they cannot afford any coverage at all.\u00a0 Unfortunately, we're in a difficult situation because Congress has not addressed the issues with the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0 At the end of the day, we need a comprehensive solution and this administration has been about trying to address the problems, repeal and replace.\u00a0 Because we know that it's just not working.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 To kind of end with a broad question here-we saw some pretty significant gains in lowering the uninsured rate in the years right after the ACA's provisions went into effect and lately, we've learned that the uninsured rate is creeping back up.\u00a0 In fact, it's back up to 12.2%, which is much higher than most other developed countries.\u00a0 Are you worried this trajectory is going to continue and how can it be prevented?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I think that it is going to continue because as I said before, prices are going up with Obamacare.\u00a0 We've had some states that have had 200% increases.\u00a0 And so while many people are subsidized, you're now creating a new pool of individuals that they can't afford coverage.\u00a0 We've heard horror stories from folks where they were paying a couple hundred dollars a month for their healthcare coverage and then after the Affordable Care Act, they're now paying $900 or $1,000 and they've seen the prices go up dramatically.\u00a0 And at some point, people can't afford coverage.</p><p>And so that's why you're seeing the number of uninsured go up and I would anticipate if we do not have changes at the federal level-and Congress needs to make changes-we're going to see the number of uninsured go up.\u00a0 And that's why I think the president has acted.\u00a0 That's why you saw the executive around short-term limited duration plans and association plans because that's supposed to give at least an option for individuals that are facing being uninsured because the costs are so high.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Do you hold out any hope still that Congress is going to act on this?\u00a0 We all saw sort of the meltdown last year in effort after effort and it seems quite unlikely now.\u00a0 But how do you view that situation?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm always going to remain hopeful because we look at the damage that Obamacare is doing to so many Americans.\u00a0 We're seeing these price hikes.\u00a0 We're seeing lack of choices and so we're very hopeful.\u00a0 In the meantime, what we've tried to do is focus on what we can do from a regulatory level.\u00a0 We made changes with our payment notice that came out last year to give more flexibility for states so that they can regulate their markets, giving them new tools that we hope will lower prices and create more choices for states.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Can I ask you one last real wonky question?\u00a0 This practice of silver loading, you I believe referred to it in the big marketplace rule that you released in April, but is this something that you're going to continue allowing insurers to do next year?\u00a0 As our audience probably knows, this was a practice by insurers, which basically meant that consumers could get more generous subsidies in the marketplaces because the silver plan rates were increased.\u00a0 But can you give us any insight into that?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, we continue to look at this.\u00a0 I think generally, with the Affordable Care Act, it seems like any move that you make, it's a difficult issue because the underlying structure of Obamacare just isn't working.\u00a0 So you make one move in one area, try to help one group and it's going to have an impact.\u00a0 So we're continuing to look at the impact of silver loading as well as a lot of different things that are going on in the market.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Okay, and any final thoughts on kind of what you would like to look back on as sort of your biggest accomplishment when you end up leaving CMS in the future?</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think that's the problem.\u00a0 I have a long list of things because I think our healthcare system is moving in a concerning direction.\u00a0 From a broad perspective, we have a lot of exciting technology and innovation and new treatments and therapies and we want to make sure that we're delivering high-quality healthcare to our beneficiaries.\u00a0 But we also understand the large role we play and the footprint that we have in the entire industry.\u00a0 Recently, our actuaries released a report talked about where the cost of healthcare is going and that by 2026, it will be one in every $5.\u00a0 And that's something that keeps me up at night.\u00a0 We really need to do something about bending the cost curve, while at the same time, delivering on giving people innovative therapies.\u00a0 So building some efficiencies in the system.\u00a0 We also want to work into a new era of what I would say \"patient empowerment\".</p><p>We've had so much discussion over the years about how to lower prices and for everything that we've done-we've increased regulation, we've regulated everybody.\u00a0 Thousands of pages of regulations.\u00a0 We have a new healthcare law that was supposed to provide coverage to all of these individuals, but it didn't do anything about the underlying drivers of healthcare costs.\u00a0 And so after all of that, we haven't done anything to do lower the costs of healthcare or the rate of growth.\u00a0 And I think that's a goal, not only for CMS, but hopefully, for the entire nation.\u00a0 Because we're on an unsustainable trajectory.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today.\u00a0 I'd like to thank Administrator Verma for joining us.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE]</p><p>Verma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>Cunningham:\u00a0\u00a0 And if you'd like to watch

Ford Presidential Museum</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>Washington: U.S Department of Justice has issued the following news release:</p><p>Thank you very much, Andrew for your very kind introduction and I\u2019d like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S Attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan our doing here for the people of Michigan and all the law enforcement community from Michigan, that is here today. We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you\u2019ll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum \u2014 especially Elaine Didier \u2014 for hosting this event. I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, it\u2019s hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it\u2019s especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who\u2019ve come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.</p><p>I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S Attorney here in the Western District, so John it\u2019s great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it\u2019s appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn\u2019t a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration.</p><p>I\u2019m privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States\u2019 response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890\u2019s, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It\u2019s because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What\u2019s at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien spoke about the CCP\u2019s ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \u201cthe days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China are over.\u201d And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I\u2019ll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: \u201cIf she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people\u2026 this last impression \u2013 of the reality of China's colossal potential \u2013 is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\u201d It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People\u2019s Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\u201cMade in China 2025\u201d is the latest iteration of the PRC\u2019s state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\u2019s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors\u2019 ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \u201cforeign aid,\u201d in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\u2019s strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\u2019s plans to dominate the world\u2019s digital infrastructure through its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\u2019s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\u2019s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\u201d a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC\u2019s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. \u201cSince then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\u201d in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America\u2019s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China\u2019s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\u2019s predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world\u2019s largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy.\u201d China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of dictatorship.\u201d</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China\u2019s meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S -China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \u201cHow America\u2019s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\u201dThe article details how China\u2019s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.</p><p>China\u2019s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States\u2019 largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China\u2019s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \u201ccreating their own competitors.\u201d</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \u201cAPIs.\u201d As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \u201c[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\u201d it \u201ccould result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\u201d</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\u2019s rulers went to the same playbook they\u2019ve used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \u201chigh-value-added-industry\u201d and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China\u2019s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC\u2019s goal is to replace you. As a U.S Chamber of Commerce report put it, \u201c[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\u201d</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China\u2019s political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration\u2019s China Strategy recognizes, \u201cthe CCP\u2019s campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China\u2019s borders.\u201d Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence \u2014 even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood\u2019s actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movieWorld War Zdepicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbusterDr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \u201cAncient One,\u201d a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \u201cif you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\u201d Or, as the Chinese government might say, \u201c[w]e\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\u201d</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry\u2019s submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world\u2019s largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market \u2014 both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China\u2019s WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood \u2014 and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \u201c[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\u201d Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America\u2019s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \u201cliberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\u201d Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China \u2014 the world\u2019s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.</p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant \u2013 when we have a warrant from a court \u2013 that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China\u2019s government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\u2019s request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a \u201cfriendly face\u201d on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \u201cguanxi\u201d \u2014 or system of influential social networking \u2014 necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \u201cagents\u201d of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \u201cConfucius Institutes,\u201d which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\u2019s demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America\u2019s economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China\u2019s drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas.There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America\u2019s troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney producedKundun, the 1997 film about the PRC\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\u2019t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn\u2019t last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized forKundun, calling it a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park\u2019s full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter\u2019s earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell \u2014 later Justice Powell \u2014 sent an important memorandum to the U.S Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. \u201c[T]he time has come,\u201d he said, \u201cindeed, it is long overdue \u2014 for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\u201d So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: \u201cStrength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\u201d Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC\u2019s draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we \u2014 the American people, the American government, and American business together \u2014 can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3538511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D0-FK91-F0YC-N32W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Barr Delivers Remarks at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum[1]Thank you very much, Andrew for your very kind introduction and I'd like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S. Attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan our doing here for the people of Michigan and all the law enforcement community from Michigan, that is here today. We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you'll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum   especially Elaine Didier   for hosting this event. I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. </p><p>Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it's great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it's appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn't a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration.I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890's, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that 'the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.' And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I'll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: 'If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people this last impression - of the reality of China's colossal potential - is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.' It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: 'hide your strength and bide your time.' That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkrieg an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, 'Made in China 2025' sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.'Made in China 2025' is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's 'Belt and Road' infrastructure initiative. Although billed as 'foreign aid,' in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism. Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its 'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,' a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. 'Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,' in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer   allowing us to serve as the world's 'arsenal of democracy.' China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's 'arsenal of dictatorship.'How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled 'How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.' The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers   including American companies   from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively 'creating their own competitors.'America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as 'APIs.' As one Defense Health Agency official noted, '[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],' it 'could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.'To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they've used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a 'high-value-added-industry' and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, '[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.'Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps. If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, 'the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.' Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence   even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.Take Hollywood. Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.For example, the hit movieWorld War Zdepicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.In the Marvel Studios blockbusterDr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the 'Ancient One,' a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that 'if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.' Or, as the Chinese government might say, '[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.'These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party. The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market   both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood   and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, '[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.' Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which 'liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.' Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China   the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant - when we have a warrant from a court - that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives   efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a 'friendly face' on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the 'guanxi'   or system of influential social networking   necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the 'agents' of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded 'Confucius Institutes,' which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands. In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney producedKundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized forKundun, calling it a 'stupid mistake.' Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.During the Cold War, Lewis Powell   later Justice Powell   sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. '[T]he time has come,' he said, 'indeed, it is long overdue   for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.' So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: 'Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.' Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule. The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we   the American people, the American government, and American business together   can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.

Barr Delivers Remarks at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you very much, Andrew for your very kind introduction and I'd like to say that I really appreciate the work that Andrew and Matt, our U.S. Attorneys for the Eastern and Western District of Michigan our doing here for the people of Michigan and all the law enforcement community from Michigan, that is here today. We really appreciate your work and as Andrew said, after my remarks they are going to put on a presentation of the China Initiative, which I think you'll find very interesting, so if you have the time I urge you to stay for that. I would like to thank the leadership and staff of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum especially Elaine Didier for hosting this event. I also thank the Ford Presidential Foundation and its Executive Director Joe Calvaruso. Even under normal circumstances, it's hard to put together an event like this, but in the current circumstances it's especially challenging and I really appreciate it. And I really appreciate all of you who've come, I know many have come from around the state and I appreciate the effort that was made to be here for these remarks.</p><p/><p>I was last in Grand Rapids, it would be 30 years ago John. John Smietanka, from here, was one of my Principal Deputy when I was Deputy Attorney General and stayed on while I was Attorney General. He was U.S. Attorney here in the Western District, so John it's great to see you here. I feel a special bond to the Ford Administration so it's appropriate to be here today for these remarks, because I started out in the CIA in 1973 and President Ford took office and because of what was going on at the agency, I had the privilege of working closely with many of the superb people that he brought into government. Many of whom I had the opportunity to work with over the years, several of whom were my mentors. One of the people I met was the Attorney General, at that time, Ed Levi, who President Ford made Attorney General. His portrait is up in my conference room and his grandson Will Levi is my Chief of Staff, so as I say, I feel a special closeness with the Ford Administration even though I wasn't a political appointee in that administration. Many of the political appointees that I work with over the years really cut their teeth during the Ford Administration.</p><p>I'm privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States' response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890's, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It's because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What's at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien spoke about the CCP's ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \"the days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People's Republic of China are over.\" And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I'll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: \"If she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people... this last impression of the reality of China's colossal potential is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\" It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: \"hide your strength and bide your time.\" That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>The People's Republic of China is now engaged in an economic blitzkriegan aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent technological superpower. A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party's \"Made in China 2025\" initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S. technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \"Made in China 2025\" sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\"Made in China 2025\" is the latest iteration of the PRC's state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China's communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world's maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors' ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC's \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \"foreign aid,\" in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC's strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC's plans to dominate the world's digital infrastructure through its \"Digital Silk Road\" initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world's most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC's efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its \"Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\" a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC's drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. \"Since then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\" in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America's top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China's progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC's predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world's largest manufacturer allowing us to serve as the world's \"arsenal of democracy.\" China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world's \"arsenal of dictatorship.\"</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China's meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC's accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S.-China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \"How America's Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\" The article details how China's communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world's largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers including American companies from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.</p><p>China's dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States' largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China's government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \"creating their own competitors.\"</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world's largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \"APIs.\" As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \"[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\" it \"could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\"</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China's rulers went to the same playbook they've used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \"high-value-added-industry\" and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China's health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S. academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>As all of these examples should make clear, the ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards. But in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you. As a U.S. Chamber of Commerce report put it, \"[t]he belief by foreign companies that large financial investments, the sharing of expertise and significant technology transfers would lead to an ever opening China market is being replaced by boardroom banter that win-win in China means China wins twice.\"</p><p>Although Americans hoped that trade and investment would liberalize China's political system, the fundamental character of the regime has never changed. As its ruthless crackdown of Hong Kong demonstrates once again, China is no closer to democracy today than it was in 1989 when tanks confronted pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square. It remains an authoritarian, one-party state in which the Chinese Communist Party wields absolute power, unchecked by popular elections, the rule of law, or an independent judiciary. The CCP surveils its own people and assigns them social credit scores, employs an army of government censors, tortures dissidents, and persecutes religious and ethnic minorities, including a million Uighurs detained in indoctrination and labor camps.</p><p>If what happened in China stayed in China, that would be bad enough. But instead of America changing China, China is leveraging its economic power to change America. As this Administration's China Strategy recognizes, \"the CCP's campaign to compel ideological conformity does not stop at China's borders.\" Rather, the CCP seeks to extend its influence around the world, including on American soil.</p><p>All too often, for the sake of short-term profits, American companies have succumbed to that influence even at the expense of freedom and openness in the United States. Sadly, examples of American business bowing to Beijing are legion.</p><p>Take Hollywood. Hollywood's actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood's ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \"Ancient One,\" a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \"if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he's Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\" Or, as the Chinese government might say, \"[w]e're not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\"</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O'Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry's submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world's largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China's WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S. box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S. technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \"[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\" Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \"liberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\" Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China the world's most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.</p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant when we have a warrant from a court that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China's government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC's request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S. politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a \"friendly face\" on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America's corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \"guanxi\" or system of influential social networking necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \"agents\" of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don't mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \"Confucius Institutes,\" which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP's demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America's economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China's drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America's troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC's oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn't let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn't last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \"stupid mistake.\" Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park's full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter's earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>During the Cold War, Lewis Powell later Justice Powell sent an important memorandum to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He noted that the free enterprise system was under unprecedented attack, and urged American companies to do more to preserve it. \"[T]he time has come,\" he said, \"indeed, it is long overdue for the wisdom, ingenuity and resources of American business to be marshaled against those who would destroy it.\" So too today. The American people are more attuned than ever to the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses not only to our way of life, but to our very lives and livelihoods. And they will increasingly call out corporate appeasement.</p><p>If individual companies are afraid to make a stand, there is strength in numbers. As Justice Powell wrote: \"Strength lies in organization, in careful long-range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort, and in the political power available only through united action and national organizations.\" Despite years of acquiescence to communist authorities in China, American tech companies may finally be finding their courage through collective action. Following the recent imposition of the PRC's draconian national security law in Hong Kong, many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zoom, and LinkedIn, reportedly announced that they would temporarily suspend compliance with governmental requests for user data. True to form, communist officials have threatened imprisonment for noncompliant company employees. We will see if these companies hold firm and how long they will hold firm. I hope they do. If they stand together, they will provide a worthy example for other American companies in resisting the Chinese Communist Party's corrupt and dictatorial rule.</p><p>The CCP has launched an orchestrated campaign, across all of its many tentacles in Chinese government and society, to exploit the openness of our institutions in order to destroy them. To secure a world of freedom and prosperity for our children and grandchildren, the free world will need its own version of the whole-of-society approach, in which the public and private sectors maintain their essential separation but work together collaboratively to resist domination and to win the contest for the commanding heights of the global economy. America has done that before and we rekindle our love and devotion for our country and each other, I am confident that we the American people, the American government, and American business together can do it again. Our freedom depends on it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123826196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CJ-84W1-JCBF-S11K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dudley, President and Chief Executive Officer</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moderator: Rob Cox, Global Editor, Reuters Breakingviews</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">James Rosener:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Distinguished guests, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen: good morning. My name is James Rosener. I'm President of the European American Chamber of Commerce, and managing partner of the New York Office of Pepper Hamilton. First, let me thank Thomson Reuters for hosting this event and our own partnership with them together.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On behalf of the European American Chamber of Commerce, it's a great pleasure to welcome you today to a program on \"Banking Culture: Room for Improvement?\", which brings together three of the foremost thinkers on the subject. Here with us today are William Dudley, President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank; William Rhodes, President and CEO of WR Rhodes Global Advisors, and author of Banker to the World; and Ellen Alemany, Chairwoman and CEO of CIT Group, who also brings us a European perspective from her tenure in London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Among our esteemed guests, we also have Stuart Mackintosh, Executive Director of the Group of Thirty. And moderating today's panel is Rob Cox, editor of Breakingiews, of Reuters News.</p><p>This panel discussion is particularly important as many consumers are still with the process of rebuilding wealth and financial services firms continue to struggle with consumer mistrust as well as regulatory compliance issues.</p><p>We all remember the crisis of 2007 and 2008, and how it shook the foundations of the exciting economic system. People all over the world became increasingly angry, cynical, and distrustful. Stock markets plummeted, companies collapsed, individuals watched their savings evaporate, and unemployment rose to levels unseen in decades.</p><p>In the aftermath of the global crisis, regulators introduced a wide range of measures and began implementing stricter micro- and macroprudential policies intending to strengthen the resilience and stability of the economic system.</p><p>Although in the years since the financial crisis, authorities have increased investigative and enforcement capabilities, punished business for misconduct, and addressed violations, we've learned from a number of scandals and corporate abuses regularly making the headlines that malfeasance, reckless business practices and behavior are a common and widespread phenomenon across business sectors worldwide.</p><p>Almost every active observer acknowledges that the state of affairs represents a bigger problem and calls for drastic change in culturehow employees and management interact and handle business affairs.</p><p>Just last Friday, the Fed made it clear to the entire banking system that it will hold boards of directors responsible for conduct and impose limitations on growth where financial institutions have not shown sufficient progress in implementing the kind of risk management that is expected.</p><p>At the same time, we're hearing from the administration about increased deregulation. Thankfully, there's growing and spirited debate on culture and conduct. A majority of banks and institutions are active participants in the debate. They employ consultants, host workshops and conferences, and adopt culture-oriented mission statements. Everyone agrees there's plenty of room for improvement. Creating a virtuous business culture is not an easy task and presents some serious challenges.</p><p>We hope this discussion will shed some light on how banks and financial institutions can benefit from corporate governance best practicesspecifically culture changeand overcome the widespread negative perceptions that continue to rattle the sector.</p><p>I encourage all participants to engage in the discussions. Do not hesitate to ask questions, not only of our panelists but to one another, and make this a truly interactive event. Thank you for your attention, and I hope you enjoy this important discussion.</p><p>With that, I'll handle it over to Rob Cox.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Thanks Jim. Good morning everybody. Thank you for braving the incipient snow and getting yourselves away from your screens, showing us reds and greens in the stock market. It's hard to believe it's only Wednesday. But I can only surmise from your participation here that you also see a link between culture, banking culture, and the global economy, as I think these panelists that we have up here do, and have done quite a bit to champion our thinking in that regard.</p><p>They don't need any introduction. You've got their bios. Their reputations precede them. I thought I'd just start with you, Bill D. I'm going to go with Bill D, it could be your hip-hop name when you retire next year. But we have two Bills here.</p><p>So, four years ago, you kicked off this conversation with a conference on banking culture, and forming banking culture. It's gone global. Are you happy with the progress that's been made up to now? What's the state of affairs in our understanding of good bank culture?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, I guess I would say I'm pleased that there's been substantial progress, but I'm not satisfied with the progress. In other words, there could be even more progress. I think in the United States, for example, we could do more in terms of having an industry-wide survey that actually allows firms to benchmark their results versus one anotherwe have that in the U.K.</p><p>We could probably do more to address the so-called \"rolling bad apple problem.\" This is where someone leaves a firm after bad behavior, and then gets hired by another firm that's completely unaware of why that person was let go.</p><p>So we proposedthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York has proposed a banking registry, where you could actually keep track of why people actually were dismissed.</p><p>There is something similar to that in the U.K., so I think they've actually made a bit more progress than we have. The good news, though, is I think bankers are taking this a lot more seriously. A number of bank leaders have endorsed working on culture. A number of boards of directors have set up committees on culture. So, I thinkhave we gotten as far as we need to go? No. Have we made a lot of progress? Yes.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>You're speaking as the New York Fed President, but what is your sense of other folks around the world, whether it's the Bank of England who are starting the Financial Conduct Authority, or whoever it might be in the U.K. and Europe.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>I think there's a pretty broad acceptance of the notion that regulation and compliance only takes you so far, and that bad conduct really does undermine the effectiveness of the financial system, because it basically reduces trust.</p><p>We saw in the middle of the financial crisis that it was the breakdown of confidence in the system that really led to the severity of the Great Recession. And I'm not sure how much conduct played into that, but I think it probably played a role.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Bill R, a question for you. Maybe stepping back, what are we talking about when we talk about culture? It's not yogurt, right? As someone who has been a banker for many years, and now has spent a lot of time looking at this issue from the vantage point of the G30, how do you characterize culture?</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>I think culture is really made up of the history, tradition, and values of a given institution. Each institution is different, and it must look to those three elements, and it can't be imposed by the supervisors and regulators, which they understand. I mean, this isn't something like capital, where you can sayor liquidity</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Which is a number?</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Exactly. At the end of the day, though, it's the most important element of all, because if you don't have a good culture and you don't enact it in the sense of conduct, you're going to ruin your reputation. And once an institution, particularly a financial institution, loses its reputation, then it is a very, very difficult road to slog back.</p><p>And this is why the Group of Thirty decided to get into this area in the first place. We've been working on it for five years. We are now finalizing with our third report, and as we go around the world in all areas of the world, we are finding that financial institutions, mainly banks, understand the importance of this thing. And if we needed to have a reminder, it was the Great Recession, and what occurred there.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>One of the things that's come out of this discussion, I think it was Baroness O'Neill in the U.K., her argument was that you have to ask yourself as an institution, what are you for?</p><p>And I think that's a pretty interestingI think any company, it doesn't have to be a bank, but certainly a bankthere are certain other social imperatives to make sure that you know what you are for. How would you, Ellen, describe what CIT is for?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Sure, actually CIT has a very long history, but it's a 110-year-old company that started out as a commercial finance company in St. Louis, as Commercial Credit and Investment Trust, which then became Commercial and Investment Trust, CIT.</p><p>It had a lot of different owners. It was unregulated, and what happened was it took TARP money during the crisis, filed bankruptcy, and then reemerged, and then acquired OneWest Bank.</p><p>So when I took over the company, it definitely had \"who are we?\" And I think one of the first things we had to do with employees was really come up with a specific \"this is our strategy,\" which is to give loans and leasing to small and middle-market companies on a national basis, funded by deposits. And a very clear statement.</p><p>We alsobecause of all the different ownerships, and unregulated/regulated et ceterareally didn't have a value set at the company. And so another exercise I did with the team was we did a cultural survey, and it was really telling what came out of the cultural survey, but as a result of that, we said \"what are the top behaviors that we want for the company going forward?\"</p><p>And we came up with six behaviors. The first was straight talk. In the institution, we found that people were just really afraid to be open and to talk about bad news. And so straight talk was the first.</p><p>The second was collaboration. Everybody just wanted to be left alone. That was one thing that came out loud and clear in the survey, it was just \"leave me alone.\" They felt if they were doing their piece of the project, that was enough. No one was looking at the enterprise-wide or the full picture.</p><p>Accountability was another one. When 15 people sign a credit memo, who's really accountable?</p><p>And then we also came up with customer-focused, risk-disciplined, and high-performing. And so these are our six values. And we have to constantly reinforce these values in the company.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>You had to do a fair amount of pruning and pairing back of some of the businesses. You had an international business, aircraft leasing. Does that tell us anything about the difficulty of actually imparting culture across borders, or was it just too difficult to pull all those things together?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>No, I mean we put a strategy in place that we wanted to be a leading small and middle-market domestic lender, and we did a strategic review of the company, and we saw that we were in many countries. These businesses were underperforming. There was no connectivity with any of the other businesses.</p><p>We also felt that an aircraft leasing company shouldn't be in a bank because of the capital requirements on the forward order book. So, this was all part of a clear, crisp strategy for the employees, for our shareholders, and then executing against it.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Bill Rhodes, you were at Citigroup for many, many years. It in many ways it defines sort of the international banking culture. Just thinking about that culturenot necessarily Citigroupbut when do you think it lost its way a bit? That American banking culture, the global culture of banking?</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Well, when I started out in banking, which was obviously a long time ago, we had embedded in us three things. First of all, the reputation of the bank. That was number one. But also along with that was the need to look after your customer, and also work with the community.</p><p>These were the three basic values that were embedded in us. Along the way, unfortunately, I think it shifted to short-term profitability, and those early, let's say \"commandments\" tended to be forgotten. And what was the result of this? The financial institutionsagain, we're talking banks herelost the trust of the public, the shareholders, and even of their own staff. And we can see this in some of the more recent cases like Wells Fargo. All three of them are there.</p><p>The other point which people tend to forget, and this is just basic business logic for success, is that if you have a good culture and you act in the proper way, conduct-wise, you are going to do better in your business. It's something that Mario Draghi always says, and he's correct. It's that good business practices, in the sense of culture and conduct, makes your customer feel better, loyal, and people want to bank with an institution that has that.</p><p>So at the end of the day, this is something that pays off to the so-called bottom line. The whole idea of having a proper culture and conduct, embedding it, monitoring it, and very, very importantly, what do you do if someone crosses the line?</p><p>I think first of all, you have to look at compensation for the individual. Take a hit compensation-wise, and if that doesn't do it, then you look at termination. I think these are all basic points that we've seen, and pretty much agreed to in our surveys of the Group of Thirty.</p><p>As I said, we are finalizing that now. There are a lot of other things we came forth with. But this is basically what I think happened along the way. And if institutions, banks are smart, they will never allow themselves to go back to that.</p><p>Forget about what the regulators and supervisors say. The institution itself is the first line of defense. And it's always easy when the problems come up, to say, well, the rating agencies gave us triple-A on this particular instrument, and the supervisors, regulators didn't pick it up. And oh, by the way, the politicians were pushing us to make those mortgage loans. No matter what it took.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>When I think about what you just said, it sounds to me like the cult of shareholder value may have been more influential in forcing companies to think, or bankscompanies generally, but let's keep it to banksin thinking about short-term reward, or short-term incentives.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Well, that was all part of the short-term profitability. And that was, as you know, for a period of time the most important metric, and the press built it up. You know, what's the shareholder value and</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>But I'm wondering how do you balance this need to serve shareholders who can turf out a CEO or the boards of directors? At any time, you always have that barometer of the stock price. Bill, you want to answer this? I also want to ask Ellen: how do you manage this? You've got on the one hand your investors, and on the other, you've got this need to build a long-term, stable, culturally good institution.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Yes, but if your customer does not trust you and the public does not trust you, it's going to fall to the bottom line. So, good business practices like the ones I've mentioned actually help the bottom line. And when you don't have that, you can see the consequences.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Yes, yes. Bill Dudley?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>You asked the question, why does this happen? I think there are a lot of reasons, but there are two things that I guess I would talk about. Number one is business became more transactional rather than client-focused, and that's partly the growth of the capital markets.</p><p>The second thing is scale. The scale of the institutions got a lot larger. And so I think it became much harder for people at the top to actuallyfor their views to penetrate deep into the organization.</p><p>I really do have a question about whether it's actually possible to manage organizations of several hundred thousand people effectively. Time will tell. One reason to work on culture, though, is to actually get the views of the CEO, and the executive suite, to penetrate down into the organization. It's really difficult the bigger you get and the more complex you get.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>So how do you manage this balance? Milton Friedman on the one hand and Bill Rhodes on the other, in making sure you're delivering for shareholders but at the same time delivering for the long term and not creating problems down the road?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Sure, before I answer that question, though, I think if there's any one takeaway from today, it is the point that Bill made, is that having a good culture is good business. And it's the tone from the top and believing that if your colleagues are engaged, if your customers are satisfied, if the communities you do business with prosper, then business is going to prosper, which in turn turns into shareholder value.</p><p>And it's always that balance between the short and the long term. And we manage that through lots of different ways. Compensation is only one piece. But in compensation we make sure that we have a balanced business scorecard for the senior managers.</p><p>So, a percentage is based on the financial results, and it's not just one financial measure, it's several financial measures. And then the other piece is qualitative. We break it up into three bucketsstrategic/operational, risk, and then people/culture. Does this employee demonstrate the CIT values?</p><p>We also have clawback, and by having this qualitative, too, if something does go bad or someone doesn't do something that we think is appropriate, you have enough flexibility there to manage the compensation.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>I want to delve further into incentives because I think it's really critical to this conversation. But just sort of stepping back a little bit to my first question to you, Bill Dudley, which was about the progress we've made. A corollary to that is the President has talked quite a bit about his deregulatory efforts. We've certainly seen some measures from the House Financial Services Committee that probably will never see the light of day in the Senate. But we also have seen the Senate with its bill to soften, shall we say, parts of the Dodd-Frank Act. Is there a danger that this whole cultural discussion gets thrown out with this deregulatory swing back of the pendulum?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, first of all, I guess I don't think that the deregulatory swing is going to be that great, thankfully. I've been talking about this for many months about how it's really important, while we can make regulations simpler and more efficient, that makes a lot of sense, we don't want to go back to where we were in 2007, 2008. So higher capital requirements, higher liquidity requirements, better resolution regime, the ability to centrally clear over-the-counter derivatives, regulate the entities that we clear these through, all of those things need to be kept. Orderly liquidation authority. And so far I'm actually pretty optimistic that the regulatory reforms are going to be around the edges as opposed to wholesale.</p><p>The second thing I would just say, though, is that regulation and culturethese are complements, not substitutes. If you think that regulation can somehow substitute for culture, I think you're really mistaken. In fact, in some ways, the more intense the regulatory regime, it can actually undermine culture, because people can actually say, well, the regulators are saying what I can and cannot do, and so as long as I stick within the confines of those regulations, it's all fine.</p><p>But that's actually not true. Just because a regulation sets this frame or field of scope, there may be things within that that you actually don't want to do. There are number of examples, as we saw, during the financial crisis. One of the most famous ones was Repo 105, which Lehman Brothers did to dress up their balance sheet to misrepresent their balance sheet to the public. That was legal under the accounting rules, but very deceptive. So that was an example where if you just go by what's regulatory-appropriate, you can actually have very bad outcomes.</p><p>So I think that it's not one or the other. You need a good regulatory regime supplemented by various good conduct and culture in the organizations.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>But I was recently in London speaking to the CEO of a big U.K. bank, and he was saying, \"I'm really worried that they're going to relax the Volcker Rule,\" for instance, and \"If those guys are trading using their balance sheet, how are we going to compete?\" And so there's definitely a fear about this.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Oh, you're right, there's always a little bit of pressure that regulation gets rolled back in one regime and everyone says, oh, now these people are more competitive than our people. And so the \"race to the bottom\" problem is obviously all something we have to be aware of.</p><p>That's one reason why I think that the U.S. involvement in Basel with the Bank for International Settlements is important because that helps establish minimum standards that are implemented across the world, to essentially lean against that pressure to race to the bottom in terms of regulation.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>But some thingsfor instance, relaxing the threshold at which you're a G-SIFI, things like thatthat would help CIT, I would imagine. In other words, you can hold less capital as a result of some of these rule changes.</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>We're in an interesting situation because we're actually the first bank in the U.S. that actually raised our hand and said we want to become SIFI. And then we decided to sell the aircraftwe would have been about $80 billion in assets, and we decided to sell our aircraft leasing business, and now we are right at the cusp. We're around $50 billion in assets.</p><p>And I had gotten so many questions from investors, our board, et cetera. \"Do you de-SIFI?\" \"Will you save a lot of money if you de-SIFI because you don't have to spend money doing these things?\"</p><p>And we sat there as a management team and we said, you know what? We needed to improve our capital planning process at the company, and that a lot of what is required for a SIFI bank, and if we want to build a strong foundation to grow the company going forward, we needed to invest in.</p><p>So, if the threshold changes, it's really not going to impact what we do day-to-day, because the Federal Reserve Bank still requires us to have a capital planning process that meets the new standards. The standards have been raised for the industry. And we want to build a strong foundation for the company.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>So, does that mean if you don't have to, even if you don't have to hold an extra one basis point of capital, you would?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>No, it's more ofthe whole capital planwhat's involved with the capital planning process. And we also want to maintain capital that's appropriate for the risk profile of the company. And just because the regulators demand a certain level, it's our assessment of what capital is appropriate for the risks that we're taking as a company. It's a guideline.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>What is your sense of the regulatory environment? How has it changed with the examiners or whoever it is that are sort of crawling around the bank? Are they now smiling, offering lollipops? [CROSSTALK] Pretend Bill is not here. Is there a mood music change of some sort?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>I think that the tone at the top is different in terms of what people are sayinghow it actually flows down and impacts us on a day-to-day basis. It really hasn't changed yet in the regulations. For us, there's been more of a tone change at the OCC rather than the Federal Reserve Bank.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>People act like this is sort of this big giant fight between firms and the supervisors. In a lot of ways, the interests are actually very well aligned. We want to have good risk management. We want to have good governance. We want to have adequate capital, adequate liquidity. The firms presumably want all of the same things. So this idea that we're all going head-to-head, I just don't think that is really actually how good supervision and good private sector engagement with that supervision actually works.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>So you don't have grumpy examiners on your staff?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>I'm sure we have some grumpy examiners on our staff.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>I mean this actually goes back to the questionyou mentioned it before, Ellenwhich is good culture being good business. Bill, you wrote a column for us over the summer in which you pointed out that misdeeds and bad behavior and settlements have cost the industry something like $330 billion since the crisis. I mean, that's coming right out of shareholder value.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Now it's somewhere north of, I think, $350 billion. Those are Boston Consulting figures.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Yes, but of course, you know, everything is doing well, everybody is making tons of money now. Is there a risk that these settlements and fines that we've seen meted out are basically just seen by bankers as a cost of doing business over the cycle?</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>I certainly don't think so, because in addition to what fines you're paying, you're getting very bad publicity. And it doesn't make the shareholders, your staff, or your customers very happy when they see something like this. Forget about the impact on the bottom line.</p><p>And I think Ellen commented on the tone at the top, which is key. But it must go right down to middle management, or right down to the teller level. Everyone has to be a believer in this, and they have to practice it. It has to be embedded and monitored throughout.</p><p>And as I said, and then when you have bad playersbad apples, as Bill saidcompensation is a first hit. But eventually you're going to have to go to termination. And I think this has to be understood all the way from the top down to the bottom.</p><p>The other point is that if, in fact, we see let's say less regulation and supervision across the system, that gives even more importance to the culture and conduct area. Because the last thing an institution wants to do is to repeat some of the failures that we've seen over the last decade or more.</p><p>And I think these things built up over the last 20 years or soit didn't happen overnight. And the price to pay, with loss of trustforget about the financial settlementsI think has been significant. Because what do you find today? The area of trust has still not I think fully been given by any of the constituents, as I mentioned, to the institutions. Plus the politicians around the worldparticularly in the United States, Canada, Western Europeare still very I'd say antsy about the banking system, as you can see. So I think we still have a lot of work to go in this area. We've made progress but it's like a stop on a train. You've got more distance to go.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>How do you feel?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Two things that I think are important. Number one, the fines have gotten a lot bigger. At times there's been actually a risk to firms that's existential. The risk of actually losing your charter. So, I think that's causing the senior management to take this a lot more seriously. So I think that's an important change from what we had before.</p><p>I think the second thing is the industry is held in not such high regard now. And that has actually consequences for their ability to attract talent. So we've been having a number of business school deans come in and talk to us at New York Fed over the last few years, and what they say is that there are people who will actually not go into the financial services industry because of this bad conduct. That's not a good cycle. If the most ethical people coming out of the business schools decide that they are not going to go into this industry, that means there's quite a bit more work to do.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>They're all going into journalism.</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Bill D. actually makes a really good point. By the year 2020, 50% of our workforce is going to be millennials, and the millennials prioritize different things than we did coming up in our careers. They want corporate social responsibility. They want culture, they want values. And so if you have a good culture, it's really a competitive advantage in terms of attracting the millennials to your workforce.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>So, Bill, you said in one of your speeches on this topic that incentives shape behavior, and behavior drives culture. If you want a culture that will support your long-term business strategy, you need to align incentives with the behaviors that will sustain your business over the long haul.</p><p>This is for all of you, but I'll start with you, Bill D. What specifically has been done around the issue of compensation? What are you seeing when you look at comp plans, and not just for the CEOs and CFOs, but throughout the organizations?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>The reason why I stress that, because people always say, culture is sort of a soft subject, so what can we actually do about it as leaders in banking organizations. Well, you can look at how you compensate people, how you promote people. Those are things that you can actually set. And by having an appropriate set of incentives, you're probably going to get the behaviors that are more consistent with what you desire. And if you get that, over time, that will actually establish the culture of the organization. That will sort of set the social norms that define the organization.</p><p>So, the reason why I stress incentives is this is something that senior management actually has control over. There are things that they can actually do in terms of how people are compensated, how they are evaluated, how they are promoted. And that's why I really</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Well, what are those things? If you were to trace back to 2006</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Look, I think we've made some progress on the compensation front, in the sense that there's more deferral of compensation, and there's more scope for clawbacks. But I personally think that there's scope for doing even more on this front.</p><p>If you go back to the old partnership model where people actually had their capital tied up in the firm, and couldn't get their capital back until years after they retired, they had strong incentives to make sure that the firm didn't</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>You were at Goldman when it was a partnership, right?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, I wasn't a partner when it was a partnership. But, yeah, I think that culture was helpful in terms of risk management. The willingness to take risk. So, one thing you could look at for example is do we really want to have all these deferrals in the form of stock grants? Maybe we should have these deferrals in the form of total loss-absorbing debt.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Like a hybrid coco or whatever those things are?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, or just something that basically if the firm does badly in the future, and fails, the compensation that has been deferred in the form of debt gets converted to equity, and the management actually has to suffer some of the consequences.</p><p>Another thing that I think would be really worth looking at a little bit would be who pays the fines when firms have bad conduct and behavior. Why does it always come out of the shareholder's pocket? The shareholders may not have even been shareholders at the time of the bad behavior. Maybe there should be a device that could actually reach down and grab some money out of the pockets of the managers who actually were responsible for the bad behavior and the bad conduct.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>What have you done Ellen? Do you have specific formulas? Is there something you can tell us about the contours of your incentive schemes that are designed to do exactly what Bill is talking about?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Sure, I just touched on some of it before, but at least for the senior team, we put a balanced business scorecard in place that'sa percentage of it is financial performance, with financial targets. And then there's a qualitative piece. We also have deferral through performance stock units and restricted and stock units. And then we also have clawback.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Have you had to ever claw anything back?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Not at my current firm, but in a prior firm that I worked at, yes, we have used the clawback for employees. And I actually think that the European banks use it a little more aggressively than the American institutions, and they were reallythe European banks were the first to implement clawback.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Is that right? When you were at Citi in the '80s and '90s, you probably didn't have all of these kinds of highfalutin bells and whistles on compensation then.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Well, the compensation was a lot lower to start off with.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Oh, that's true.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>I want to just pick up some of the things that Ellen and Bill have said. I think it's very important that your staffwe talk about those at the top, the middle management down to the tellerhave pride in the institution that they are working for. And this then spills over to the client and the customer. And I think that's when we're going to get the trust level back. And then when you talk about pros and cons of rating people, for compensation, one of the things that has become somewhat controversial is the role of the whistleblower.</p><p>A lot of institutions don't even call it whistleblowing, they call itI think in CIT, Ellen told me it's a hotline. And the responsibility that if you're sitting next to somebody, or you see something that is not correct, that you will speak up in some form or fashion. And I can run through some institutions where this did not happen, or where the employee tried to speak up and was suppressed or even fired.</p><p>And so I think it's key to maintain the pride of the employees and the trust of your customers, that you have some sort of mechanism where if an employee sees something that's being done incorrectly, he or she will speak up. And it makes a lot of sense that this be done really right up to the board level, because what do you want to do? Read about it in the newspaper? Or have your friendly supervisor call you and say, \"We just got a call from someone in your organization saying they've seen this or that.\"</p><p>And I think that has been another problem. This was suppressed during this period of time. The whole idea of people in the institutions speaking up, and that also has to go back to pride in the institution, that they will do so because they think it's wrong and they don't want to be with an institution that does bad things.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>And then senior management has to be receptive to that employee.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Exactly, exactly. Right up to the board level. Because too oftenin our first report, as Stuart knows, we worked on, and Billwas the role of the Board. Because too often boards either didn't want to know, or frankly didn't push senior management to let them know what was going on.</p><p>And in the most recent cases that I've seenit's out there. A number of board members of Wells Fargo said we were never told, we didn't know. And it's not just Wells. All of the institutions involved in this in the United States and Europe went through the same bit. So I think this is key.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Let's talk about Wells. Wells is a living and breathing case study, really, in some of this stuff. I mean Bill Dudleythe Fed last week issued an order forbidding Wells from growing its balance sheet further until they say \"sufficient improvements\" in governance and risk management are made.</p><p>As Bill Rhodes points out, four directors, concomitant with this announcement, were leaving the board. I mean if culture is improved broadly across the industry, how are we to interpret what's happened with Wells, which, prior to this last two years, was considered the sort of paragon of good banking culture?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, that goes back to the discussion we were having before on incentives. They had really bad incentives in terms of how they evaluated and compensated their employees. So you were compensated on the basis of how many accounts you opened. And that was sort of problem number one. So the incentives were wrong. And then two, when people complained about itemployees complained about itand went up the chain of command, that was essentially not heard or ignored.</p><p>To Bill's point, you want to have a culture where people are willing and comfortable raising their hands. But that willingness and comfort at raising your hand depends on how that's received in the organization. So at Wells Fargo, apparently, people did raise their hands, or tried to raise their hands, and the message just wasn't received by senior management, and I think it never really got to the board of directors.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Has enough been done on Wells Fargo? I will just say, we've called for a full change of management, CEO level, pretty much since this thing came. We didn't think it wasgiven the level of cultural rot, that you could have someone who had come from that culture running the place. You think they should fire Tim Sloan?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>I don't have a view on that. That's way beyond my pay station. I think Wells Fargo understands that they have to change their culture. I mean, I think they completely understand that. Betsy Duke is the lead director at Wells Fargo, and I've worked with her when she was at the Board of Governors.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>She's chair now.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Yes, she's chair now. And I think they get that they have to do some pretty substantive things to change the culture there. So, the proof of the pudding will be in meeting those, so they actually have to do it. And, you know, it's hard to change culture in very large, complex organizations. It's not something that one can do overnight. The problem that people always talk about is that the people at the top of the house may have the greatest intentions. But how can they actually reach down into the middle layers of management and sort of change how people perceive the organization?</p><p>You can have a lot of cynicism at the mid-level and lower levels. Like, \"Yeah, the senior management is doing this, but they're just doing this because they are under regulatory pressure. They don't really mean it.\" So it is hard to actually change in these large, complex organizations.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>There are successful precedents. One could say JPMorgan and Jamie Dimon, there is a sort of inculcated culture at all levels. Of course, we'll see what happens. Headlines may pop at any time and ruin our view of that. But Ellen, you wanted to say something?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>I just want to pick up on that point that cultural change just doesn't happen overnight. And a lot of the studies say it's at least a three-year process, and it's also just not about the regulatory and the compensation. There's what do you do on a day-to-day basis to make sure that the values and behaviors really flow through the entire organization, and that it's living and breathing within the organization.</p><p>And some of the things that we doin every town hall and through all our communication and messaging to our employees, we talk about culture and we talk about our values.</p><p>I do town halls where I give out a chairwoman's award for employees who demonstrate that they're living our core values and behaviors. And it doesn't sound like a lot, but it really is very meaningful inside the organization. Through some of our corporate programs, like even wellness, to show that we care about our employees. Or we look at our customer complaints. We have a new product approval process where we sit and we talk about, well, gee, what does this product do for the customer?</p><p>We look at business practices, or do you have any financial results that are outsized? I remember taking over a leasing business, and I couldn't figure outit was a business that when I was at Citi, that Citi had acquired, and I couldn't figure out why they made so much more money in their business versus our business. And so we tried to look at the whole process, front end to back end, and realized that this company we bought had really egregious end-of-lease practices, and we immediately terminated those. Because those things aren't sustainable in the long term.</p><p>We have a hotline. I can't tell you how important the hotline is, and it's important that employees feel like they have a safe environment. And we have my head of human resources, my general counsel, and my head of audit chair the ethics committee, and they look at all of the hotline reports that come through and say is there anything here we think we need to investigate further?</p><p>So, as I said, there's just so many things you need to do in the company. Having a diverse board, so that there are board members that are more sensitive to some of these types of issues and ask the questions at the board meeting. There's just a long list of things that need to be done.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>I want to pick up on the Board question, I mean</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>I would say that that is keytone at the top, but all the way down, as I said, to middle management and the teller, because often this gets shipwrecked at the middle-management level. But one of the things that we recommended in our last report, which came out in July 2015, was an incident</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>This is the G30?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>The G30 report, yes. One of the things we recommended is that boards take a look at forming separate committees to look at culture and conduct, because the norm usually was to put audit and risk together. First of all, audit and risk never should have been put together, because the tendency was to spend all the time on the audit side and nothing on the risk side.</p><p>But in addition to having an audit committee and a separate risk committee, a number of institutions have picked upor some institutionshave picked up on our recommendation to form a separate committee on culture and conduct.</p><p>And the reason why this is so important is so you don't get this point that you were making where the board says \"we didn't know what was going on\" type thing. Because they are then responsible for seeing that the culturewhatever it is in the institutionis embedded, is monitored, and then action be taken when an employee does the wrong thing.</p><p>So, I think there have been improvements along the way of getting the board more involved. And Ellen was talking about the hotline, which was very important, in the sense of getting the staff involved right down to the teller level. That everyone feels it's his job, because the whole idea here is when you enter an institution, no matter what level, you want to have some pride in your job. I mean that's the whole idea, to have pride in what you're doing.</p><p>And the reasons that we're getting a lot of college graduate, MBAs, whatever, not wanting to go into the industry is they don't feel this is an area where they could have pride. And that's the whole area of trust that we've got to bring back on the table. And it's not an easy job. As I said, we're like on a train and we made a couple of the right stops, but the journey isn't over.</p><p>And as I mentioned before, it will be even more important if the politicians decide that they want to reduce regulation, supervision, the authority of supervisors and regulatorsthen it's even more important to make sure you have a strong culture and conduct in a positive fashion.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>I've got a couple more questions before I open it up to the audience. One is this question about are you guys anxious at all about some of the financial innovations we've seen. One of the stories yesterday was about the sort of anti-VIX product that Credit Suisse was selling, and actually, it is redounding negatively on the reputation of Credit Suisse, arguably. Or you see the way banks or some of the exchanges have gotten into bitcoin futures. Bill Dudley, are these appropriate products for banks to be selling? Are they culturally appropriate?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>I think it's really a question of the suitability of the clients that the products are being sold to, and their understanding of the risks associated with the products. I don't have a problem with a product being sold to someone as long as that person is a suitable investor for that product and understands the risks of the product. Because you have to be careful hereyou don't want to discourage innovation, and you don't want to discourage offering products that allow a lot of people to hedge risk in various ways, adjust their portfolio for risk.</p><p>But you have to make sure that they are appropriate and well designed. I think the thing that we worry about when we look at the financial system and we worry about financial stability riskswhere are there cases where there are feedback loops?</p><p>So right now with the stock market having a little bumpy ride over the last few days, there's a question: As volatility goes up, is that going to cause people to sell stocks because they have a strategy of investing that's tied to the level of volatility in the stock market? If that were the case, then that could cause the stock market to be bumpy in the future.</p><p>So, it's those feedback loops that we focus on very intensely, when we analyze financial markets for financial stability risk. And I think that firms when they design products, they need to be cognizant of that.</p><p>I mean the classic example is the stock market crash in 1987, when people had this product called portfolio insurance, which meant that when the stock market went down, you had to sell stocks. So as the stock market went down, portfolio insurance kicked in, you had to sell, and that caused the stock market to go down even further.</p><p>That probably was not a very well designed product, and people I don't think had thought through what the implications were, how that product would actually work in practice.</p><p>Some of these VIX products, I think people are going to now look at this with the benefit of hindsight and say, \"Were these really well designed?\"</p><p>This wasn't that big a bump in the equity market, and these products actually blew up. So you have to sort of ask yourself the question, \"Were these products well-designed?\"</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Are there are other elements out there, things that worry you, whether it's risk parity trades or some ETFs? I mean when you look at what's happened in the last couple of days with the stock market, what keeps you up at night?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Look, I think the stock market had a remarkable rise over a very long time, with extremely low volatility. I, and many others, had observed that the valuation of the equity market is elevated. And so having a bump like this has virtually no consequence, in my view, of the economic outlook.</p><p>My outlook hasn't changed just because the stock market is a little bit lower than it was a few days ago. I mean it's still up sharply from where it was a year ago. That said, if the stock market were to go down precipitously, and stay down, then that would actually feed into the economic outlook, and then that would affect my view in terms of the implications for monetary policy.</p><p>But so far, this is a big story in the press. It's a big story for financial market participants. But I don't think it's a big story at all at this point for central bankers.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Go ahead Ellen.</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>What concerns me is really what's being done in the unregulated bank space. So for example, the fintech space. We bought a fintech company, Direct Capital, a couple of years ago. And it took a lot of work to have it work within a bank environment, including significantly reducing the amount of pricing that we earn on the product, the transparency of the terms we give to customers, but they can get a 30-minute credit approval from us.</p><p>But there are other companies out there that, if customers don't understand the fine print, they're being charged 35, 40% on some of these products. It's the business of BDOs out there that are lending to middle-market companies at terms that we haven't seen since before the financial crisis. And my concern is that this is the whole shadow banking system that hurt us during the last crisis, and if interest rates rise substantially, these companies are going to get into trouble, and guess who finances them? Banks. Banks are giving lines of credit to these companies. So I am worried about this whole shadow banking system, and I think that our regulators should look more at some of these, into these.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Can I ask just sort of one corollary, something you raised a minute ago, which was diversity of boards. But let me ask, where does the whole \"Me Too\" movement fit into this discussion about banking culture? I'll start with you, Ellen. Or, how should it?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>No, it does, and I've gotten a lot of questions of, well, gee, why hasn'twe haven't seen financial services companies, fortunately, in the press a lot. And as an industry, we faced this 20 to 30 years ago. The old boom-boom room at Salomon Brothers. I think that the industry, to give it credit, was terrific in terms of sensitivity training, making sure you have a proper code of conduct, actually having public firings, if somebody demonstrated inappropriate behavior, et cetera.</p><p>And I think that it's really positive that people are feeling they can come out and talk about things right now, but I think as an industry, in financial services, we took a lot of steps to avoid that.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Do you agree with that, Bill Dudley? That's sort of been the premise that we've writtenthe sort of \"they went through this.\" The financial industry went through this and created a lot of safeguards.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>You know, I hope so. I hope that's right.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Yes.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>You never know what's unknowable, but I hope that's right. It should be right.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>All right, I'm going to open this up to questions from the audience. Please, no filibustering. Ask your question, state your case. We'll start here with the gentleman. I think we have mics.</p><p>Audience Member:</p><p>Just to follow up on the shadow banking question. If you could elaborate more with respect to the potential risks as far as shadow banking globally. Of course we have it here, but China has a rather large shadow banking situation, and although we can contain it here in the United States, what happens with the risks overseas that might impact the U.S. economy?</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>You want to take that Bill?</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Well, I would just say I think it's a very good question, and I'm very concerned, and Ellen brought it up right now, shadow banking. And you mentioned China, where it's a particular problem.</p><p>It's not clear to me that they've gotten their hands around it either, because every time they close something up, they come up with something else. Trust companiesI could run through all of the instruments, because the Chinese business community is very adept at innovation. And we have to remember that China is the world's second largest economy. In fact, if it hadn't been for China in 2008, when they put a stimulus package in, anywhere from $850 billion to $1 trillion, we would have had a Great Depression, not a Great Recession.</p><p>And so I'm very concerned about that. And China is probably where it's most serious. But as Ellen brought up there are problems here, there are problems in Europe also. When you talk to bankers in Europe, and there was an article in the Financial Times and Reuters the other day about this whole question of regulation of shadow banking in Europe.</p><p>I think it's a major challenge, this whole question of shadow banking, because here we spend the time on supervising, the regulatory side, and what the banking community is doing. And the tendency is you don't see that same effort in the shadow banking area. So I think it's most important.</p><p>Audience Member:</p><p>I have a question really for Bill, just because on a really good day my currency and fixed-income portfolio managers complain about the lack of liquidity in the market, let alone on Friday and Monday. So I'm just wondering how much you view liquidity as an issue and how concerned you are about a liquidity crunch.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, people have been looking at the issue of what have the changes in regulation done to liquidity in various fixed-income markets. I think there's probably been some consequence, for example, in the repo market, and a few other markets.</p><p>But I think generally, I would say market functioning actually seems to be pretty good. I mean there was a period on Friday where there was a very sharp movement downward around three o'clock in the equity market. So there's something that we have to look at and evaluate what really caused that.</p><p>But I think generally, liquidity actually is pretty good. If you look at things like bid-offer, bid-ask spreads, more people can execute. I think it's not as good as it was back in 2006, 2007. But there's a lot of reasons not to want to return to 2006, 2007.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>When you say \"not as good,\" you mean bid-ask spreads</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, I think there's probably not as much depth in the market. In other words, if you want to do a large transaction, you're probably going to have a little bit more of a price concession now than back then.</p><p>People talk about the corporate bond market as one area where dealers have reduced the amount of corporate bonds that they hold on their balance sheets because of capital charges against those corporate bonds have gone up.</p><p>So, I think there has been some consequence, but in general, I think markets are functioning quite well. I think the ability of savers to meet borrowers efficiently in the financial system is very much intact. And actually what we care about is, is the financial system able to supply credit to small businesses, to households, in an efficient manner to support economic growth? And I think if you look around the world, the answer is yes. I mean we have a global synchronized recovery now, which I think is quite positive.</p><p>So, it's something that we're going to continue to look at. There is no question we want to continue to focus on what's the appropriate level of regulation, what are some of the consequences of regulation for things like liquidity? But so far, I would say, we have a much safer financial system, and that's able to perform its function throughout the business cycle.</p><p>Now the other thing is, if you have looser requirements for things like capital and liquidity, it might lead you to have a little bit more free flow of credit at the top of a boom. But what happens if the system then breaks in the economic downturn? So you really want a system that's actually sustainable throughout the business cycle. And I think we have a much better system now to ensure that.</p><p>Audience Member:</p><p>To what extent might banking culture improvement include a reduction in the pay gap between the C-suite and the average worker?</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Ellen?</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>I don't think they have to worry about my pay ratio. No, just kidding. But, you know I think I'm going to pass that to one of the Bills. I'd have to think about that.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Look, I think the issue of income inequality and the issue of income mobility in this country is really important. I think that some of the things that you see happening in the political space is a consequence of U.S. poor performance in both those regards.</p><p>I've been surprised at how high the pay is at the very top of the house. It seems like people would be willing to do the jobs for probably considerably less money. But how we got this result, that's something that people very much debate. People talk about the winner-take-all society.</p><p>I think that as a country we need to do a lot better on working on both the income distribution issue, but even more importantly, in my mind, is income mobility. You know there's a lot of work that Raj Chetty and a number of his associates have done about income mobility, and what they find is where you're born has a huge consequence in your ability to have income mobility through your lifetime.</p><p>So it's not about you, it's actually literally where you were born physically. That says that in the United States we have a lot of work to do, to create a much more even set of opportunities for people so that it doesn't matter where you're born. It depends on your work ethic. So I think there's a lot more we can do in the United States in this realm.</p><p>Audience Member:</p><p>I was just wondering if changing the culture seems like a very noble attempt at changing the industry. But how will you avoid poaching your talent if there are firms that are not on the same objective as you are? You know it happens all the time. It happens with traders, it happens withthey're just going to want to go to a Goldman rather than a Citi if Citi is not paying them.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>Ellen, you brought this up a little bit, the issue of shadow banking is part of that I suppose.</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Yes, I mean so maybe I'm being a little idealistic here, but I don't think it's all about the money. I mean there are some individuals that it's about the money, but I think for the most part, our employees, it's about working for a firm that they can be proud of, that has a good culture, that is interested in long-term shareholder value, et cetera. And I think if you have a good employee proposition, it will prevent some of your employees from being poached. And in institutions where they are having troubles right now, it's actually an opportunity for us because they want to come work for a company where they feel that the employee proposition is very positive.</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>And if it is all about the culture for those individuals, maybe they don't actually fit in with your culture.</p><p>Ellen Alemany:</p><p>Yes, exactly.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>You know we're talking about banking culture. But there are a lot of other industries that havewe've given them a social license with our data, for instance. Big tech is a great example. I don't see conversations like this being promulgated by whatever it isthe regulators, should there be anyof the Googles and the Facebooks. It's great that we're all focused on this, but as a society, are we focusing on the wrong industry right now?</p><p>President Dudley:</p><p>Well, let's take care of the financial industry first, before we start moving out.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>I'm trying to figure out what you're going to do next, Bill.</p><p>Bill Rhodes:</p><p>Well, you know, the answer to that, I think this goes back to the shadow banking and comments that were made here. I think some of these real large, enormous high-tech firms are eyeing, as you read in the newspaper all the time, are eyeing the entrance into the financial sector. And we brought up China before, and this is a big issue now on China, with Alibaba, and the others. How much are the supervisors, regulators going to be allowing them to get into what amounts to virtual banking?</p><p>So it all really goes back to that. And I think it's going to be one of the major issues in the financial system going forward. And the question is, has this really been thought out by the politicians, the supervisors, regulators? Not clear. And very importantly, by the banking industry itself so that it can remain competitive? And so I think it is a major issue going forward, without a doubt.</p><p>Rob Cox:</p><p>I think that is all we've got time for. I want to thank you all for coming out in thisand hopefully you can get out of here, it looks like it's coming down like cats and dogs now. Please thank my panelists, and thank you for coming.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1121893813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RM0-B741-JCBF-S37F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 9, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Good morning. I'm Bob Costa with The Washington Post, a national political reporter. I really appreciate you all coming out for this small business forum and we're so glad to have Larry Kudlow here, the longtime CNBC commentator, writer, author, and now, President Trump's top economic advisor in the White House, focusing on economic policy, directing the National Economic Council. Larry, thanks so much for being here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kudlow: My pleasure, Robert. Starting at New York Fed in open market operations, 1973. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Costa: I wasn't going to date you, Larry. You're starting to bring up the biography, but-</p><p>Kudlow: A couple of stints on Wall Street. And yes, yes, yes, thank you very much. A pleasure to be here.</p><p>Costa: We appreciate you being here at The Washington Post. So I know everyone here is paying attention to the stock market and Larry, when you think about the market over the last few weeks, the last few months, is the president's trade war responsible for the dip?</p><p>Kudlow: I doubt it very much. The economy is so healthy right now and profits are soaring. I've said this a bunch: corrections come and go. I've been around the stock market; I used to work in the stock market as a Wall Street economist. You can't predict it. You can't predict the top, you can't predict the bottom, which by the way, you should all just buy and hold, that's a Kudlow dictum, Jeremy Siegel dictum, et cetera. The closest thing I can see-I'm not giving-this is just my personal opinion. I think a lot of the big, big tech stock, the FANG stocks got pretty toppy and they were due for a correction. That's just one man's opinion. That's not the official White House view or anything like that. I think they let the market down. Correction is probably overdue. </p><p>We had a much bigger one, by the way, last winter. So no, I don't think trade enters into it.</p><p>Costa: Is this the start of a long-term downturn?</p><p>Kudlow: I don't believe so, Robert. The case I make is the economy to me looks so strong and durable right now; confidence is up, jobs are up, blue collar jobs are up, small businesses are up. We'll get to that, I guess. We're seeing very good business investment, which is really the heart of a solid recovery. It may be a little sloppy in the third quarter but capital goods orders are huge right now. So it just seems to me, again, profits are the mother's milk of stocks. Profits are the lifeblood of the economy and I think profits are going to continue to rise and I think we're hitting on all cylinders and I do want to mention, for our group-I'm sorry you can't see this. You probably have. For small business, I'm a great devotee of the NFIB with-I hope I'm not offending anybody, but they do fabulous work, the National Federation of Independent Business. You look through this thing, this is their latest chartbook for September. </p><p>Here, look at this. Look at the optimism index. </p><p>Costa: You say there's a lot of optimism in the economy among small businesses but small businesses want to know about certainty and there's an election next week. </p><p>Kudlow: Yes.</p><p>Costa: If the Democrats take over the House, what should small businesses expect? What does that mean for the Trump economic agenda?</p><p>Kudlow: Well, actually, on that one, I think inside this correction someplace is some nerves about the election. I think that small business and all business and frankly, the workforce is enjoying a very strong economic bloom, which was quite unexpected. Our critics said, \"You're going to stay in one to two percent growth.\" And we've broken out of that. It's at three-percent-plus. So things like corporate taxes, not just the big guys, 21% marginal rate, but also, small business is estimated to have a 19 or 20% effective tax rate down from almost 40. That's a huge thing. I think they're worried about that. I think they're also worried about red tape and regulations, which has been a hallmark of the president's economic growth policies. I think people would be very worried about the energy boom, which is another hallmark of the president's economic growth policy. We will be pumping about 15 million barrels of oil per day in about two years, according to the Interior and Energy Departments. That's really quite-we have so much natural gas that they're flaring it, burning it off and hopefully, we can build a lot of pipelines to use that, sell it to Europe, undermine Russia. Sell it to Asia, maybe undermine China. </p><p>So those hallmarks, there are other policies and we've had a lot of healthcare reforms that I think have helped small business so I think they're worried about that. I think everyone's worried about that. Why would you want to overturn what appears to be a very strong economic period backed up by pro-growth policies where-I don't mean to filibuster; I'll quit in a minute, but where you have a president almost on day one after the election in November 2016-look at this confidence. I apologize, but these things start to really jump.</p><p>Costa: But a lot of businesses-small businesses are nervous about this trade war and they're wondering, win or lose the House next week, just how far is this administration going to go in its trade war with China?</p><p>Kudlow: Well, again, folks like a president who ends the war on business and that's the point I wanted to make and that became apparent when these confidence indexes jumped right after the election; ending the war on success and with lower tax rates, you keep more of what you earn. You're rewarded if you're successful. So I think that accounts for the confidence that's so important. Now, specifically regarding trade, I understand there are some questions and perhaps, some anxieties about trade. I would say as a free trader, that first of all, the president would like to abolish tariffs and non-tariff barriers and subsidies. He is a free trader. But we are stuck with a lot of foreign unfair trading practices, which-</p><p>Costa: How far do you take it?</p><p>Kudlow: Have been harmful to the U.S. workforce and the economy. And I think, Robert, frankly, the principal culprit is China. So how far do you take it? The president has made his statements, using tariffs as a negotiating tool. It's part of his quiver. I don't want to get ahead of the curve. He, I guess, was interviewed a couple of evenings ago and he said, \"Look, if we could reach a deal-a satisfactory deal that helps both sides with China, then the tariffs could be pulled.\" I know that always is his philosophy.</p><p>Costa: What does that mean, a \"satisfactory deal?\"</p><p>Kudlow: On the other hand, if we don't, which includes the intellectual property theft, the forced technology transfers, the lack of ownership, the high tariffs on commodities and industrial supplies, cybersecurity. The whole list, which is very, very important to us. If they don't make a satisfactory offer, then the president will continue to aggressively pursue is agenda and I think he's right to do so. I say that as a free trader. But you can't have free trade with this bill of attainder. China is breaking the rules and we signed at the U.N. a Tripartite Agreement with the E.U., the USA, and Japan, and that agreement was a very important agreement. That agreement lays out the brief against non-market economies, they call it. Read China. And what did I just hear this morning? Did you tell me or somebody told me? The ambassadors to France and Germany were in China-I hope I get this story right-essentially sending that message: \"You must change. You must change.\" </p><p>So how far? I don't want to get ahead of the curve. There will probably be a meeting in Argentina. </p><p>Costa: In Buenos Aires. What's the specific goal of that meeting between President Xi and President Trump. If you're a small business, you're wondering, \"Can they make peace on trade or not?\" </p><p>Kudlow: You know, Robert, I don't know the answer to that. My crystal ball is not at all clear. The agenda is being discussed and worked on inside both camps. I think it will include trade. I'm not 100% sure. I don't want to get ahead of our curve. </p><p>Costa: We're talking about a pull-aside meeting coming up this month coming up with President Xi and President Trump.</p><p>Kudlow: Well, actually, it would be a very formal bilateral sit-down; a very formal one. There was even talk of a meal, lunch or dinner. I don't know. Ambassador Bolton is the lead on that. NEC, Treasury, we're all working very hard. Of course, Ambassador Lighthizer, who has done a great job as our trade rep. I just don't know. I don't know. The president says-I don't know Xi. When he came here, I wasn't in the government so I've never met him. The president says they have good relations, okay? I hope so. We've been to Beijing, they've been to Washington; I think only they can break the logjam. </p><p>Costa: What does it mean for a U.S. business-U.S. small business if the Chinese economy continues to have struggled and it's having its own slide over there?</p><p>Kudlow: I'm not going to deny that there could be some very modest effect and I underscore very modest. </p><p>Costa: On the U.S. economy? </p><p>Kudlow: That's correct. I know a lot of small businesses are import and export. I love that-international trading, supply chains, but we can do it. We are doing it right now without China. Right now, we are doing it without China because we put up a lot of tariffs. I don't know, $250 billion. The 200 is at 10%, the other 50 billion was I think was at 25%, though I call it the \"technology tariff,\" which is very important. No, I think we're growing 3.5% in Q3, as you know, 4.2% in Q2. The fourth quarter change is now 3%, which is a milestone. Our small businesses are soaring; soaring. They're killing it. That's what these charts show and I apologize. I should have put them up on the screen. They're killing it. </p><p>Costa: Should small businesses expect 3% growth next year? </p><p>Kudlow: Yes, yes, Kudlow forecast. Maybe higher. Yes. </p><p>Costa: But that's a baseline for next year?</p><p>Kudlow: That's right. We will put out our budget, Mick Mulvaney and so forth. I don't want to give away the family jewels, but 3% is a good number to think about. People said it couldn't be done. Let's just pause for a second, Robert. I know there's a lot of political stories out there. </p><p>Costa: We're talking about the economy. </p><p>Kudlow: I know, and you've gotten very good at it, really. I've known him for years and I'm impressed. </p><p>Costa: Okay, thank you, Larry. [LAUGHTER] Back to the questions. </p><p>Kudlow: Back to the questions. I believe the biggest story in 2018 is an economic boom that almost everyone said would be impossible. </p><p>Costa: How are you going to bolster wages, though? There are still some nerves about that.</p><p>Kudlow: Let me just tagline that last one because there are a million political events and I understand that and some are more important than others and I owe this to The Washington Post's excellent reporting. A couple of factoids. I just met the woman. I don't want to get her into any trouble.</p><p>Costa: Heather Long. </p><p>Kudlow: But Heather Long wrote this fabulous piece awhile back. Front-page, above the fold, Washington Post is a well-known supply side newspaper. That was a joke. And she noted the explosion of blue-collar jobs. You know what? People hadn't really focused on that, including me, and she went all the way back to Reagan in '84. I was a Reagan Cub Scout economist in the Office of Management and Budget in those days. That's big; that's very big. And the other factoid, which came from another source-probably our own CEA-blue-collar workforce wages are growing faster than the white collar. They're not as high. Don't get me wrong, but they're growing faster. That's extremely unusual and suggests to us that particularly the business tax reforms and tax cuts are really working because Kevin Hassett, my dear friend and CEA chair wrote this piece-I don't know, 10, 15 years ago. I've been using it for years for corporate tax reform. </p><p>The biggest beneficiaries of corporate tax reform are the ordinary workforce and it's kicking in.</p><p>Costa: So, Larry, if the Democrats take over.</p><p>Kudlow: Yes?</p><p>Costa: It's going to be divided government. Would you be willing to consider a deal with a Democrat, a fiscal deal where tax hikes were involved at some level? </p><p>Kudlow: You're asking me personally?</p><p>Costa: Yes.</p><p>Kudlow: Absolutely not.</p><p>Costa: What about President Trump?</p><p>Kudlow: I cannot speak for him. </p><p>Costa: So he hasn't ruled out tax increases as part of a fiscal deal? </p><p>Kudlow: Well, look, we just signed a joint statement with Congress looking for middle-class tax cuts and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady just got a floor vote on the tax cuts 2.0, which would make the individual tax cuts permanent and some other important savings incentives. So you're not seeing this. To look ahead, look what we're doing. Now, look what the president is campaigning on, look what Chairman Brady is talking about. So I can't predict the world. But I will say at the present time, I do not believe we will raise taxes. I do not believe it and if Democrats take the House, a possibility-I would expect tax cuts to be-tax hikes, rather. That's what they're running on. They want to overturn the tax bill. It won't get through the Senate and if it ever did, President Trump would veto it. That's my personal view. It hasn't happened. That's my personal view. The Senate probably would stop tax hikes and if by chance it got through the Senate, President Trump would veto tax hikes.</p><p>Costa: Do you think tax hikes are necessary to address the deficit at some point?</p><p>Kudlow: No, I think we need 10 years or so of economic growth, running about 3% per year. I also think we need to limit spending. You'll see a very tough budget coming from the administration in a couple of months. Again, Mr. Mulvaney.</p><p>Costa: Does that cut Social Security or Medicare?</p><p>Kudlow: It will not, it will not. And I just want to correct-I try to do this to correct the record. I've been trying for months and nobody wants to pick it up. In an interview in New York a while back, there was some confusion. The interviewer was a very bright lady and a friend of mine. She was referring to the two big entitlements. I was referring to the remnants of Obamacare. I said, \"That's where we're going to go, that's where we're going to go.\" And we got tangled up. But no, we have no plans to touch the large entitlements. We do have plans, however, to erase remnants of Obamacare and provide more market-oriented, incentive-oriented healthcare. </p><p>Costa: You've been in the conservative movement for decades. That's been a project for conservatives, trying to pull back long-term federal spending on Social Security and Medicare. Now, you're saying the president, a Republican president won't touch them? </p><p>Kudlow: That's correct. That's his view at the present time and I think you described it aptly. Look, President Trump is a growth guy. President Trump is a growth guy and his view, which I fully, totally, 100% support, is that these tax cut and deregulation policies are working. The economy has picked up. He believes that can go on. He actually tells me all the time, \"We need to have higher growth than 3%.\" We'll take 3. And that has a big impact on the budget. If the CBO is running a baseline of 2% growth or less and we get 3% growth over 10 years, that's roughly, roughly $3.5 trillion reduction in the deficit. </p><p>Now, I'm not saying-there's a lot to reduce. The president has said, \"Non-defense, non-big entitlements. But everything else will be subject to a 5% reduction across the board.\" It may not be even. Some useful programs may rise, but most of them are not. So you'll see that be the toughest budget yet and he's made that statement and they're fleshing it out at OBM. So the combination of lower spending and faster economic growth through the tax cuts is our policy. It's a policy that's working and I think certainly as a share of GDP, the budget deficit will be coming down and each and every year. It clocked in at what? 3.8 or 3.9% of GDP. It actually came in 100 billion less than CBO thought. It's too high. Don't get me wrong, but we're gaining on it.</p><p>Costa: You think the deficit will come down or is the administration committed to having it come down?</p><p>Kudlow: Both, both. I think it will come down because of faster economic growth and I think the administration is committed to policies that will restrain government, in effect. Look, President Trump is, as you know, a very successful former businessman. He doesn't care much for waste. He's going to go after it. His promise-one thing he said a couple weeks ago of a 5% reduction in non-entitlement domestic spending. I can't recall anything quite so tough. And by the way, people will say, \"Well, all the money is in the big entitlements.\" Actually, it's not.</p><p>Costa: There's a lot of money there, though.</p><p>Kudlow: Yes, there is, but there's a lot of money in discretionary programs and smaller entitlements. </p><p>Costa: Your whole argument is to grow the economy and not touch the long-term federal spending programs, touch around the edges. The minimum wage, the Democrats are going to come, if they get any kind of power on Tuesday and say, \"Larry, President Trump, we want a $15.00 federal minimum wage. Is there any way you could go up to that level and cut a deal with us on the minimum wage?\" </p><p>Kudlow: I again, can't speak for the president.</p><p>Costa: But is it possible to cut a deal with the Democrats on the minimum wage?</p><p>Kudlow: My view is no. My view is a federal minimum wage is a terrible idea; a terrible idea and will damage particularly small businesses to force them to take a kind of payroll increase would be silly. Idaho is different than New York, Alabama is different than Nebraska. That's why the federal minimum wage doesn't work for me. Now, a month ago or so-I hope I get this right-Amazon raised its corporation's minimum wage to $15.00? Is that right? Yeah.</p><p>Costa: Amazon's CEO personally owns The Washington Post.           </p><p>Kudlow: Yes. And so people ask me-</p><p>Costa: No, we have to disclose that. [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Kudlow: Yes. </p><p>Costa: Larry brought it up. </p><p>Kudlow: Look, man, it's a supply-side newspaper. </p><p>Costa: That's his opinion. We're a non-partisan newspaper. [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Kudlow: I'm working here. I applauded it. I applauded Mr. Bezos. I applauded it. Great. I'm a Jack Kemp, JFK. My book, JFK and the Reagan Revolution, which is all about tax cuts, which should be bipartisan in my humble opinion. By the way, you can easily get it, JFK and the Reagan Revolution. Just one click on Amazon and you can pick it up. [LAUGHTER] So I applauded the 15% minimum wage. That's a private decision, absolutely. And I want the workforce to grow, prosper. I want wages to soar. I don't think it's inflationary. I don't think more people working and succeeding is inflationary. I've always had that view. Now then people say, well, I guess later on cable TV-Bernie Sanders came out and supported the minimum wage, so people were saying, \"Well, Kudlow and Sanders are agreeing.\" Well, I guess on that topic, we do. But not the federal. And I would argue against state and local but that's up to the states and localities. </p><p>Costa: Speaking of inflation, the Federal Reserve, a lot of public frustration from President Trump about Chairman Powell. Has the president considered replacing Powell as chairman? Keeping him on the Board of Governors but replacing him as chairman? </p><p>Kudlow: No, no. To my knowledge, no. And by the way, it would be an impossible task. Jay Powell is a friend of mine. I don't even want to go down this road, but a Fed chair can only be removed for cause. </p><p>Costa: That's maybe from the Federal Reserve Board but can you install a different chairman? </p><p>Kudlow: I don't think so. It's a four-year term. I'd have to look at the archives on that but I think it's a four-year term. But no, we're not-the president has said, \"We're not going there.\" He has said that. </p><p>Costa: [INDISCERNIBLE]. Has the president ever called Chairman Powell, that you know of, and said, \"Please don't raise the rates?\" </p><p>Kudlow: Not yet. No. The president, as a successful businessman and investor knows a lot about this. He's giving his opinion. He's giving his opinion. Greenspan's book just came out and Alan said, \"One way or the other, talking, notes, phone calls; presidents are always giving the Fed advice.\" President Trump has not made the phone call. But he believes or he's concerned that the Fed is moving its target rate up too high and too rapidly. That's his view. By the way, a lot of distinguished economists hold that view. </p><p>Costa: Has Chairman Powell, though, ever called you up and said, \"Larry, this is too much, this public pressure?\" </p><p>Kudlow: I have lunch with Chairman Powell each month and we swap anecdotes and stories. I was just going to say that I believe the Fed and the administration have similar goals, and that is to say, non-inflationary growth and I think that over time, that will become more and more apparent. And I also will applaud Chairman Powell for breaking out of the mold-\"low unemployment is bad. It's going to cause inflation.\" No, it's not. If dollar collapse, that will cause inflation. Low unemployment-</p><p>Costa: Could the president install a dove on the Fed at some point? </p><p>Kudlow: Well, I believe there are still two appointments to be made, okay? But I don't want to conjecture on that. I don't want to get-</p><p>Costa: But why not put a dove in there? </p><p>Kudlow: Well, look, I don't want to conjecture on it. </p><p>Costa: So the president may be open to it? Someone with a different mindset? </p><p>Kudlow: I don't even want to put words in his mouth on any of that stuff. That's hypothetical, as you know. I hate hypotheticals. But I'm just saying, Jay Powell has said publicly in his speeches that these old Fed models; more people working and low employment is bad. He doesn't buy it. He's said that publicly. He's said we don't know what the natural interest rate is. He's said that publicly. He's said we don't know steady state inflation, why does it have to go above 2? </p><p>So I think he and the president share important goals. That's what I think. But the president has an opinion about this. He's not pushing the Fed. He's not trying to drive through their independence. He's said that. He's not saying, \"Change.\" He's not making calls, this and that. He's not disrupting their independence. He has said that several times and I believe that myself. He's just giving his opinion. </p><p>Costa: Since we're here at The Washington Post, our colleague, Jamal Khashoggi killed in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. </p><p>Kudlow: Yes, tragic. Terrible, tragic. </p><p>Costa: What should the economic ramifications be for the Saudi royal family? </p><p>Kudlow: Oh, I don't know. By the way, again, a tragedy. An absolute tragedy, terrible story. So as you know, the investigations are ongoing and as you also know, the Saudi royal family has actually changed their tune quite a bit and now acknowledges that Khashoggi is dead.              It took a while to get that out.              So President Trump has said many times, \"Let's wait and see what the investigations produce, facts.              And then consider potential options or not.\"              We've got to get the facts fully on the table.          </p><p>Costa: What do you think about that arms deal? Should it continue? The $110 billion arms deal President Trump talks about? It is necessary for the economy?</p><p>Kudlow: The president has said many times he would like that. But he's also said, \"Everything is on hold pending this investigation.\" </p><p>Costa: We only have a few minutes left, a couple of minutes left. You say you're a supply-sider. </p><p>Kudlow: Yes.</p><p>Costa: You've had a long-time support for immigration in this country and you talked about how the closing message maybe from your view should be the economy. President Trump is focusing a lot on immigration. Do you personally agree with him that birth-right citizenship should be ended?</p><p>Kudlow: Well, I'm not a constitutional scholar. Some people I know and respect are and believe that the 14th Amendment deals with that but I'm not a scholar, okay? I do think many of these illegal practices have to be curtailed, okay? And I am pro-immigration; always have been. But I'm pro-legal immigration. The system is broken. The system has been broken for quite some time and it needs to be fixed. The president has made, as you know, a number of proposals to fix that system; on border security and different-stop at the border, sanctuary cities, a whole program of merit points to come into the United States, which many countries successfully use. I agree with that. I agree with all that and the trouble is Congress never passes it. </p><p>So yeah, I'm a supply-sider and I'm a free market guy and I believe in the free flow of labor and capital. I think that benefits growth but I also believe in legal, sovereign borders and a legal immigration system. </p><p>Costa: Final question, Larry: how long do you plan to stay in this job? </p><p>Kudlow: [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Costa: Is that the answer? [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Kudlow: I serve at the president's pleasure, as you know. I love this job. Most days, it's the most fun I've ever had. Honestly, the most fun.</p><p>Costa: Keyword: most?</p><p>Kudlow: Most days. You have your bad days. Aaron Judge will have a bad day or two, the Yankee home run hitter. But the answer is I love the job. The answer is the president has been great to me, open, accessible, see him all the time. I love the work at the National Economic Council. We're involved in domestic and international policies across the board. I love the committee work. I'm diligent in doing it. I love helping out in the media. It's just a wonderful job. It's just like a dream job. My wife said to me when this came and the president was calling us back in March and we were considering it, she said, \"You've been training 40 years for that job.\" And my saintly wife is probably right. That I've been in the government, OMB, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street. I've been a broadcaster 15, 20 years, radio and TV. You study the issues, you see it from different perspectives. </p><p>Costa: But you don't have a timeline in mind? </p><p>Kudlow: I do not, I do not. I feel great. I just love my job. I mean, I love my job. If I was in that NFIB optimism index, I'd be part of the up line. It really is the most fun I've ever had. </p><p>Costa: Thank you, Larry. Larry Kudlow, National Economic Council director. Thank you.</p><p>[APPLAUSE] </p><p>             Navigating the small business landscape:          </p><p>Long: Good morning. My name is Heather Long, and I am an economics correspondent here at The Washington Post. We're excited to continue this discussion about small business with two actual small business owners and two others who are on the frontlines of setting small business policy in this country. I'll start by introducing our great panel. Just to my left here is Tom Sullivan, the vice president of small business policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Next to him is Mallory Shelter, a small business owner who just six weeks ago opened a store here in Washington D.C. called SHELTER. It's a wonderful jewelry store in the Union Market area of the city. She has been a creator and designer of jewelry for several years and finally took the plunge to open the business in a brick-and-mortar context. Next to her is Gary Williams, a creator and photographer. He is cofounder of Creative Theory, a social consulting content creation firm that he started with a partner in 2015. We're excited to have you here and you already won best shoes. [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Williams: Ah, thank you. Thank you. </p><p>Shelter: Hey, come on. </p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>Williams: I appreciate that. </p><p>Long: It's a competition. We'll vote later. [LAUGHTER] And last but certainly not least is Allen Gutierrez, an associate administrator for the Office of Entrepreneurial Development at the U.S. Small Business Administration and he's been traveling the country speaking to small business owners and working to help launch small businesses in this country.</p><p> So I thought I would kick it off by asking each of you to reflect a little bit about why we don't have more small businesses in this country. What people may not know is small business creation and new business creation is actually at a 30-year low in the United States right now. It fell pretty sharply during the recession, and it just hasn't bounced back which has really many people; and there's a lot of theories about why it is that we aren't seeing more new business formation in the United States. So I'd like to start. Maybe Mallory will start with you since it's so fresh; you just started a business. You are bucking the trend. What was the one or two big hurdles for you to really get going?</p><p>Shelter: Yeah. Well, I was running my business online for a very long time, so it was just me and we were speaking earlier about going to a physical location as a much different beast to deal with. I would say definitely access to capital was a huge hurdle for me. I didn't even need that much of it, but that was-</p><p>Long: So are we talking like $10,000 to $50,000.</p><p>Shelter: No, a little more.</p><p>Long: A little more? Okay. </p><p>Shelter: That was really difficult because you have to cover the build-out and inventory buying and a lot of up-front costs to get that started, and I think a lot of people just don't have access to that. I was very lucky that I was able to get a business loan, but I think that that's historically been hard for people. Then finding talent I really struggled with as well. Having people who are willing to work in a small business and go through all of those ups and downs that come with working for a small business and be the jack of all trades, I feel like there is sometimes little payoff for it. And I think just finding the right people to work with, that's been a struggle. I'm lucky that I now have people, but that was definitely a struggle for me. </p><p>Long: And how many people have you hired just in the last few weeks. </p><p>Shelter: Seven.</p><p>Long: Wow, okay. </p><p>M: Wow.</p><p>[APPLAUSE]</p><p>Long: True job creation _________.</p><p>Shelter: Yes, they're all fantastic. Thank you. [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Long: I forgot to say that you can tweet us questions from the audience here or online; all you have to do is use the hashtag #PostLive, one word, #PostLive, and we'll throw some of those at the panel later on. Gary, what about you? What were some of the big hurdles for you?</p><p>Williams: For us it's different. Obviously we're a creative consulting company and creation service, so we don't really need capital in that sense; we don't need a brick-and-mortar; we don't need a storefront. We needed an office space, and for that's not a heavy lift as is raising the capital you need to start a brick-and-mortar. So I think for us the main hurdle was the paperwork and starting an LLC and getting all that done and then getting a good accountant and things of that nature. And a lot of creatives that we talk to in our industry, they just-it's a daunting task. Right? They don't necessarily feel like they can do it or have the bandwidth to do it or know the right people who can lead them the right way as far as accounting and getting your paperwork legit. So for us it wasn't necessarily a hurdle; it was just a buckle down and, \"Let's do the right things we need to do to make this an official business,\" and then take it one step at a time from there.</p><p>Long: And where did you get that help from? Was that from friends?</p><p>Williams: Yeah, so my business partner and I have been working in the industry before we were even together in business for a while, so we've made great relationships across the board, and so we just reached out to our network. We have a huge network here in D.C., one being EDENS, which is a very big developer and one of our clients, and they are amazing and have been a great source for us. If we need something and they can't provide it, they know somebody who can. So we just tapped our resources, again, which a lot creative don't have those resources. We were fortunate enough to know people that could help us out. </p><p>Long: Tom, let's throw it to you. What one or two policy changes at maybe either the state level or at the federal level do you think could really jumpstart business creation in the United States again?</p><p>Sullivan: Well, I think first of all, Heather, we're seeing record-breaking confidence in small business. We run a quarterly survey of 1,000 small business owners, and for six consecutive quarters they have said that they are confident with the economy. And so as far as reversing a 30-year trend of declining entrepreneurship we believe that confidence breads more folks like Mallory and like Gary who want to plunge into entrepreneurship. So we're very optimistic, kind of like most small business owners, and we think that the reason for this confidence are a lot of the things that Larry Kudlow just talked about, and those are pro-growth policies like tax cuts, regulatory reform, and others. So as much as we can have the policy wind at entrepreneur's backs I think we will see a reverse in the decline of entrepreneurship. </p><p>Long: Great. And what about those paperwork or capital concerns? Are you hearing that a lot when you go around the country? Is that still a big hurdle for a lot of potential new business owners?</p><p>Sullivan: We are except it's lower on the concern list than it has been. I think Larry had mentioned NFIB and the work that they do to survey small businesses. They had said that tax compliance and tax burden for the first time in over 30 years has fallen off the top five issues of concern. So they're still there-regulatory, paperwork, tax compliance-it's just they're lower the concern list than they used to be. Hiring employees is now number one, and so we've got a lot of small businesses from around the country that are jealous of Mallory who can hire seven people in six weeks. </p><p>Long: Allen, what about you? What do you think some of the best policies the Trump administration has done so far to try to reverse this 30-year trend?</p><p>Gutierrez: Certainly. First of all, I'd like to say today is the start of National Entrepreneurship Month, so happy birthday to all those entrepreneurs out there. Certainly that's what is the engine of this economy, from starting and having an idea and growing it to fruition like Mallory and Gary. I would say that one of the things, that Administrator Linda McMahon had been on her Ignite Tour, and one of the things that she has been recognizing and looking at, getting all the feedback from the different entrepreneurs and business owners of what is really helping them. </p><p> In terms of the feedback that we're getting is that obviously like Tom was saying, you know, the less tax regulation, the opportunity to be able to be able to then use those additional funds to be able to potentially hire new individuals which would potentially buy new machinery that will take you to the next level. One example would be a gentleman down in Miami that had mentioned he had a brewery company. And he's like, \"Look; with this tax cuts I'm able to buy an additional machinery that will help me in providing more of my brewery but also in return also to bring more employees on board as well. Those are the things that we're hearing out there in that aspect that are refreshing and good.</p><p> I think that Tom had mentioned the confidence level. With the confidence level, certainly there is an opportunity to a little bit more of a risk. Right? Factor in that aspect. So what we say and what we would like to say from SBA, we're here to help. We're here to help you start, grow, and expand your business. And that's one of the many things that we're doing at SBA under the leadership of Administrator McMahon. </p><p>Long: And what's your top priority for 2019? It seems like a lot of things. Confidence is up, but what else are you aiming to do and hoping to do in the coming months. </p><p>Gutierrez: Sure. A couple of things that we're looking at certainly we recognize the opportunity to expand even more in rural America, to really provide those tools and services. Recent examples that we have done is for example our new MOU with the USDA Department of Agriculture and how we can maximize each other's resources to be able to reach out to the entrepreneurs and small businesses in rural America. Also looking at workforce development too. One of the things that we're going to be rolling out in the near future that will work in a public-private partnership in that aspect to working with colleges and private sectors. And, you know, the president yesterday mentioned about working more with private sector and their role as well in terms of workforce development but also how we can work together as a team. </p><p>Long: Hmm. Let's stay on taxes for a second. Gary, you've owned your business for a couple of years now. Have you felt the tax changes at all?</p><p>Williams: Again, for us it's different. We definitely have, but I don't think on the scale that most larger businesses or maybe Mallory feels. So for us-and we have a really good accountant-[LAUGHTER]</p><p>Shelter: Same. It's key.</p><p>Williams: Yeah, it's key. So for us we've been able to make adjustments and kind of-I won't say fight off, but you know, just make adjustments necessary to withstand those policy changes. And so it hasn't been a very huge factor for us, but, again, we are in the very infancy stages of our business, and I imagine as we scale these will become larger issues for us, and we'll be reaching out to one of these guys to help us out.</p><p>Long: Does it enable you to do anything-I don't know-buy new machines or buy a new camera?</p><p>Williams: Yeah, yeah, always. We do buy equipment. We try to stay up to date. As you know, this is a very technology-driven field, and so if you don't have the latest equipment you are kind of behind. And so for us we try to renew our equipment yearly, and there are incentives for that as far as tax breaks and things like that, putting the money back into the business. And so we do feel a relief there. </p><p> Long: What about you, Mallory? Was that at all a factor as you look to expand?</p><p>Shelter: It's definitely something I take into consideration. I've been lucky to have a profit in my business, but seeing that money be put aside for taxes can hurt sometimes. </p><p>M: Yes.</p><p>Shelter: So I wouldn't say that I feel it as much, but it's definitely something that I am constantly thinking about because every time-you know, you're not getting a paycheck from another person and that's automatically taken out. I have to account for my employee taxes and my income tax and my sales tax and all of those things that I need to pull from my business every month to pay, so it's very much top of mind. </p><p>Long: Tom, do we need another tax cut? The president has floated the idea that maybe he would like to do another, and I think he said 10% for the middle class and that some of that could be for small business owners. Is that needed, or have we done enough to really stimulate the economy?</p><p>Sullivan: Well, the lens we always look through at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is growth. And we see growth happening right now with the tax cuts that happened around Christmas time last year, and we have yet to see whether or not additional tax cuts are required to keep the three percent growth going in the economy. There are a couple of things though that are important in the small business tax world. A lot of these incentives that Gary and Mallory talked about, they might be going away after 2025. And so the House passed legislation that would make those permanent. We had several hundred small businesses here for our summit just earlier last month, the first week of October, and many of them went to Capitol Hill and they asked Congress, \"Make those tax cuts permanent.\" And so I'm not sure if that meets the definition of additional tax cuts, but it's certainly a priority for the small businesses we talk with. </p><p>Long: And you really think that would be a game changer to make those permanent?</p><p>Sullivan: I think so. I mean, like many folks, small business owners would like to have the luxury of planning multiple years ahead so when they're making investment decisions on whether they want to grow their storefront or expand their technology they want to be able to look past next month; they want to look past next year, and the ability for them to plan past 2025 and count on certain parts of the tax code, tax code changes, is very important. </p><p>Long: I'd like to turn to healthcare. I'm actually surprised nobody has mentioned it yet. That seems to be one, when I go around the country, something that a lot of people want to talk about who are small business owners or even if they're not about cost rising. Mallory, maybe we'll start with you. How are you handling healthcare costs?</p><p>Shelter: Well, I am lucky that I can get it through my husband's company because I truly don't know what I would do if that weren't the case. It's something I think about a lot to provide to my employees, and it's a huge financial burden to me. So right now I have part-time employees and I don't provide that to them, but to retain talent and to get new people to work for you I think it's something that I have considered offering, and it's one of those things I don't even know where to start on.</p><p>Long: Hmm. You mean who to go to ask, how to structure this, what are my options?</p><p>Shelter: Who to go to ask, yeah, exactly. </p><p>Long: Gary, what are you all doing?</p><p>Williams: So I'm fortunate to be on my wife's healthcare, but that's the nature of the business. Right? Obviously, like I talk about scale, we are still in the infancy stage of our business, but scaling that will be something that we'll have to tackle. Obviously we want to be able to provide healthcare for our employees when the time comes, but when you look at all that that entails it's daunting. It's expensive. But, again, I'm fortunate to be on my wife's. And even when I didn't have this business I was working for myself as an entrepreneur it's expensive. It says Affordable Healthcare Act, and I was affording it but at a cost. It was expensive. And so a lot of times I would get paid and a majority of the chunk of that would go to my healthcare, and we're not even talking about great healthcare; we're just talking about bare-minimum healthcare. And so when you talk about healthcare there is a difference between healthcare and then good healthcare. </p><p>Obviously, when we scale and when we grow our business we want to provide good healthcare for our employees. I don't know where to start, like Mallory says, but when that time comes, again, I will be looking to these guys to help. But that will be an important task for us when that time comes.</p><p>Long: Yeah. Allen, what's your take on this? What are some of the initiatives at SBA to try to make things more affordable?</p><p>Gutierrez: I would say that certainly the president has been a true champion for small business, and we see it every day in terms of not only from less regulation but also the tackling of the healthcare challenge. For me, I used to be in corporate and the healthcare industry, and I remember those days where you have your clients that would have an increase of maybe two to three percent on their renewal, and that was a kind of a, you know-like Tom mentioned, small business wants to forecast and see where it is for next year, you know, budgets and planning and so forth. But these recent years have been a spike so much that it really has affected the bottom line for small business and also affecting on the terms of the type of plans. And I think from the leadership of the president, certainly with association health plans it's something that will really help in that aspect of really pooling small businesses together in that opportunity to lower that opportunity and keep the benefits at an optimum level. So from us, from SBA, we don't present the policy from that standpoint, but certainly we do hear that and Administrator McMahon does hear that, that healthcare is also-they tell us, \"great on less regulation, less burden, less paperwork, but healthcare is still a big challenge for us,\" and certainly looking at these areas in terms of the association health plans, I think, is a right step in the right direction. </p><p>Long: Now, a lot of people may not know what an association health plan is. Could you just say a minute on-</p><p>Gutierrez: Sure, just real quickly in terms of you as a small business, like Gary goes in and goes for a health insurance plan, the risk is going to be affiliated only with his pool of employees. So let's say 10 employees. But if you put all together, all of us have each an individual business and we have 10 employees together, that we'd come together as a plan and then there's an ability for the healthcare industry to give you a plan to all of us that spreads the risk. Right? So it lowers the cost in that opportunity. And that's what is beneficial for a small business owner because then they're able to forecast and realize that it's not going to be such a burden to them on their bottom line approach. </p><p>Long: I just want to point out that it is controversial. Several states are suing the administration over this change. Some states don't allow these types of plans. And what Gary was speaking of earlier, one of the big concerns is that some of these plans may not offer what is considered good healthcare or what is considered a federally acceptable level of healthcare. So this is very much fresh in the debate right now, so I'm glad you brought it up. Tom, jump in. </p><p>Sullivan: Well, thank you. The U.S. Chamber is really, really excited about association health plans because we work with 1,600 state and local chambers of commerce, and as recently as this month and last month they have been offering association health plans to their small business members. So Las Vegas Metro Chamber of Commerce was one of the first in, then other chambers in Nevada jumped in. Lubbock, Texas just went online with their association health plans. Just yesterday we saw a group of chambers of commerce in North Texas that are offering association health plans. And even the National Association of Realtors which represents 1.3 million realtors is looking at an association health plan.</p><p>Long: And how do you all respond to that big criticism that what would be offered under those plans is not acceptable, it doesn't meet the federal requirements, maybe things like mental health or pregnancy even may not be covered?</p><p>Sullivan: Well, unfortunately, Heather, we think that the rhetoric about that is part of fake news. We actually believe that Secretary Acosta crafted the association health plan rule in a way that makes sure that all the protections under the Affordable Care Act extend to the association health plans. He was very careful in writing it that way, and so the discussion about skimpy plans, preexisting conditions, all those things, we unfortunately think that those aren't accurate and also believe that if you follow the models that are happening in these state and local chambers of commerce and you talk with them about the offerings you'll actually find out that this is an exciting opportunity to help provide guidance to folks like Gary and Mallory.</p><p>Long: I think that's what's tricky, is that they become so many different plans so you're trying to navigate. It could be very different from one community to the next in terms of what's being offered, but it's certainly a hot issue, and we'll see how it evolves particularly in the courts. I think that's a big question mark. If you're a small business owner, do you join this right now, join one of these plans when it could be challenged legally or overturned? We'll see what happens next year. </p><p> Let's turn to hiring. Everybody has been very excited that Mallory has added some new employees. And I know Gary works with a number of contractors on different projects you were saying that you're engaged in. Everybody is telling us it's super hard to find workers now. How did you do it? </p><p>Shelter: Instagram.</p><p>Long: No kidding.</p><p>Shelter: Yeah, it's a challenge. In D.C. in particular I've struggled because I don't-you know, Tom and I were talking earlier, and I don't think there is that creative economy that's as strong as other larger cities. And then again I'm offering a part-time retail position, which isn't always the most glamorous, so I've been fortunate to find people. I have a lot of people who are working this in addition to other jobs to either maintain their lifestyle and be able to afford to live in D.C. or because they're looking for a creative outlet on top of a nine-to-five job that maybe isn't providing that. So I've been fortunate to find those people, but I am always fearful that someone will leave or I'll be short-staffed, so it's something that is on my mind pretty much every day.</p><p>Long: And what about wages? You know, D.C. is an expensive city. We see other companies, Amazons, even the Walmarts of the world raising their pay. Is it difficult for a small business owner like you to compete with that? How do you set wages? </p><p>Shelter: It is. It's one of the things that I can do to maintain talent, so I pay more than the minimum wage because I think that that's fair, and I also acknowledge that D.C. is an incredibly expensive place to live. And I'm lucky that I'm able to do that, but, again, that comes out of my bottom line of costs. It's a huge expense every two weeks when I go to run payroll. It's a big expense for me, b I also want to be fair with the women who work for me. </p><p>Long: Do you have any concerns? Larry Kudlow and the panel before was asked about raising the minimum wage, raising the federal minimum wage which has been at $7.25 an hour for many years now, over a decade. Is there a concern that you would have if it went to a certain level? A lot of people are pushing for $15. Would that make any difference to you?</p><p>Shelter: That's what I pay right now, so no. </p><p>Long: Okay. So you think it's doable?</p><p>Shelter: Yes.</p><p>Long: Well, Allen, what about you and this whole debate? If the minimum wage goes up can the economy handle that? </p><p>Gutierrez: I'll leave that to another division of our executive branch to get back to you on that, but I would say from the standpoint, what we're seeing and I mentioned about our leader, our great leader and champion Administrator McMahon, she's already been in less than a year already has visited 44 states and meeting with all entrepreneurs and small businesses. And that has been a reoccurring that we've been hearing, you know, access and opportunity to hire more. I mean, it's in a way a good problem to have as opposed to we have a low unemployment rate, a lowest in the Hispanic community, lowest in the African American community, but what can we do to really be there as an agency, as SBA, to assist. And that's what I mentioned in terms of looking at in the upcoming year some of the initiatives that we're looking at potentially for workforce development and partnerships, that we really recognize in looking at not only urban but also rural that will offset, and we're looking forward to announcing that very soon. </p><p>Long: And would you say that's the number-one issue you're hearing, is this trouble finding workers?</p><p>Gutierrez: It's at the top. Like Tom mentioned, you know, now you've got less regulation, less cost per employee in a good direction. We're not there yet. It still costs around $10,000 per employee in the small business where a larger employer can absorbed that. Right? So we always want it lower the better, but I would say that area in terms of workforce development is key for us in that aspect. </p><p>Long: And can you give a hint of what's coming? Is it more physical centers on the ground or more-</p><p>Gutierrez: Well, I would say part of it-like through my division in Entrepreneur Development Office is looking at maximizing our three lanes, our resource partners that I have that are external, and also looking at extending new partnerships and new strategic alliances, as mentioned in the past with colleges and private sector and so forth, to really make it a win-win for everybody.</p><p>Long: Tom, I want to throw it back to you. We haven't talked about tariff, but that definitely pops up on the list that a number of small business owners I have talked to around the country are concerned about. They aren't able to negotiate prices like a larger company can. How concerned are you that we've got potentially more tariffs coming on Chinese products? </p><p>Sullivan: Well, we're very concerned. I mean, we've talked about a major headwind for small business, which is finding qualified and willing employees. We view a trade war as another one of those headwinds. Like you said, Heather, the small businesses don't have the luxury of looking five to seven years out and cutting the contracts with suppliers. Small business owners are much more beholden to price changes, so they would like very much for the negotiations and the tariffs to lead to certainty and to trade deals. The longer this goes on I think the worse it off it is for small businesses. </p><p>Long: Yeah, because they can't absorb those costs.</p><p>Sullivan: Correct.</p><p>Long: Now, do you think they're going to start passing those costs along to consumers? Are you starting to hear people say, \"Look, I can't afford to pay for higher costs for steel or aluminum. I'm going to need to charge more for my products\"?</p><p>Sullivan: Well, we were visiting with Traci and Lori Tapani up in Minnesota a couple of months ago, and they do a sheet metal fabricating. They're already passing along their costs to their customers, their supply chain, so it's already happening. Whether it's boiled down to the consumers only the data will tell that, but the cost escalation is already happening, and we're pretty scared that that be a headwind that will detract from the growth that we're seeing.</p><p>Long: Yeah. Well, to wrap it up we've only got a few seconds but Gary and Mallory, what's the best part about being a small business owner in Washington D.C.</p><p>Shelter: You go first.</p><p>Williams: For us-</p><p>Long: Other than good shoes, obviously. [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Williams: Yeah, yeah, yeah. For us as a company we started out obviously very involved in the D.C. creative community, and one of our main goals was to represent underrepresented communities in the D.C. area that we knew were creative, talented, and deserved a shot. And so we work on a contract-base business, so project-wise. We get a project once a month or something like that, we try to bring in or source from the local D.C. community to add value to these projects. So just last week we wrapped up a huge project with YouTube where we were able to hire and source 20-plus D.C. creatives and entrepreneurs for this project. And so for us that is the major thing, being able to uplift your community and give underrepresented communities opportunities like this to work with Fortune 500 companies. That's a huge benefit to us and that's kind of where we hang our hat. </p><p>Long: Well, that's pretty inspiring. All right, Mallory. Wrap us up. </p><p>Shelter: [OVERLAPPING] I think in D.C. as a city it's starting to experience a little bit more of a creative renaissance, so I think people in the area are really excited for new businesses. I'm lucky my store is located in the Union Market district where there's a lot of up-and-coming businesses opening up and people are just thrilled to have local retail offerings. I think on a larger level I am able to support other businesses. I carry over 30 female-run jewelry brands in my store, and I am honored to be able to support them and bring them into my store and offer them the opportunity for their work to be seen by other people, so that's pretty amazing that I can. As a jewelry designer and now a storeowner, I'm honored that I can help these people out as well. </p><p>Long: Neat. Well, look out New York and L.A.; D.C. is coming with the creative stuff. [LAUGHTER] Well, thank you so much for your insights today and stay tuned for the healthcare panel next, key topic.</p><p>[APPLAUSE]</p><p>             Content from Kaiser Permanente:          </p><p>Connolly: Well, good morning, everyone. I am Ceci Connolly. I am the president and CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. I also happen to be a former Washington Post reporter, so what a treat that they let me back in the building, huh, Tom? We're going to talk a little bit about health, health as a business strategy, and I'm thrilled to have here joining me today Tom Carter. He is the national vice president of the Workforce Health Consulting Group at Kaiser Permanente, and full disclosure, Kaiser Permanente is one of our members at ACHP, and so I think we share a lot of the same values and perspectives on this topic. </p><p> But I wanted to start a little bit, now that I am in this different role, I suddenly find myself as a chief executive of a small business. We have 21 employees, and I worry about the cost of health insurance; I worry what do I do with such a small staff, if people are out sick, or taking their kids to a doctor and that sort of thing. So, it's definitely on my mind in terms of the cost of health, but why should I care about wellbeing, and the wellbeing of my employees? So, I've got a lot on my mind. </p><p>Carter: Yeah, well, that's a great question, and the movement that's happened over a lot of different years is thinking about-we used to think a lot about health as an insurance decision or a benefits buy. To attract and retain your talent, you have to have a good benefits package and things like that, and it was basically to indemnify people from a financial risk if they needed to go see the doctor. Now we're realizing that people have to be engaged in their health, personally, and their healthcare, and that there's actually a proactive approach to that, and the benefit of that is if you have a healthy workforce, it's much like having a safe environment, or a safe workforce. </p><p> Today, we would never tolerate an unsafe work environment. We've learned many years ago with the formation of OSHA and other organizations that help us create a safe work environment. Now we realize that a healthy work environment is as critical as creating a safe work environment. So, when you think about a healthy work environment, it's not just the physical health and nutrition that we typically kind of put in a box about thinking of health; wellbeing is more about the social, financial. A lot of people are struggling financially in this country. They have student debt, student loans, new employees coming in, so there's lot of distractions around that. </p><p> There's also a sense of community and purpose that really rounds out your feeling, personally, and so at work, the small employer especially needs to engage their workforce in a way that finds out exactly how people want to be supported at work. We heard Mallory describe it's hard hiring people right now, everywhere. And so, when you do get these employees in, you want to retain them, which means they want to be treated the way they want to be treated, and if they don't like the environment, they'll go to another organization, other employer. So, really focusing on them will get you a long way. </p><p>Connolly: So, Tom, I just want to underscore for everyone joining us here, and out in the worldwide web land, we're talking wellbeing. It used to be a while ago, the term was wellness, and so I really-you touched on it, but why is that language change important? </p><p>Carter: Yeah. Wellness was-and I've been around, as you can tell by the color of my hair, a long time, and the move from wellness, it's been around for a number of years, and it was viewed more as a product strategy. You have to offer a wellness program, or a wellness product, or something along those lines, and it's not that easy. It's not that narrow, and so the evidence has shown that the wellbeing aspect incorporates the physical and the nutrition side, which is what wellness was focused on, because not everybody was motivated to be quote-unquote healthy, as it relates to moving more or eating better. </p><p> And so, we had to incorporate those other aspects of wellbeing, which is what are the things that are in the way of somebody making changes in their life, that would benefit them both personally, healthy-wise, and also benefit them at work? People enjoy most of the-as we heard earlier, they enjoy their jobs, typically, and they want it to be interesting and rewarding for them personally. And if you're unhealthy or distracted due to something that's happening in your life, you're not going to be as happy at work, or as happy personally. And so, the wellbeing movement is broadening the discussion to help employers think more holistically about the role of an employee and how we want to support them at work. </p><p>Connolly: So, especially for a small business that clearly doesn't have the resources of large companies that might put entire teams onto something like this, do you have a few low-cost or even no-cost strategies that people can start with? </p><p>Carter: Yeah, this is not about buying the shiny object, as we were talking earlier. The movement in the digital space and others, there are now well over 70,000 digital applications that consumers are faced with that are all healthy apps. And so, buying an app or even an employer thinking of some digital solution that's going to help everybody is not the place to start. It might help some but helping everybody means that the first thing-the easy, low-cost thing is to engage and have a conversation with your employees about what motivates them, what are they interested in, things like that. </p><p> I've heard a lot of small employers talk about encouraging people to move more, and so we have walking meetings. You could describe certain things. Believe it or not, a lot of people are still thinking very traditionally, like I've got to show up, I've got to sit at my desk, or stand at the counter, and I'm going to do my job all day. And we know that's not good for you. Some people stand all day, so they need a place to sit and relax. Other people sit all day, and they need to stand up and move more. And so, just thinking differently about what your environment looks like, how you run a meeting, how you serve-if you are feeding your employees at work, what are you feeding them at work. </p><p>Kaiser Permanente, years ago, I think I gained 15 pounds when I first joined Kaiser because we even were-we were bringing people in and we were not necessarily feeding them the best food during long meetings, and all of a sudden, I'm looking around going-I didn't do this to myself. I feel like Kaiser contributed to my weight problem, so it was codependency. But I needed to take accountability so there was obviously some movement there, but more importantly, we changed the way we ran meetings. We changed the way we brought in food. We put guidelines in about what kind of food should we bring in to our employees that would support their health at work? </p><p> We defined what a healthy meeting, as far as what-allowing people to go outside the building and walk was okay. You didn't have to be tied to your desk all day, so if you want to have a-if you and I were having a one on one meeting, it's okay to go walk around for a half an hour, and then come back. And so, those are some easy things. Smoke-free campuses-believe it or not, smoking is still a problem in parts of our country, significantly, and people don't even think about just putting in a policy that says, at work, we want to have a smoke-free campus. If you're going to smoke, you can go two and a half miles down the street and have your break and come back. Make it a little challenging, but more importantly, just bringing attention to that, and just letting people know that it's not something I want to endorse at work. </p><p> And so, now if you want to quit smoking, let me help you with that, and there's ways I can engage you, but not having a smoke-free campus or smoke-free policy is limiting for people. They think it's okay, then, to smoke at work, go out back. </p><p>Connolly: So, in all of your work with so many different employers around building a culture of health, give me a couple of the surprises, the things that have percolated up that maybe you weren't-the walking and the food, I think we can all sort of follow that pretty logically, but what else? </p><p>Carter: There were-and this all has come from the small business community that we've been partnering with. There were small-I remember a real estate-a brokerage firm that sells money for you to buy a house, and when they started on this journey, the simple things they did, and the benefit to their business was pretty amazing. The first thing was the flu season was coming on, so there's some really easy things like educating people about either flu shots, which not everybody wants to do, but I'll tell you, the evidence is in that the flu shots work. So, kind of destigmatizing that, getting people to wash their hands during-so they don't spread diseases at work-colds, flus. </p><p>Connolly: Put that sanitizer right out on the conference room table. </p><p>Carter: Put it out there. Water-believe it or not, having a water container with the big jug of water, it reminds people to stay hydrated during the day, which is another easy thing to do. I had an employer tell me that they notice when they put the water cooler in, that it took about a minute and a half to fill a water bottle. And so, they thought, well, as long as I have them there for a minute and a half, they started to put up pictures of what a healthy plate of food looked like, just visual. Half of it-believe it or not-half of it has to be green, which is a good reminder, or some colorful thing, not just potatoes and rice and meat. </p><p> And so, they started to put up pictures, and all of a sudden, the infamous water cooler talk started to change about did you notice that picture? How have you changed the way you're eating? The other thing that I heard from the mortgage broker was about a refrigerator. People, when he asked, \"What could I do to help you with your own personal habits to stay healthy?\" People said, \"I want to bring my own food to work, and you don't have a refrigerator, so I can't. You're keeping me from doing that.\" So, he bought a refrigerator. Those were all things that-and even the employees, I believe at this one, kicked in a little money to help him buy the refrigerator. He didn't have a lot of money, and actually, people will contribute to things that are good for them. </p><p>Connolly: Well, and I hear from our team here, because in Washington, D.C., lunch is expensive. It's not even like you can just go pick up a sandwich for a couple of bucks, and so, in your definition of wellbeing, which can also include financial wellbeing, some sort of security, just being able to bring your lunch may be saving you $10, $11 a day in Washington, D.C.. So, let's really tie it now, Tom, to hard, brass tacks. We are business people still at the end of the day; can you identify ROI on these sorts of activities? </p><p>Carter: So, I'll extend the ROI to return on value and return on effort. So, the return on investment, a lot of people look to try to reconcile that on a balance sheet. The benefit that we hear when people are focused on supporting the health of their workforce is it shows up in a couple of different ways. One is imagine having 10 employees or even 5 employees, and whoever the key employee is goes down unnecessarily due to a health condition that maybe could have been avoided. That's a 10- or a 20% impact on your workforce, so imagine the productivity, depending on who that individual is, if it's a critical employee, imagine that position going down for an extended period of time, what that would do to your business. </p><p> So, that's the first thing, trying to avoid that from happening. Stuff happens out there, we know that, but if you can help-what we want to try to do is help small businesses understand that when you make this investment in supporting the health of your workforce, you will reduce the risk of that happening for those kinds of conditions. And so, that's one thing is it's definitely impacting productivity. The other one was I've heard employers describe customer experience, that the customers working with you recognize that your employees feel better about themselves; on the phone, they're happier; they aren't as stressed out sounding. </p><p>Connolly: Less stressed. </p><p>Carter: Exactly, it shows up in the way you talk to your-we all survive based on customers purchasing our services, so when the customers recognize that, that was actually number two was the customer's experience, and then the morale of your employees. Again, back to retention, it's very expensive, as you know, for turnover. And so, if you can impact the retention of your workforce in a way that keeps people there, supported the way they want to be supported, that's also a form of return on investment or return on value that you don't have as much turnover, which is very expensive. </p><p>Connolly: Great. In our remaining moment, I want to let everyone know, at our ACHP twitter handle we're going to push out this morning a neat little fun animated video on wellbeing. Feel free to check it out, share it with your staff, start a little conversation going, right, Tom? And Tom, if folks leave here today feeling maybe even just a little bit inspired by this, I hope, a little bit hopeful, what's one thing that they could just go and get started even this week? </p><p>Carter: First of all, think simple. Think easy. As I mentioned earlier, the first place to start is not to go find the shiny objects or to buy something to bring into your workforce. The first place to start is have a meeting or bring a few key people into your world, and start asking them these questions: is there anything I'm doing as an employer, or that would impact how you feel about the workplace or the work you do? Find out what their interests are, find out what they're worried about-it could be financial, it could be aging parents, it could be sick kids, and see if there's something you could do as an employer, or to partner with them, or bring in-there's a lot of free resources out there in the community that you could either map people to, or bring in to the workplace. </p><p> And so, it's just the one thing would be, be more aware about how health is impacting your business and connect with your workers in a way that you get feedback, so you know where to start, because they'll give you some great advice. </p><p>Connolly: Great. Please join me in thanking Tom Carter, Kaiser Permanente. Thank you, Tom. I believe I am turning it back over to The Washington Post. </p><p>[APPLAUSE]</p><p>             One-on-one with Bluemercury's Marla Beck:          </p><p>Casey: All right. Good morning. Thank you so much for being here. My name is Libby Casey. I'm the politics and accountability anchor here at The Washington Post. And it is my pleasure to be joined here on stage today by Marla Beck, the founder and CEO of Bluemercury. Thank you so much for talking with all of us. It's great to have you here. </p><p>Beck: It's great to be here. </p><p>Casey: Thank you. Bluemercury, of course, is a luxury cosmetics retailer founded back in 1999, right here in our very own Georgetown. Marla and her partner and husband, Barry Beck, grew the business into a national beauty chain. In 2015, they sold the business to Macy's Inc. for $210 million. And we'll certainly talk about what that's meant for your job these days. </p><p> Before we begin though, I want to remind you that you can ask us questions, ask Marla questions. Use the hashtag on Twitter, #PostLive. And we can get those and share those with you. </p><p> So, just to start out, give us a sense of-because we all know the brand Bluemercury and where it's at now. Where did you start versus where you are now in terms of what you had, what you were creating, and where you're going?</p><p>Beck: Yeah. We started as a beauty e-commerce company in 1999-when I was in my 20s, so a long time ago-back during the first dot-com boom. And we quickly realized we were a little bit too early. And so moved straight from clicks to bricks, and started opening store locations. And we started with one store location in Georgetown, in Washington, D.C., and had that one location for a while till we figured it out. </p><p> And so, today, we're at 180 locations. But it has been a long journey. We've been through two recessions and certainly the dot-com bust in 2001 had a huge impact on us. But the original idea for e-commerce was really fun because, in graduate school, I had met this obscure entrepreneur, who came to talk to us about the internet. So this is 1999. I had just gotten my first email address and Google didn't even exist. And so, here this entrepreneur was talking to us about e-commerce and what it was all about. I was completely intrigued. </p><p> He explained how he was going to sell books on the internet. This happened to be Jeff Bezos. Nobody knew who Amazon was. Only 30 people showed up for the talk. But I was completely inspired. And so that's how we started as a beauty e-commerce company. I just wanted to bring beauty products to the internet. </p><p>Casey: A reminder for people who are under the age of, like, 30. Back in the '90s, this was the day of dial-up.</p><p>Beck: Yes. </p><p>Casey: You did not shop online yet. You guys were way ahead of your time. </p><p>Beck: Yeah. In fact, we were too early because we launched our internet site in 1999 and nobody was shopping on the internet. So we were all shopping-all the e-commerce founders were shopping from each other and that was about it. And so, we were almost bankrupt within the first six months because we were too early. </p><p>Casey: You had a million dollars in investment, in investors?</p><p>Beck: Yeah. So it was interesting time. It was an easy time to raise money. I'd say a little bit like today. We raised a million dollars in two weeks to start the company. And this was just a function of what the internet was like at that point in time. I sort of liken it to the CBD craze today, in terms of how people are raising money. It's crazy.</p><p> But we raised a million dollars in two weeks and we were off to the races. But it was a different time. It cost a million dollars to build a website back then. And all of a sudden, there were five other competitors that had raised 10 to $20 million. And so, we knew we were in trouble. We went out for follow-on funding and everyone said, \"No, no. There are too many competitors. We can't give you follow-on funding.\" </p><p> Now, what benefited us back then was you could only buy cosmetics at drug stores or department stores. So our beauty e-commerce idea, although we were too early, the idea of a store was actually revolutionary. Because 90% of luxury cosmetics were sold at the department stores. There were no free-standing beauty stores. And so, by opening a store in Georgetown, we were one of the first free-standing specialty beauty stores. And stores, actually, let you touch customers and, actually, were revenue-generating, unlike our e-commerce site, which didn't really generate much revenue back then.</p><p> So we really-I mean, they call it a \"pivot\" now. We had to pivot and change our strategy. But back then, it was called a \"failure\" and we were almost going out of business. So I love the business terms that sort of make it good for the failures. Pivot-we pivoted. </p><p>Casey: Did you have to convince investors that it was time to make that pivot? Did you have to trust your own instincts? Because you said that you were able to raise so much money because the internet was sort of hot and a brand-new thing. </p><p>Beck: Yeah. It was really difficult. So our first set of investors did not want us to open a store because they believed in pure internet e-commerce plays. That was the pitch. That's what we had pitched them on. They didn't want change course. And so, we raised money from a separate set of investors for the stores, and then combined the two business ultimately. </p><p> But you know, the internet businesses were getting multiples on eyeballs. And for stores, it's a very straightforward sort of metric, which is, you know, how much revenue, how much profit, and how much capital did you put in. And that was too common for the internet investors. And so we really did have to change how we were talking about the business and how we were pitching the business. </p><p> During the 2001 NASDAQ crash, there was no capital. So the angel capital and the venture capital closed up shop. So we ended up getting bank debt for a while on our inventory. But there was no way to raise additional capital for stores after our first two stores. So we really had to bootstrap and just figure it out on our own. </p><p> So it was a different time in terms of raising capital. We ultimately raised capital from an angel dinner club. These were common back then, where a bunch of people would get together and hear pitches and then throw in money. And we were really lucky because Ted Leonsis and Steve Case were actually part of the dinner club. And they had been entrepreneurs, so they saw and knew how hard it was. And so they threw in at the dinner club. </p><p> But now, there's a lot more angel investment and seed capital than there was back then. </p><p>Casey: Let me ask you about networking for a moment, just because you brought that up. Because I hear from a lot of women in my profession as well as in the entrepreneurial world, who sort of don't like the idea of networking. And sort of seeing it as transactional, right? </p><p>Beck: Right. </p><p>Casey: Like, it feels like something that's more corporate, less organic, less real. How do you talk to young entrepreneurs about seeing the benefits of networking and finding networking, like, right in your own backyard, realizing you may have far more of a strong network potential than you realize you have?</p><p>Beck: Well, I look at it a little bit differently. I look at the fact that you need mentors and you need champions. You find mentors that give you advise. And women come up to me, or entrepreneurs, at all sorts of events and say, \"Okay, I have this idea. What do you think?\" And so a mentor gives you advice and helps you sort of make your way and figure some things out.</p><p> A champion actually puts you into a new opportunity. And I have been fortunate to have champions throughout my life that really helped me with opportunities. And so I think, as a young entrepreneur, you're looking for both mentors and champions. So champions, a managing director who was at a private equity firm really helped me raise money. And they were the ones that introduced me to the angel dinner club. Leonard Lauder, from the Estee Lauder Corporation, I met him when Bluemercury was a year old. He walked into our first store and was curious about what we were up to. And so I pitched him so hard. I'm like, \"I need to carry your brands. We're going to change the world.\" And he looked at me and he said, \"Get a couple more stores first.\" </p><p> But I kept that relationship going. It wasn't much. I would just send him a note here and there, or ask him to grab coffee. And you'd be amazed, as an entrepreneur or even when you're a student, how many doors are open to you to ask. </p><p> And so I think, for me, networking sounds scary. I don't like networking, right? You have to be social. It sounds like you're meeting a lot of people you don't like or don't know. For me, it's that one-on-one relationship that you sort of start to develop with people, just through chance opportunities. And you have to judge whether-you know, they sort of can turn from being a mentor into a champion, but I look at that goal as the most important. And it's not just for entrepreneurs, it's for anyone in any career, or even in your personal life.</p><p>Casey: What do you see as your role as a leader in other business role models? What's your role in trying to cultivate new talent, encourage new talent, and make sure it's not only white men? In this case, of course, women are such a strong player in the beauty industry now. But how do you make sure that you are staying open or encouraging other people to stay open to people, new possibilities?</p><p>Beck: I mean, I think for us, we're a company that's 93% women and I'm very proud of that. So, for us, we really looked at it, especially from the store perspective. So we started with a pretty radical human resources strategy years ago. And for us, it was all about hiring full-time people into our stores. And I remember, people in the beauty industry would say, \"You're crazy. You have to have part time so you don't pay benefits.\" And I said, \"You're crazy. I want full-time people that are dedicated and committed to providing beauty advice.\"</p><p> And so what we did is we only hired full-timers into our stores. So what does that mean? People had a career with us and could develop and grow and lead. And now we have a ton of people who started as sales associates in our stores that are part of our corporate team. So I really believe in developing people from the ground up and giving them opportunities, no matter what their education is. I think you can teach leadership and I think you can teach management. And I think it's a really, really important piece of your job as a leader. And we are completely open, because of our model from the beginning. </p><p> As a leader, your job is really to set the mission. So our mission has always been really strong, which is to be the best at giving beauty advice. That helps people grab onto something that's not just corporate numbers. You know, some companies talk so much just about numbers, but this is about a dream, a vision, and you want people to be on your team for that. </p><p>Casey: Talk about the sale to Macy's. Was it a goal to go through that process? Like, if you could go back and talk to yourself 19 years ago, was that part of the dream, was getting big enough and successful enough that you would catch the attention of a major company? </p><p>Beck: I think when you're an entrepreneur-I mean, when I started, I had been inspired by other entrepreneurs. And I just wanted to change the world, right? And so, I don't think you stick with something for 19 years if you not really dedicated to it. And so, for me, I'm a builder. I wanted to build a great company. I think what happened in 2014 is we were getting calls from a lot of different companies and private equity firms that were interested in investing. </p><p> And I started listening because the competition started heating up in our industry. And I felt like we needed to scale more quickly. So after 14, 15 years in business, we had 60-something stores. You know, there were other competitors out there with 300, 500, a thousand. And so, I felt like it was time to scale-up.</p><p> We were building every department from scratch. So that's one thing, as a company, you know, you start entrepreneurially and you see with Mallory, who was on the panel before, she was talking about how she had one store and her staffing. Well, as you're scaling your company, you're building every department from scratch. So were building our technology department, our e-commerce department, our finance department, our HR department. And so, when you're building everything from scratch, it actually shows you down as you hit a certain amount of scale. So we wanted to take investment to accelerate our scale. </p><p> The other thing is, I felt like were going to fall behind in technology, the pace of technology of investment and the requirements for that were increasing. Macy's was the most attractive because they were the number seven e-commerce player in the country. They had the HR and finance infrastructure, and they had the supply chain. We had stores, we were trying to get product and goods to 60 stores, at that point. And if we wanted to grow, we had to accelerate that. And so, they had a set of resources that we really needed. It's been amazing.</p><p> What was important to me, also, was maintaining our DNA. You know, we're a family company. My husband and I started it. We still run it. And so, I wanted to keep that family-orientation. And so, the promise, which they've upheld, is that we would keep our headquarters separate, in D.C., and that we would run our own show. We've been able to use their resources and keep our DNA. And we've scaled from 60 to 180 locations and our internet business has scaled significantly. </p><p> But the technology requirements for any retailer continue to change and evolve. And so we're investing a lot there. </p><p>Casey: It is so fascinating that one of the ideas, initially at Bluemercury, was to break out of the mold of the department store, right? Touch the products, be able to choose from a variety of products, not just go to one counter, represented by one company, a different counter that might sell a different product. </p><p>Beck: Yes. </p><p>Casey: What is it like to see your products in a store like Macy's and explain how that retail relationship works out versus the stand-alone stores that you have. </p><p>Beck: So the different with Bluemercury is our staff are trained in all brands, as you mentioned. And so, a client walks in and you can help the client with any product. And traditionally, department stores have been counter by counter, brand by brand. So you come in, you shop with the Bobbi Brown brand or the Clinique brand. </p><p> And so what we've done is we've Bluemercury locations in Macy's sites. And so, that's interesting because the client can walk in, and rather than go to the counter for Macy's, they can actually experience what it's like to shop among brands. And what we've found is, they don't even notice that they've changed shopping environments right away. They just think it's part of Macy's, but a lot more brand selection. And so, it's been a great partnership. They're actually applying some of our human resource models to their form of cosmetics. And so, it's been a great partnership. They're learning from us and we're learning from them.</p><p>Casey: Was it hard to make that decision? Because this really was something that was such a family business, as you talked about. You and your family are so invested in it, not just in terms of the finances, but just the creative control, the vision for it. </p><p>Beck: It was really hard. I mean, Bluemercury was our first baby. We had Bluemercury before we had our three kids. And so, that was a very, very difficult decision. I was worried I was going to lose control. And as an entrepreneur, you know, sometimes people become entrepreneurs-and especially me-is because you want to control everything you do. I'm a little bit of a control freak, so, yes.</p><p> But we've been able to maintain that. And so, I feel like it was a good decision. I think the competitive pace of business sometimes is that you have to hit scale more quickly today than maybe you did in the past, for some businesses. Especially for large retail chains that are competitive. </p><p> It was the right decision. Our staff's happy. Their benefits are much stronger than ours. I think it's given them more of a career path, too, to go from 60 to 180 locations, provides our team with a lot of opportunities to grow. </p><p>Casey: A reminder, you can throw your questions into this discussion if you're in the room or if you're watching online. Just use that hashtag #PostLive on Twitter. </p><p> You were a disrupter when you started this company. And now there is so much disruption in the industry. </p><p>Beck: Yeah. </p><p>Casey: How is Instagram affecting the beauty business and how are you learning from people even like your kids, as they are so oriented-and I'm not talking about your children, but teenagers, generally, the pre-teens-are so oriented to what they're seeing online, how they're learning from their peers, how they're learning from these role models they find on social media?</p><p>Beck: I think, for beauty, Instagram provides a marketing and opportunity that did not exist before, where it's very democratic and you have a lot more diversity in terms of what's available on Instagram. It's fundamentally affecting categories of the business. </p><p> So what's interesting is the mask category, facial masks was so teeny in the business. </p><p>Casey: Okay, so facial masks, like the mask you put on to-</p><p>Beck: Yeah, like Brady Bunch masks.</p><p>Casey: -cleanse your skin-[OVERLAPPING]</p><p>Beck: Yeah. You leave it on. They look black. You know, you peel it off after 10 minutes. </p><p>Casey: A great idea from someone my age, but it was shocking to me learn that, like, 13-year-olds are also doing it. </p><p>Beck: You know what? It's a statement. So if I wear a mask and I take a picture, it means I'm taking care of myself. It doesn't mean, necessarily, that I've found the best mask ever. So it's a statement teenagers are making to each other, but it's exploded the mask business. And the lipstick business has exploded because if I change my lip color, I'm actually changing my Instagram picture. So it's fundamentally affecting pieces of the business. </p><p> The other thing we have is Instagram-first beauty company. So it's also creating new business models. So Kylie Cosmetics built a $500 million business just through Instagram and her digital site. That would have been unheard of years ago. There's another brand called \"Winky Lux\" that built their whole business via Instagram. And now they're turning the retail model on its head, where they have a store in New York City, they charge you to go into the store, $10, but every room is Instagram-able. And the sell a little bit of product, but it's all about Instagram. But it's a new retail model.</p><p> And so, Instagram has fundamentally changed the business models and how people purchase cosmetics. </p><p>Casey: How does it affect your business? Like, how does it affect everything from how you learn about products and what's trending and what might be something that's going to be popular for a couple of months, so you might want to carry it for a little while or learn more about it, versus something that's going to be a tried and true long-term seller?</p><p>Beck: Well, I mean, it gives you such access to customer feedback right away. And so, it's increased the pace at which we change our merchandising, which I think is really fun. It used to be, you know, we went into the stores and talked to customers, we interviewed them, we emailed them. Now, you get instant feedback. Every day you can look to see what's trending. </p><p> And so, you have to be a merchant and decide what's important, but you also get great feedback right away about what's important in the business. But by knowing your customer and staying true to your customer, you know how to react to it. </p><p>Casey: You've created your own beauty product lines. How much of you goes into that? How much are you testing out products? Talk about why you decided to go into the creation business and not just the retail side of things. </p><p>Beck: I like to solve problems. And so, back when we started our first brand, M-61 Skincare, we had a lot of clients coming into our stores. And I'm in the stores all the time because I'm fascinated by talking to people.</p><p>Casey: Do people know it's you? Do they recognize you?</p><p>Beck: Some do and some don't. It depends. We have clients coming in and saying, \"I love natural products but they don't do anything to my skin.\" And we had other clients coming in saying, \"I love the dermatologist doctor's brands, but they're full of chemicals.\" And so, we saw a need that wasn't being met. We created M-61 as the most natural cosmeceutical line on the market with vegan skincare in 2012. Then we just created Lune+Aster, a vegan cosmetics line, also because we saw clients wanted vegan, low chemical cosmetics. </p><p> And so, by talking to customers and seeing the gaps in the market, you actually can bring product to market more quickly. And, yes, I am active in every little bit. I'm obsessed about cosmetics, always have been. And so I do all the product development with our team. So, something really important to me. </p><p> Beauty has always been a great place for entrepreneurs. Female entrepreneurs, like Estee Lauder, Elizabeth Arden, started there. And so, for me, it's so intriguing to see how many new beauty entrepreneurs there are every day. That's my favorite thing about the industry. </p><p>Casey: When you meet new entrepreneurs, young, but let's leave room for other entrepreneurs. You don't have to start when you're 20, right? </p><p>Beck: No. </p><p>Casey: You can start a little later, too-</p><p>Beck: Yeah. </p><p>Casey: -with a career change or a new idea. How do you know-how can you tell, as someone who's been through this, that they're ready, that they know the market, they know their product, they know the risks that they're taking. What are some signals to you that someone is prepared for what they're diving into? </p><p>Beck: It's when they have this burning desire to solve a problem and nothing is going to stop them. I don't think you have to know everything. I mean, I go back to how na\u00efve I was when I was in my 20s, starting a business. I just had an idea. My idea was a total failure within six months, but I got in the game, and I was close enough to the industry and what was interesting to me that I figured it out. </p><p> I think most entrepreneurs, their first idea is probably completely wrong. But if you have the passion, you stick to it, and you figure it out. And so, I think it's all about being ready to just drive. Entrepreneurship is tough. I mean, Elon Musk said it's like eating glass. Some days, it is really tough. Everything can go wrong for you. So you have to have that passion and drive to get through it. Like I said, the idea itself doesn't matter upfront. </p><p>Casey: Do you have to have a passion and drive for the product or the idea that you have? Do you have to have a passion and drive for the customers? I mean, you can see sort of both sides. Someone who, for example, loves jewelry design, loves jewelry-making, but has to learn a lot about the market and learn about commerce. Versus the other model of someone who might be really steeped in business school and known a lot about marketing, and know a lot about how to raise capital, but do they also need that passion to create something?</p><p>Beck: I think it's hard to start and stick with it if you don't have that passion. I mean, before I started Bluemercury, I had been in private equity and I was buying janitorial maintenance companies. And so, yeah, I had a business degree, I knew a ton about that sector, but I never would have started something in that business. I wasn't passionate about it. </p><p> And so you have to start something that you have a passion for. It makes it easier. And so, it's marrying that business expertise with that passion. </p><p>Casey: Any final thoughts you'd like to leave us with?</p><p>Beck: You know, I think we're all entrepreneurs every day in our lives. I think exercising that creative mindset is really important for everyone to do. </p><p>Casey: So this is a creative job for you?</p><p>Beck: It's a creative job. Yeah. That's where I get excited, new ideas, talking to new entrepreneurs. We get to carry their products, so I talk to new entrepreneurs every day. Being creative is an important aspect, I think, of self-actualization. I encourage everybody to find a way to be creative.</p><p>Casey: All right. Thank you so much, Marla Beck. That's all the time we have this morning. You can, of course, watch this later on if you'd like. If you'd like to share parts of the conversation, go to WashingtonPostLive.com.

Good morning everyone.\u00a0 My name is Kris Coratti.\u00a0 I'm vice president of communications and events at The Washington Post.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us on this very rainy morning.\u00a0 I'm glad you all made it out.\u00a0 We are going to have a fascinating series of discussion this morning on artificial intelligence.\u00a0 This is the latest in our ongoing event series that we call \"Transformers.\"\u00a0 And our speakers this morning are going to explore the regulatory questions around this technology.\u00a0 They going to look at how AI is reshaping the way we live and work.\u00a0 And they're going to discuss how to make sure this technology is used responsibly in the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before we begin, I just want to quickly thank our presenting sponsor for this even, Software.org, the BSA Foundation, and our supporting sponsor, the University of Virginia.\u00a0 And so now I'd like to go ahead and welcome to the stage The Washington Post's

Thanks so much for being here on a rainy, rainy morning here.\u00a0 And for those who don't know, <person><nameText>Senator Cantwell </nameText></person>is a Democrat from Washington State.\u00a0 Senator Young, a Republican from Indiana.\u00a0 Both are members of a Senate commerce committee which touches on artificial intelligence and many tech issues that we'll talk about today.</p><p>Before we get going, just a reminder that we will be taking questions from both the audience and on social media.\u00a0 Just tweet us with the hashtag #Transformers.\u00a0 I'll see it on my nifty little

you.</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have a lot to talk about in artificial intelligence.\u00a0 It is a very large field, but I would be remiss if I didn't start by asking you about the big news of the week, and that's Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\u00a0 For those who missed the story, Facebook is in a bit of hot water right now because Cambridge Analytica, which is a data analytics firm tied to <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>was able to abscond with information from about 50 million Facebook users, and perhaps without their permission or without their knowledge.\u00a0 We're now hearing calls for investigations and so forth.</p><p>So given the fact we're having this conversation about the power of algorithms, and machine learning, and deep learning, and so forth, I'd love to get your take on the news and what you think government should do from here.\u00a0 <person><nameText>Senator Cantwell?</nameText></person></p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I definitely think we need transparency.\u00a0 My colleagues have certainly-Senator Klobuchar and others proposed legislation to make sure that we have fair and honest elections online.\u00a0 That is that people comply to the same kind of laws that you have to comply to for advertising and information that we do in the broadcast world.\u00a0 So that's one aspect of this.</p><p>And then the other aspect is just transparency.\u00a0 We need to know and understand how information is being used, and who is behind that information.\u00a0 Obviously, concerns about falsifying information in the bot realm of anything from political use to information like on net neutrality at the FCC, those are things where transparency-how information's being created.\u00a0 Transparency is very, very important.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator Young?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I agree with everything Maria said.\u00a0 We need transparency with respect to what data is being collected.\u00a0 That's not always clear to users.\u00a0 And how that data is being used.\u00a0 But I would also add we need to ensure there's accountability from all parties involved in these different decisions.\u00a0 And so Congress has an important role to play in ensuring if we don't have clear rules with respect to accountability-who should be responsible for what, what transparency should look like-then we need to optimize our existing systems.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So on the note of accountability, should Mark Zuckerberg come testify on Capitol Hill?\u00a0 You both sit on the commerce committee.\u00a0 Should he come?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, John Thune, who is indeed the chairman of the commerce committee, I believe has invited him recently to come appear.\u00a0 It would be my hope that we hear from top leadership.\u00a0 If Mr. Zuckerberg wants to appear, I'd certainly welcome his appearance.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <person><nameText>Senator Cantwell?</nameText></person></p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, there's a lot of people I'd like to hear from on this thing at large.\u00a0 So I think that Mr. Zuckerberg should make himself available to discuss where technology is going in the future, and discuss the challenges that we face in this realm, and add to the debate, not be silent on it.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So to zoom out a bit, do you find that some of these companies, the leading, cutting-edge companies when it comes to artificial intelligence are black boxes; that you don't really know how the algorithms work; you don't know what the inputs are?\u00a0 And does that make it hard to do oversight from your perspective?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think we're entering an age where artificial intelligence is going to provide great benefits.\u00a0 If you look back to the early days of the internet, there was lots of anxiety about what the applications would be, and yet here we are, years later, and we see the full power of it, and how unbelievable it is.\u00a0 You know, we probably, a few years ago, had the same discussion about drones and whether drone technology should be allowed.\u00a0 And yet, we're coming to the precipices now where we see the advantage; whether it's fighting forest fires and having accurate information, or a lot of different areas; that it isn't about the technology itself.\u00a0 It is about the application.</p><p>So I would hope that we would have the same approach to AI; that it is going to empower us.\u00a0 I think particularly in the area of cybersecurity, for a lot of great solutions.\u00a0 Do we have to have some discussions about how it plays out?\u00a0 Yes, and that is why Senator Young and I introduced our legislation because we want government to be part of that discussion, and to make sure that we are not only taking advantage of the opportunities, but also looking at those questions of bias, which we know will be there and on the table for discussion.</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So your question, it sort of cuts to the heart of a very important policy issue, which is, under what circumstances should we have full transparency?\u00a0 That is, an algorithm made public versus just accountability.\u00a0 That is, accountability for whoever happens to have that algorithm available to users.\u00a0 This is one frankly that I'm not equipped to be able to offer my perspective on yet, which is exactly why Maria and I have put together the Future of AI Act.</p><p>We see incredible potential in this technology.\u00a0 It's already moving forward at a rapid pace in the private sector.\u00a0 Government is a bit behind here.\u00a0 And before we over-regulate it, we want to make sure that we get a better understanding of what sort of policy structures need to be in place so that people can meaningfully participate in an economy driven, in large measure, by AI, so that it's not biased, as Maria mentioned.\u00a0 And so that hopefully America can lead with respect to this technology, which has the potential to increase our rate of economic growth.</p><p>I've been briefed by up to doubling it within just over 15 years.\u00a0 So your policy question, a good one.\u00a0 I don't think we have a clear answer on it yet.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 On the Future of AI Act, which had just mentioned, talk a little bit about the legislation.\u00a0 It's essentially a taskforce.\u00a0 Is that right?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's right.\u00a0 We house the taskforce at the Department of Commerce.\u00a0 We will convene data scientists, members of the manufacturing industry, technologist, and various other stakeholders to advise members of Congress and our federal government about what the future of AI legislative and regulatory policy should look like.\u00a0 So that, again, everyone can meaningfully participate; be skilled up so that they can fit right into an economy-driven by AI.\u00a0 And also, we want to make sure that people's privacy is protected and that these algorithms are unbiased.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Go ahead, Senator.</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, just adding on that, we wanted to look at four areas that we thought were important.\u00a0 One, what are the areas of competition that the U.S. should be mindful of given other people's investment in AI, whether that's in China or other countries, and where do we fall into keeping our R&amp;D prowess here.\u00a0 And what do we need to do to keep that going?</p><p>We're going from here to an energy hearing where I'm going to be very concerned about the level of cuts in the R&amp;D budget for energy.\u00a0 The fact that people want to zero out ARPA-E in this administration is just like crazy.\u00a0 So what do we need to do to keep the level of competitiveness.\u00a0 And then as Senator Young mentioned, both privacy and bias will also be part of the discussion.\u00a0 And then lastly, workforce.\u00a0 What are the workforce implications and what do we need to about that?\u00a0 Both in capturing-I can tell you right now, if you have any kind of AI education, please head to Seattle, Washington.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] We need you.</p><p>The employers there are telling me, you know, it's a very, very, very competitive field right now for anybody who has any expertise here.\u00a0 And it's just going to grow.\u00a0 So what do we need to do to both grow the workforce in this area, and what do we need to do to prepare and diversify our workforce too?\u00a0 So those are the four pillars of the legislation.\u00a0 And I think that we are not saying that's the only thing to be discussed, but at least it gives us a framework for the important policies that are out there today.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 And if I'm reading between the lines correctly, and correct me if I'm wrong, what I gather from that is that you think that some of your peers, perhaps, in Congress and throughout Washington maybe aren't equipped to understand the issues.\u00a0 They're not familiar with them.\u00a0 They're not talking to some of the companies in the way that you guys are.\u00a0 Is Congress equipped to tackle AI right now?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I don't think we are.\u00a0 That's why we've created this panel.\u00a0 I like a measure of humility from my legislators, and this is certainly an emerging field.\u00a0 What we need to do before we prescriptively regulate or legislate in this area is understand what sort of challenges and opportunities are created by this technology; recognizing it's inevitable that we will continue to have advancements in machine learning, and data science, and all the other sort of subsets of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What would you like to see from the Trump administration right now?\u00a0 I know there was that whole controversy about a year about with Steve Mnuchin, saying that it's going to be a long time before AI starts to have an impact on the economy.\u00a0 What would you like to see from the Trump administration on AI?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, the last administration, the Obama administration, did a report and came out with some basic findings.\u00a0 One of them was the huge economic potential in AI for us as a nation.\u00a0 So I think that those ramifications need to be followed up on.\u00a0 That report, I think, outlined some areas in which we could all agree that we need further investment.</p><p>To me, I think maybe we're even talking about an AI engineering institute, similar to what exists now at Carnegie Mellon for software.\u00a0 Something that where we're going to talk about standards; we're going to talk about certification processes; we're going to talk about a lot of the issues we just discussed.\u00a0 So what is that next phase of development, and then what are following up on, what are some of those applications that best are suited to us at the federal level; those applications that are going to help us, whether it is cybersecurity or disaster relief issues.\u00a0 You know, big data information.</p><p>It kind of bugs me that the Europeans on the weather forecasting, just because they use supercomputing for their algorithms, they're constantly producing better data on storm and storm impact than we are.\u00a0 So what are we going to do to stay competitive on some of these important issues.\u00a0 So I think the Trump administration should take the Obama administration recommendations here and go further on that investment.</p><p>Now, I don't know where the president is on science.\u00a0 If I could, you know, do anything, I would give him a little tattoo right there, science, because [LAUGHTER] I think he needs to put a more down payment on these areas.\u00a0 But that's, again, a very Northwest perspective, kind of view of the world.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I would start with the recognition that contrary to conventional economic belief, countries do compete, not just firms.\u00a0 And there's a competition in the realm of AI right now.\u00a0 And so we need to make some strategic investments as a country in particular technologies.\u00a0 And AI strikes me as a natural one based on our existing expertise in both data science and supercomputing.\u00a0 You mesh the two and you get artificial intelligence capabilities.</p><p>So we need to make some strategic bets.\u00a0 Once we decide what those bets should be, we invest in those particular areas.\u00a0 I don't think it's a real obstacle that the Trump administration hasn't been prescriptive in this area.\u00a0 I actually welcome it.\u00a0 As a member of Congress, I think it's great that we have an opportunity to legislate in this space as opposed to having very little interaction with the executive branch, which is what I experienced during my six years in the House of Representatives.</p><p>I see this as an opportunity.\u00a0 And I think it's a good opportunity for bipartisan work.\u00a0 And that's what Maria and I are doing with this AI legislation.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 Let's talk about the industry and some of its policy challenges.\u00a0 I'm struck every time Elon Musk gets on stage and talks about how AI is akin to nuclear weapons.\u00a0 I think he said it could cause more damage than a nuclear bomb.\u00a0 Previously he's talked about going to Mars to avoid whatever catastrophe AI may cause here on the planet Earth.\u00a0 When you hear statements like that from somebody who works in this field, in this industry, what does it mean for you from a policy and political perspective?\u00a0 Whichever one of you wants to take the question.</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I think that we can all go a long way and have in lots of-there's probably been many a movie about this already, right?\u00a0 So just as I said earlier about other technology applications, the issue isn't, are you going to move forward on technology.\u00a0 The issue is what do you want to do about those applications.\u00a0 I'm kind of struck by the same discussion we had over the last, I would say, 15, 20 years, about stem cell research.\u00a0 And yet, right now at the University of Washington, we're making regenerative heart tissue.\u00a0 So I'm pretty sure I'm glad that we had the conversation.\u00a0 And I'm pretty sure I'm glad that we moved forward.</p><p>Now, was there a lot of question about what stem cells were going to be used for, and trying to have a broader debate, yes.\u00a0 But I think this is the issue with AI, is that while Elon can bring up some very important issues, that's why we want this legislation to have that discussion, and to have that consideration.\u00a0 So I think that we have plenty of time for that.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator, do you agree?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I think that was a good example.\u00a0 I think those previous conversations about other difficult issues allowed us to achieve at a least a measure of consensus on what was, in the beginning, an incredibly difficult issue, and now we're starting to identify a lot of consensus in that area, and therefore medical breakthroughs.\u00a0 In the area of artificial intelligence, which I think, frankly, it's an anthropomorphic term.\u00a0 Maybe we should just call it sort of gap filling; gap filling our existing capabilities.\u00a0 It is another tool.\u00a0 It's a tool that sometimes makes people uncomfortable because the notion of extending one's intelligence and augmenting it, for whatever reason, makes us less comfortable than extending our physical capabilities, like one would with a hammer or something else in the physical space.</p><p>So we need to normalize that idea and also recognize that as with any tool, it can be used for good or for ill.\u00a0 And I would hope that this panel that we've convened through the Future of AI Act would consider some of these contingencies as well, to put the public at ease, and also to prepare for the potential of using AI, not just for those wonderful things we've talked about: doubling the rate of economic growth, increasing the productivity of a worker by up to 40% in just over 15 years.\u00a0 But also, addressing concerns people have.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 We say some of the potential perils on the automation side of all of this just yesterday with reports that a self-driving car operated by Uber had killed a woman in Arizona.\u00a0 This is coming a time when Congress is considering legislation that would put more self-driving cars on U.S. roads.\u00a0 Is this an example of people reacting too strongly to something that happened, or is this case in point, maybe Congress needs to slow down and think a little bit more before it does something like put more self-driving cars on U.S. roads?\u00a0 <person><nameText>Senator Cantwell?</nameText></person></p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, we're definitely going to get-first of all, I'm so sorry for the loss of a life in Arizona, and to that woman's family.\u00a0 So our sympathies go to them.\u00a0 We'll hear from the NTSB about what that accident was about, and the details.\u00a0 And I've read some reports from the Arizona newspapers about what they think has been the experience with these cars; that people feel like in some of these areas they actually have worked successfully to stop accidents from happening.\u00a0 So we need to look at all the data and information.\u00a0 That's why we have this oversight.</p><p>I can tell you from the aerospace industry that the technology-driven cockpit has provided us more safety and security.\u00a0 It has improved the ability and performance of our airline industry.\u00a0 So, again, we want to move ahead with things that are going to help us provide more safety and security.\u00a0 But, yes, we have to get to the bottom of what was the detail in this individual instance and area, and what do we need to do to resolve any of these issues.</p><p>It's not as if we're not going to have problems.\u00a0 There are things that are called \"software glitches,\" and they can have serious consequences.\u00a0 But again, it's the question of how do we move ahead. \u00a0And our job in oversight, and particularly whether it's NIST or the Department of Transportation is to make sure that we are not putting people in undue risk by not having that oversight and structure when it comes to the implementation of new technology.\u00a0 And that's the job we do in talking to those agencies about that oversight responsibility.</p><p>So, as you can imagine, we had a lot of discussion with Toyota about their cars, and what was a software glitch.\u00a0 And yes, it was complex, very complex, to the point we have to get-I think you're hearing from NASA later today-but I think we actually had to get NASA to tell us what exactly happened in that instance.\u00a0 So the complexity of this, because it's going to be related to software and software algorithms, is going to be harder.\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 Well, then let's set up an agency and the proper people here to understand it.\u00a0 We don't want to be laggards on AI at a government level, where an industry is moving forward, and we have no real ability to do our oversight responsibilities.</p><p>That's why I think something like an AI institute, engineering institute, to help the government, just as we do right now on FAA issues, is probably a proper role and responsibility.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But culturally speaking, are Americans ready for software glitches where the consequences or the repercussions might be the loss of human life?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course not.\u00a0 And so, of course not.\u00a0 But at the same time, if that technology drove into the cockpit of an airplane better safety standards and better measures, which is, I think, what people would tell you today has happened, then, yes, we want to keep improving for safety standards.\u00a0 We want that help and information.</p><p>And so it's not an either/or situation.\u00a0 It is what is the responsible oversight role for us to play, and making sure we have people at the federal level who have the ability, with a basic understanding of the technology, to actually oversee it.\u00a0 And I think that is probably right now where we're missing a little bit of, if you will, technology oomph here to make sure that we are building that, because it's such a new area.\u00a0 Such a new area.</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So as we adopt new technologies, there is unquestionably a higher standard for those technologies than the existing technology.\u00a0 I just think we have to recognize that.\u00a0 In this particular instance, this tragic incident-of course, we feel for the family, our prayers are with the young lady's family-but we also, as policy makers, I think, need to provide some context when we talk about these things.</p><p>In 2015, 9 out of every 10 auto fatalities in this country happened on account of user error.\u00a0 We can improve on that.\u00a0 And that's what autonomous vehicle technology aims to do.\u00a0 This is safety technology.\u00a0 And as it's developed, there will likely be some unfortunate mishaps along the way, and we need to do everything we can to put in place a regulatory structure, a legal structure, to make sure that's not the case.\u00a0 That's why the AV START Act, which we've passed out, the commerce committee, I hope is soon put on the president's desk and signed into law so that we can create a proper regulatory structure for development of these technologies.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 One of the other consequences, when we're talking about AI, it always comes back to job loss, the potential for job loss.\u00a0 And I was struck as I was doing research for this, I stumbled upon a Gartner Report that said by 2020, AI could wipe out 1.8 million jobs, but then generate 2.3 million jobs.\u00a0 What role does Congress have in retraining Americans that they're able to pursue those 2.3 million jobs that AI helps create?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Education, education, education.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is Congress going to pay for it?\u00a0 Are they going to put the money out?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, first of all, we need to do all we can to drive down the cost of education.\u00a0 Senator Collins and I have a bill, a first-ever federal incentive for apprentice because we think we need to skill and train so many Americans.\u00a0 As I talked about, cybersecurity, it's already clear.\u00a0 We need 1.5 million new energy workers.\u00a0 A big chunk of them in cybersecurity.\u00a0 So we already have this problem today.\u00a0 In fact, I personally believe that the challenge of our era is the transitioning nature of our economy that is going to continue to change.</p><p>I always say to people in my office, there's a reason Ma Bell doesn't exist anymore.\u00a0 But then the young people are like, \"Who's Ma Bell?\"\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] They don't even know.\u00a0 And so the fact that we've gone from a behemoth in telecom to now this handheld device is a major transition.\u00a0 But that is going to happen in every sector.\u00a0 The newspaper industry.\u00a0 What have you been through?\u00a0 Okay, so it's going to happen.\u00a0 I believe you prepare for that.</p><p>And one of the ways you prepare for that is to upgrade our education investment.\u00a0 Sure, you can make it more efficient.\u00a0 You can help drive down the cost.\u00a0 But we have to prepare a system that is going to allow us to skill and train people for those new jobs, and to be able to help us capture the economic opportunity that's there.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We also need to change how we train for careers and for jobs.\u00a0 McKinsey Global has done some interesting work in this area.\u00a0 They looked at 800 different job categories.\u00a0 They found that-their estimate is that 1 out of 20 jobs will go away entirely as AI technology develops, but 60% of those 800 job categories will see a portion of their job be automated through AI technology.\u00a0 So that suggests, yes, some workers will have to be entirely retrained, and we need support systems, and public investment to ensure those support systems are there for retraining in the new job categories.</p><p>But we also need, what I would imagine would be, more compressed training regimens for those workers, who the nature of their existing job will change.\u00a0 So we're already seeing colleges and universities, many private programs, offering six-week programs, 10-week programs, as technology continues to evolve, to prepare people to be on the cutting edge of their given profession.\u00a0 There's some creative things we need to do as well, because the cost of education has gone up, we all know, over years, and college debt, and so forth.</p><p>For example, I offered legislation that would allow private investors to invest in students.\u00a0 Whether someone wants to major in electrical engineering or data science through a standard four-year curriculum, or a 12-week coding program, private investors could pay for that student.\u00a0 The student would then pay back the private investor after completing the program of study, thus shifting all the risk of noncompletion onto the private investors.\u00a0 And only putting a debt burden on that student should they land a job on the back end.</p><p>So these are the sorts of creative things that I think you'll see emerging increasingly as we adapt to this new normal of education and training.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the ideas that's been proposed is this idea of a robot tax, right?\u00a0 Whether it's Bill Gates or folks in California.\u00a0 There's been conversation about whether you tax robots or other forms of technology that take the place of a job currently held by a human.\u00a0 Is that one of the ways that the federal government can help pay for retraining?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, this is probably an area we might disagree, but I am so grateful to have my colleague here, and to work on this together.\u00a0 But, yeah.\u00a0 I would have taken the tax bill and put a big down payment on retraining.\u00a0 I would have.\u00a0 You know, even on the repatriation discussion, in the past we had talked about saying that some of that should have gone for retraining.\u00a0 Now, do I think the public and the private sector are in this together, and that companies are pretty motivated here too?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 But I do think that this, as I said, is one of our biggest challenges is how to accelerate this right now.</p><p>So, to me, I would use whatever incentives we could because it is what is going to help us with the productivity wage growth.\u00a0 I think Seattle has had something like 2.3.\u00a0 So we're one of the cities in America that has actually seen that wage growth, but you're going to have to make this investment.\u00a0 So let's figure out the most cost-effective ways for the public and private sector to partner together, to drive that down.\u00a0 But would I put that on the table instead of some of the other elements of the tax bill?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 That's what I would have done.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Senator, robot tax?</p><p>Young:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would not start by taxing capital investments, which is what this is, a new form of capital investment.\u00a0 We could have also taken-and Maria and I might disagree on this-the stimulus package, and invested heavily in worker training.\u00a0 So I think we both agree, in a bipartisan way, the worker training is essential in this new hyperdynamic economy we're in.\u00a0 We're going to find ways to adapt to the new sort of training that's required.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 We have just about a minute or so left, so I don't want to leave before we touch on one last issue which is bias when it comes to artificial intelligence.\u00a0 It's one of the things that the Obama administration had warned in its final report about artificial intelligence; this potential for prejudice to be embedded in the code itself.\u00a0 What role does Washington play in this space?\u00a0 Does it force companies to change their hiring practice?\u00a0 What can Congress do here?</p><p>Cantwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, we need a robust discussion.\u00a0 We need a robust discussion just as we had one, as I said, about stem cell research.\u00a0 One of my biggest complaints right now is on capital formation for the SBA and the amount of capital that-or so little of it that goes to women and minorities.\u00a0 And why is that?\u00a0 I mean, they had like 4% of SBA capital, some ridiculous number.\u00a0 And you're thinking, \"Why is that?\u00a0 So what's the bias there?\"</p><p>Well, when you peel it back, you find lots of different things.\u00a0 Women like smaller loan amounts, and the programs aren't geared towards them, or the counseling that exists are geared towards not the same applications as women startups.\u00a0 So there's a whole bunch of issues there, but is that a bias?\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 It's a bias.\u00a0 It's a problem.\u00a0 And do we want somebody to bake a bias into an algorithm?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 And we are going to do our best to try to figure out what is the proper role to make sure that doesn't happen.</p><p>But I guarantee you, there are so many biases that exist today in other policy, and we have to keep in mind that the broadest-that's, again, why I think an institute-these international stand-like IEEE, or other organizations that help us discuss standards for, you know, electronics and other areas, are important tools for a broader discussion.\u00a0 And we should empower somebody, like with our taskforce, to have that discussion, so that we can come up with some ideas and parameters about this.</p><p>Romm:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 And that, unfortunately, is going to have to be our last word on this because <person><nameText>Senator Cantwell's </nameText></person>got to run, and I'm going to get the hook.\u00a0 But thank you both

colleague.</p><p>[APPLAUSE]</p><p>          Humans and Machines: One-on-one with Microsoft's Peggy Johnson       </p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning, everyone.\u00a0 Thank you for joining us.\u00a0 I'm Drew Harwell.\u00a0 I'm a national tech reporter for The Washington Post covering AI and big data.\u00a0 And I am very honored to welcome Peggy Johnson.\u00a0 She is an executive vice president for business development at Microsoft, which is a company that's been thinking about this for a long time.\u00a0 Bill Gates has been talking about AI research for probably 25 years now.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Twenty-five years.\u00a0 Yeah.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So we just want to talk a little bit with Peggy.\u00a0 She oversees the investments through Microsoft's venture capital arm, which has invested millions in AI and other startups.\u00a0 She is also an engineer, and before this she spent 24 years at Qualcomm, which has also been in the news for different reasons.\u00a0 There's also a book out in the lobby that Microsoft did called The Future Computed: Artificial Intelligence and Its Role in Society.\u00a0 It's very good and very smart.\u00a0 And I've also been told that before we get started I'd like to remind our audience that you can tweet your questions using the #Transformers.\u00a0 So, make them good.</p><p>So, let's begin.\u00a0 Microsoft has been thinking about this for a long time.\u00a0 Where are we at now in AI?\u00a0 Where is the research?\u00a0 Where is the development?\u00a0 And how is it sort of affecting people's lives?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So I think a lot of people think AI is a new trend.\u00a0 It's actually been around for quite some time.\u00a0 Bill Gates, about 25 years ago, when he was starting Microsoft Research, sort of had this prediction back then.\u00a0 He said, \"Someday computers are going to be able to see us, hear us, talk to us, understand us.\"\u00a0 And it was quite prescient, because now we're coming to that point where they are.\u00a0 And I think the reason it's now top of mind is a lot of trends have all converged.\u00a0 So the idea of cloud computing, big data, AI algorithms, you mix all those together and now we have some momentum behind it.\u00a0 And we're starting to see real impact.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are they really understanding us, though?\u00a0 Help us understand-they're hearing us, there's voice recognition.\u00a0 There's facial recognition.\u00a0 But what are the limits now?\u00a0 I mean, are they really sort of comprehending like a human one?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, it's interesting.\u00a0 For a long time, it seemed that was a very hard problem to solve-voice recognition, image recognition.\u00a0 But over the last few years that's really accelerated.\u00a0 And now, both of those actually are cognitive services that we have that have both voice and image recognition, are testing out better than human voice recognition and human image recognition.\u00a0 Slightly better.\u00a0 So we're now at the point where this is a tool now that we can put into place for a number of good uses.\u00a0 So it is real, and it is starting to have some early impact in this space.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 I want to riff off a little bit of what Tony was talking about.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This issue of bias and this issue of things getting baked into the system.\u00a0 We know that AI depends on data and compute power.\u00a0 And if the data is biased, there's going to be issues in the compute and in the product.\u00a0 So from the company side and from the research side, how do you all think about paving over those issues, trying to make as fair and equitable of an AI product as possible?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So it's important to think about it.\u00a0 And we do.\u00a0 We take it very, very seriously.\u00a0 But if you just imagine a pool of data and that data is now going to be used to train an AI algorithm, there's no pool of data that's perfect, right?\u00a0 And particularly when you start to talk about social impact and social uses of it, you want to make sure that that data is the best data possible.\u00a0 And you want to make sure that you go into it knowing there's going to be some bias in the data, which is why you still want to have humans involved in the equation.</p><p>So, for instance, you mentioned I'm an engineer.\u00a0 So let's say we had an AI algorithm that we wanted to train to find us the most successful engineering candidates.\u00a0 I'm getting ready to start a company, I need the best engineers.\u00a0 I might say, \"Let me search back in the pool of data that I have on engineers, and let me try and find what will be the attributes that would make the most successful engineers.\"\u00a0 So I might look at skills at training, those sorts of things.</p><p>But one thing that that data would show is it's mostly men.\u00a0 I know because I grew up in that industry.\u00a0 My university, most of the time I was the only woman in the room, when I was practicing engineering.\u00a0 So if we just relied on the data, we would input that data into the algorithm.\u00a0 The algorithm would say, \"Successful engineers are men.\"\u00a0 And we know that's not the case, for a whole number of reasons.\u00a0 We know-we're starting to understand more why there is this gender gap in engineering.\u00a0 But if you solely relied on the data, you would introduce a bias and then you would amplify the bias.\u00a0 Because on the other end you say, \"Well, this is what the computer says.\u00a0 The computer says successful engineers are men.\"\u00a0 Those are the sorts of things we have to take the utmost care and ensure that we have a human involved in that equation who understands, \"Well, this data might be slightly tainted.\"</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I find that part of it really fascinating, the idea that you could solve these problems of sort of recruitment bias and that sort of thing, with a computer.\u00a0 But having the human oversight there, what does that provide us and how can we keep that part of it in check?\u00a0 What sort of guidelines would you put an oversight of the kind of human moderator in the process?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So we definitely need to deploy this technology responsibly.\u00a0 And a couple years ago, about mid-2016, our CEO, Satya Nadella, who had been thinking about this, introduced a set of principles, and he said, \"As we develop this technology, we need to ensure that we have protections in place for things like fairness, safety, security, transparency, accountability\"-you heard the senators bring up accountability.\u00a0 Privacy, inclusiveness.\u00a0 All of these things have to be things you think about as you're training these algorithms.\u00a0 And you have to do so with a core of empathy.\u00a0 And you have to ensure that as you're training the algorithms you're doing so with dignity.\u00a0 Because again, as you said, you know, we could be using these algorithms to help us find the best candidates for jobs, or maybe to accurately diagnose a medical ailment.\u00a0 Or maybe even to get a loan.\u00a0 And we want to ensure that we have those sorts of protections in place so that the algorithm doesn't spit out an answer that you just take as the final answer.\u00a0 You have to always balance it with those protections.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Empathy in the product, empathy in the science, I find that really fascinating. \u00a0I think AI especially, maybe it's all the science fiction and Skynet movies and that sort of thing, but like, it feels like that's an important part of the development.\u00a0 And even in the book they talk about maybe there should be a Hippocratic Oath for AI developers and engineers.\u00a0 What would that look like?\u00a0 Are engineers thinking about that right now, thinking about the human side of the equation?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We are.\u00a0 And we think very carefully when we begin to build our AI teams.\u00a0 We want to ensure that the teams look like the population.\u00a0 Because again, that's a way that you can introduce bias.\u00a0 If it was a team full of Peggy Johnsons, it would be the best product for Peggy Johnson but maybe not for you or anybody else in the room.\u00a0 So you have to have this element of empathy in that equation.</p><p>But really, at its core, AI is a tool.\u00a0 I think we're talking so much about all the good it can do and, you know, could it be a doomsday device as well?\u00a0 There's sort of arguments on both ends.\u00a0 I think of it as a tool.\u00a0 And you know, in a very simplistic form, the way a wrench helps you unstick a bolt, it kind of augments your human strength.\u00a0 You can think of AI as augmenting your human intelligence.\u00a0 And it's just a tool.\u00a0 And we should keep it centered there.</p><p>In fact, we were attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, and we happened to have lots of our customers there.\u00a0 I think we went through 60 or 70 meetings in the space of about three days.\u00a0 Every meeting started with the CEO or whoever was on the other side of the table saying, \"What do I do about AI?\u00a0 Tell me about AI.\u00a0 What do I need to know?\"\u00a0 And essentially we came back to, you know, it is a tool.\u00a0 It's a tool that can help you.\u00a0 It can help you in your ability to gain insights from your data.\u00a0 But it's not magic fairy dust, right?\u00a0 You can't just sprinkle it across your business and think things will grow.\u00a0 And that, I think we have to get a little grounded there.\u00a0 It can do a lot of good, and we just have to deploy responsibly.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is a tool.\u00a0 It does have human implications.\u00a0 We saw that in Arizona yesterday with the Uber car; we were talking about that earlier with Tony.\u00a0 What lessons can you take from that, either from the Uber side of it or from just in general sort of self-driving or AI deployment on how you can protect against that kind of sort of fatal loss of life or bad results?\u00a0 And how you can respond as a company when something like that happens.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So first, that was just a tragic accident, and my heart goes out to that family involved.\u00a0 But I think, first and foremost, Uber did the right thing by stopping it.\u00a0 They said, \"Okay, all of this is halted.\u00a0 We need to understand what happened here.\"\u00a0 And that's the right thing to do.\u00a0 Anytime we have a technology, we have to deploy very, very carefully.\u00a0 I'm not close enough to the situation to know what exactly happened.\u00a0 But immediately stopping it is the right thing to do.</p><p>And just as an analogy, we had something similar happen to us.\u00a0 It didn't involve harm to humans, but it did involve-there was an empathetic problem that we had.\u00a0 Essentially, we had introduced a chatbot called Tay.\u00a0 And we were using it to try and understand how natural language input could look inside of an application.\u00a0 So it was really kind of a tool that we were learning with, but we had done something kind of fun with it; we had created this persona of a young-I think she was 19, 20-year-old young woman.\u00a0 And she was kind of hip.\u00a0 But she was all driven by an AI algorithm.</p><p>And what we did is we just want to understand how humans would interact, so you could ask a question using just sort of your normal language, like we're talking here right now, and Tay would respond.\u00a0 And so we put it up on Twitter, and very quickly, within hours, the small group of people had targeted Tay, realized Tay could learn, and trained her to be racist.\u00a0 And immediately, it of course caught our attention and we brought it down immediately.\u00a0 We didn't know what had happened, exactly.\u00a0 But we said, \"This is hurting people.\u00a0 This is offensive.\"\u00a0 And we came back to that core of empathy.\u00a0 This is hurting our users, it's hurting our employees, we're taking it down.</p><p>And so we took it down, and we went back through and kind of analyzed everything, but I want to just share a story that happened the next day.\u00a0 It's very interesting.\u00a0 The team that had worked on it is just a brilliant team of scientists.\u00a0 They're very deep in natural language processing.\u00a0 Just an incredible team that we had internally.\u00a0 Now you can imagine how they felt.\u00a0 They were demoralized.\u00a0 They thought, \"What happened here?\"\u00a0 You know, to their product that they worked so hard on.\u00a0 And again, Satya, our CEO sent them an email and he said, \"Look, first of all, we did the right thing.\u00a0 We were offending people; we took it down.\u00a0 But I want you to know-let's use this as a learning moment.\u00a0 Let's not shelve this technology.\"\u00a0 Because the technology is very, very good.\u00a0 You could imagine it could be answering questions for maybe elderly people who are homebound, and giving them real-world answers to their questions.\u00a0 That's the sort of thing we want to continue to promote.\u00a0 And he said, \"Let's just do a reset.\u00a0 Let's work to understand what went wrong.\u00a0 But know that I have your back.\u00a0 Know that you've done a good thing with this technology.\u00a0 And we're going to keep going.\"</p><p>So, I think it's important to respond quickly, to respond with empathy if something happens, to hopefully ensure that you don't get to that point, but if you do, to take things off the air as quickly as possible.\u00a0 But not to shelve things.\u00a0 I think it's very important.\u00a0 These are tools that can help us solve things like eradicating diseases and finding solutions for poverty, climate change.\u00a0 We don't want to stop that kind of progress.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Tay is an interesting example, and it was sort of early in the process.\u00a0 And we're still seeing it now, even with YouTube elevating a video suggesting some of the kids in Parkland were crisis actors to the top of their trending list.\u00a0 That was sort of a limited use of algorithm, but it was a case where a small number-a seemingly small number of bad actors were able to use a technology for ill.\u00a0 Is there a way that the engineers can be protecting against that kind of misuse of the platform in the first place?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 And I think the way is to assume that this will happen, and then work back from there.\u00a0 Which is why we were pleased to-it started with Satya's set of principles around AI, but now with Future Computed, we've gone deeper on that. \u00a0You have to have these conversations.\u00a0 You can't just build a technology in your lab and unleash it on the world.\u00a0 That's not being responsible.\u00a0 You really want to take the proper steps to ensure that the technology will be used for good, and to assume ways that it might not be, and work back from there.</p><p>So, we try to instill that in our engineers on these development teams, that they again come from a sense of empathy: \"What might go wrong?\u00a0 Let me work back from there so I can prohibit it.\"\u00a0 And by the way, Tay was relaunched as Zo, also a young woman, on the Kik platform, and it has the proper safeguards in place and we haven't had any incidents since then.\u00a0 But it taught us-it trained us [LAUGHS] to understand sort of the limits of the technology, and where humans have to get involved to keep things on the rails.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 You mentioned some of the good use cases of AI, probably that people don't know that much about.\u00a0 And I was reminded this morning, seeing the picture of Jeff Bezos with the Boston Dynamics robot dog-</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Oh yeah.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -that I feel like is probably the most overexposed, over-photographed robot of the modern era.\u00a0 What uses of the technology are being overlooked?\u00a0 And which ones are being sort of overexposed in that way, where we're thinking about it too much?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 So there are already several applications of AI.\u00a0 Even, for instance, the mapping on your phone.\u00a0 That's an underlying application of AI that I think probably most of you really appreciate.\u00a0 I know I do whenever I'm walking around a new city.\u00a0 So there are already many use cases out there, a few of them that I'd love to highlight.</p><p>We just released an app called Seeing AI, and it uses AI for image recognition for blind or low-vision-impaired people who can take their phone with them, and now it sort of gives them some freedom.\u00a0 They can read currency.\u00a0 We've had reports of folks going into grocery stores and finding the right spices for the first time.\u00a0 We had a great story from a young woman who said that she was able to cook dinner that night, having shopped on her own.\u00a0 And so it's opening up doors for people who previously had to maybe rely on another human; now they can be augmented by this AI.\u00a0 I think that one is just a small use case, but to a lot of people it's a very, very important, very freeing opportunity to be able to use that.</p><p>Another one that we were involved in recently is with Adaptive Biotechnologies.\u00a0 They are looking-their endgame is actually to be able to find-to be able to develop a universal blood test to map the auto-or to map your immune system, which you can imagine then could be used for things like autoimmune diseases or early detection of cancer.\u00a0 And the reason that this partnership came together is they're the experts in this area, in studying the immune mapping of humans.\u00a0 The problem is it's a lot of data.\u00a0 It's just massive, massive amounts of data.\u00a0 And if you have to rely sort of just on your standard algorithms, it'll take too long to come to the conclusion that they want, which is this universal blood test.</p><p>So, we teamed up with them, and we are helping them sort through that data, using AI.\u00a0 And that work is underway.\u00a0 And I think it'll be very important work eventually, because the idea with this early blood test is early-or with the blood test is early detection of cancers and trying to understand autoimmune diseases, which are very, very complex.\u00a0 And I think it'll give us some insights in there that we haven't been able to see without having this AI in place.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Okay, I think this is all we've got time for.\u00a0 Last sort of question.\u00a0 Where do you think we're going to be paying attention to these AI stories in the next year, five years?\u00a0 What should we be looking for?</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I do think, as the last story just told, I do think healthcare is an area.\u00a0 I think it's areas that have a lot of data.\u00a0 Those are the areas that now that we can access them and reason across them, we're going to see some impact.\u00a0 So healthcare, I think, in the financial services area.\u00a0 I think in areas like climate change, we have massive amounts of data and we just need the ability to sort through that, and AI is going to be a tool that will allow us to do that.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's good.\u00a0 All right, well, thank you, everybody, for joining us.\u00a0 Next I'd like to welcome my colleague Anna Rothschild.\u00a0 This has been Peggy Johnson.\u00a0 Thanks so much.</p><p>Johnson:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>[APPLAUSE]</p><p>          The Future of Work: AI and Automation       </p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I'm Anna Rothschild.\u00a0 I'm an on-air science reporter for The Washington Post, and I'm also the host of an upcoming science show from The Post called Anna's Science Magic Show Hooray, which is a science variety show geared for kids, parents, and curious people everywhere.</p><p>I am very honored to have these wonderful guests with me today.\u00a0 I'd like to introduce Peter Schwartz.\u00a0 He's a futurist and senior vice president of strategic planning at Salesforce.\u00a0 Mona Vernon is the chief technology officer at Thomson Reuters Labs.\u00a0 And Douglas Terrier is the acting chief technologist at NASA.\u00a0 So, thank you all for being here.\u00a0 And I'd like to remind you all that you can tweet your questions to us using the hashtag #Transformers.\u00a0 So, go for it and make them great.</p><p>So, we're about to talk for half an hour about artificial intelligence and the future of work.\u00a0 But I think if you asked different scientists, they will actually each have different definitions of what they're talking about when they talk about artificial intelligence.\u00a0 So I'd actually like to start by sort of asking each of you, when we're talking about this, about AI and how it will transform work, what are you talking about.\u00a0 And maybe even give some examples from your own work of how we're defining this.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, look.\u00a0 I think-in fact, it was mentioned in the panel with the senators, who I thought were really good, by the way, this morning.\u00a0 I thought they were unusually well-informed and thoughtful.\u00a0 That having been said, having said that, I was actually at the beginning of artificial intelligence research.\u00a0 I started my career at Stanford Research Institute, and then the idea was a top-down model of AI-understand the brain and put it on a chip and that will behave like a human brain.\u00a0 But the problem is, understand the brain.\u00a0 And it's taken us a very long time and we've got a long way to go.</p><p>The new model of artificial intelligence is bottoms-up, and that is let the machine learn rather than teach it.\u00a0 And that now works.\u00a0 And so we are many, many, many instances where we can create the opportunities to use algorithms to make sense of data that actually then perform useful, cognitive functions.\u00a0 That's what we mean by AI today, not the old model of something that looks like a brain put on a microchip.\u00a0 That's why Elon is wrong, by the way.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was going to ask.\u00a0 Do you guys have the same definition, at least for the purposes of the conversation we're having today?</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think so.\u00a0 I think the piece that is really important to bring up, which Peggy mentioned, is that the algorithms have got better for confluence of trends like big data, and that's exactly it.\u00a0 We can train this bottom-up view, like Peter is saying, but it's not just magic; it's about bringing intelligent data, understanding that data, and bringing human expertise to validate those insights.\u00a0 So, this whole conversation about why bias is happening, on argue is that folks forgot the scientific method.\u00a0 Like, there is a way to check your work and put some context around it.\u00a0 So, I agree, but I think it's not just algorithm, it's the combination of the human expertise and the quality of the content that you feed the algorithms.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I would agree.\u00a0 I think, really, we should think of artificial intelligence as augmenting human efforts, not really something that replaces or is a substitute for.\u00a0 So, if you think about the-certainly in our world in space, and in every field of technology, we have volume, veracity and velocity of data that's just overwhelming for humans to deal with, as we see more and more connected smart devices and so on.\u00a0 We have that in our field as well.</p><p>So, we need machines to help us process those volumes of data into real information, into knowledge, in decisions that can help aid human decision-making.\u00a0 And I think that's where artificial intelligence can really be an augmenting tool.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Would you say then that the biggest sort of misconception about artificial intelligence today and how it applies to the future of work is thinking about it as a replacement for humans?</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, I think that's right.\u00a0 Look, I think you're absolutely right.\u00a0 What we're really talking about is augmented intelligence, making people more capable in most instances.\u00a0 Your paper yesterday had a very good article on warehouses-right?\u00a0 On FedEx, et cetera, who are putting robots alongside workers to make them more productive, rather than replace them.\u00a0 And I think we see that.\u00a0 I think one of the great myths right now, for example, is about truck drivers.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 That we're going to eliminate all the truck drivers and taxi cab drivers and replace them with robots.\u00a0 Not true.</p><p>First of all, we need more driving, more truck driving.\u00a0 We are moving to this delivery economy where in front of my house every day at least a dozen trucks go by and half of them stop at my house.\u00a0 My wife's the profession al retail researcher, we call it.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] And at least half of them stop at my house.\u00a0 Having said that, we need more truck driving.\u00a0 And so the truck driver of tomorrow is actually going to behave like the guys who fly remote piloted vehicles today.</p><p>Outside of Las Vegas there's a building where a number of Air Force pilots just go to work every morning and fly drones over Afghanistan and Syria and elsewhere.\u00a0 The truck driver of tomorrow will be like that.\u00a0 They may go out to their garage, get in their truck-driving pod, pick up their first truck-pick up their load, put it on the freeway headed toward Phoenix.\u00a0 They then may pick up the second load, do the same thing headed toward Las Vegas, and so on.\u00a0 They'll drive it around the city streets, supplementing the AI on board, and the AI will drive down the freeway.\u00a0 So, they'll be driving five trucks, not one.</p><p>And in fact, a company in Las Vegas called Starsky Robotics is actually building it right now; they think they can do 10 trucks.\u00a0 I think that's ambitious, but let's say only five trucks.\u00a0 So, more productivity, the truck driver goes home and gets to sleep with their spouse at night, gets to know their kids, doesn't suck fumes all day, and doesn't die in accident.\u00a0 That's the truck driver of tomorrow, and the skill set is Grand Theft Auto.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, Mona, I know that you have maybe some different ideas about which sectors are going to be most impacted.\u00a0 Do you think truck driving and that sort of sector is going to be most impacted, or what's your thought?</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, I'm going to focus on the sector I know.\u00a0 Thomson Reuter serves knowledge workers, and I agree with Douglas that it's about augmenting them.\u00a0 In fact, I talk about giving knowledge workers superpowers.\u00a0 So, let me give you a concrete example.</p><p>Interestingly, data privacy has been in the news in the last couple of days, and one of the challenges for data privacy experts in large companies is that they're dealing with an increasingly complex data privacy regulation environment, and a proliferation of information.\u00a0 So, we did a survey of a thousand data privacy experts, and 44% of them felt that they might fail to comply because it's getting increasingly complex.\u00a0 So, we developed a tool combining the human expertise we have with our legal experts, the quality of data, and feeding into algorithms, to come up with a tool to give data privacy experts this augmentation, this superpower to make sure that, for instance, they don't miss information that they would otherwise be looking for.</p><p>So, there's a discovery feature that's powered by Watson, and combines our data, that helps them make sure they're done doing their research and gives them the feeling of confidence.\u00a0 So, I think that translates into knowledge work.\u00a0 Knowledge workers are going to get superpower with this combination of AI, trained by the right data and validated by experts, and they're just going to be doing more and more exciting things, and perhaps do less of the really boring tasks.\u00a0 So, it is similar to what Peter is talking about, but I think it definitely is going to happen.\u00a0 It's already happening for knowledge work.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there a new skill set that knowledge workers will need to gain in order to do their jobs, or is this just really going to take away the more tedious stuff?</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's how I feel.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do they need to learn to play Grand Theft Auto?       </p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 No, I think it's-if you really think about designing user experiences that could truly understand how a lawyer works or a data privacy expert works, then what they're getting is a tool that gives them superpower; they don't need new skills.\u00a0 Rather, they're not going to do the tedious part of their work, and really focus on what they're really good at.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Look-oh, sorry-</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just wanted to pause because the iPad seems to be missing and I-</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It's right here.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wonderful.\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Sorry.\u00a0 Go on.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Look, I think the point was just made that I think is really quite central.\u00a0 There are going to be jobs; the jobs are going to change; new skills are going to be needed.\u00a0 So, the central task we'd really face is an educational and retaining task.\u00a0 And I think that's the single most important thing.\u00a0 I'm really not at all worried about whether there are going to be good jobs out there, and whether there are going to be opportunities for people.\u00a0 History supports that.</p><p>Look, in 1950, we had 60 million people working; we've got 160 million people working in the United States.\u00a0 We created a hundred million jobs.\u00a0 We're very good at that.\u00a0 The real question is that skills retraining, and here I think the private sector is very important, I think, because most of those people work for us.\u00a0 so, our responsibility is retraining, reskilling, providing the tools for people to be able to actually do that in their jobs, where they work.\u00a0 The opportunity for that 50-year-old truck driver who didn't play Grand Theft Auto to be able to actually be able to drive that new truck.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, I think that's a really, really important point, that this is not something, by the way, that we kind of talk about it like it's about to happen.\u00a0 It's important to realize it is happening, and it's gradually going to continue to happen.\u00a0 And if you think about the jobs that we have today, probably half the jobs that young people are going into didn't exist when I went to college, and that's going to be true when you look into the future.</p><p>So, yes, there will be jobs that will change and the skill set will change, but there will also be myriad jobs that will be created that don't exist today.\u00a0 So, I think there's a lot of opportunity.\u00a0 And I think Peter's point about retaining is really important, and we need to recognize that probably the biggest difference in the way we think about careers today is you go to college, you get one skill set; you're good for a career for life.\u00a0 That is probably a different model where we're going to have to update our skills as the technology continues to change, because as I said, it's going to be a continuous process.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Do you think, then, we need to actually change how, like, our education system in order to adapt throughout our lives?</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I mean, this is about learning, relearning, and relearning.\u00a0 Fortunately, one of the interesting technology trends that's going on is a massive investment in what we call ed tech, educational technologies, to enable people to learn in context, in their work, in their schools, back home, et cetera.\u00a0 And we're spending about $15 billion in investment in the private sector investing in these new technologies.\u00a0 We in Salesforce are investing in something we call Trailhead-allowing our customers and anyone else to learn about the technology on their own, at their own pace.\u00a0 And I think that's the kind of investment that every company is going to need to make.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I think one of the things that we should pint out is that a lot of people think you have to be directly involved in one of these sectors to see the benefit, right?\u00a0 So if you take the work that NASA's invested, for example, over the last decades in artificial intelligence or computers, and if you think about how I got here today with the GPS on my phone, how you operate when you're driving to go visit your relatives-we really all benefit in many ways, and other sectors of the economy benefit from the introduction of these technologies in other fields.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I actually wanted to ask you about this in particular, because we all know that there's so much NASA technology that ends up being repurposed for not space travel, obviously, or other space exploration, and now we're using it in our iPads or in our kitchens.\u00a0 So, are there particular projects that NASA is working on now that you can talk about that you think will have a big impact on all of our lives in the next five, ten years?</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, absolutely.\u00a0 And again, I think it's important to point out that this has been the case for some time, right?\u00a0 So, the first miniaturized computers were developed during the Apollo era, which Peter worked on, to create the capability to do all the processing and augment the human capability to do all those orbital mechanics computations which humans couldn't do.\u00a0 And we continue to do that as we push humans further out into space.</p><p>One example that I think is really interesting is that we, in the search for Earth-like planets we have to use a lot of machine learning and artificial intelligence to process the volumes of data.\u00a0 No human can look at that volume of data and sort out the patterns in it, so we use artificial intelligence to do that.\u00a0 Those same algorithms are used in any big data set when we try to look for patterns.\u00a0 You'd be surprised to learn-so, for example, we use that same kind of processing in doing line set data where we look at crops around the country, where we look at how to reprogram airplane flight paths-those same algorithms are applied there, and in a myriad of other cases.</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I think, to add to Douglas's point, is ITF-I mean, there's still a lot of jobs that we haven't created.\u00a0 So, let's give an example.\u00a0 Companies in the private sectors have hired a lot of data scientists that do usually really well that front end thinking about what is the first use of an algorithm.\u00a0 I'd argue that we need industrial process control through the full life cycle.\u00a0 How do you qualify the quality of the data, your assumption base?\u00a0 How do you then check how the model is improved and evolving over time?\u00a0 Great set of jobs that probably can be created and are fundamentally going to be important to industrialize this technology and deploy it more widely.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How can a company then sort of prove to its customers, to its consumers that its algorithm is working equitably and fairly?\u00a0 I mean-and we don't need to talk about how to actually prevent bias in the data-I mean, how can a company express this to the people they're serving?</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think you've gone to I think perhaps one of the most difficult issues.\u00a0 I'm not worried about AIs taking over and runaway robots, but this is a real issue.\u00a0 And the reason this is an especially difficult issue is because as the algorithm gets more and more sophisticated, it learns, becomes more complex, and frankly, very difficult to unpack why it made the particular recommendations.\u00a0 And if it's made a recommendation that you get credit for your house and you don't, she wants to know why.\u00a0 And that is a challenge of unpacking that algorithm.</p><p>And let me say, I don't think it's easy.\u00a0 I think simply opening the box and looking inside isn't going to tell you very much, because, in fact, the algorithm is not the one we started with; it's evolved itself.\u00a0 So I do think this is a bit of a challenge for the industry, to try and figure out the rules for algorithmic transparency.</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, the way we manage that is we stay really close in the innovation labs with cutting edge technology research, for example, that exact topic Peter talked about is being studied at MIT, the AI lab and the CSAIL, and I think there is a role to continuously ask those questions, but also work really closely with the researchers that are trying to unpack these difficult questions.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I think it's important to say that consumers have a little more power than they might think in this, as well, right?\u00a0 So, when you have humans making these decisions in the current systems, we have choices, and in the free market we're able to choose who we trust, who we don't trust-and as Peter said, it's going to be more difficult because of the complexity of these algorithms-but at the end of the day, I'm confident that the market forces will-that providers that provide the capability that consumers are looking for will rise to the top.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And remember, it is likely that in the end, as we get very good at this, the algorithm will actually be less biased than human beings.\u00a0 The algorithm won't be racist; it won't have attitudes about men and women; it'll look fairly objective.\u00a0 And look, the issue was raised in the very first panel, about the accident that just happened in Tempe.\u00a0 It's important to remember that on that same day that that happened, there were probably 99 humans killed by other humans in accidents, so it was 99 to one in favor of the machine.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, that's a super important point, and I think we are always going to be concerned if there's any software glitch.\u00a0 You know, we're always concerned about any-certainly, a tragedy of human life-but I think that you have to assume that the benefits far outweigh the potential dangers.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, what do you say-I know this was brought up earlier-what do you say when people like Elon Musk say that AI is more dangerous than nukes?</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, well, someday maybe.\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 We're a long way from that understanding of the brain sufficient to give an algorithm, a robot, the kind of autonomy and capacity to make judgments that a human being has, and to do really evil things.\u00a0 We've got a lot of bad people to deal with long before we get to bad robots.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And speaking of bad people, I think that statement's an interesting statement, because if you unpack it-yes, there are things that are very dangerous today, but we have systems in place and responsible legislators and governments that control those things, and we need to have the same kind of process going forward with artificial intelligence.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mona, do you want to comment?</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not adding to that.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER]</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Switching gears a little bit, so much of just our culture generally is sort of forged at the workplace, and I'm wondering how in the future, as AI changes, what jobs exist, where you're actually doing your job, how you think that might change our society generally.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, we have a great example that actually just recently played out in Michigan with Steelcase Furniture.\u00a0 Steelcase is one of the big manufacturers of office furniture-I wouldn't be surprised if everybody here is sitting on a Steelcase chair, it might be possible.\u00a0 And in the 1990s, as rising labor costs grew, Steelcase moved a lot of those jobs for making furniture to Mexico.\u00a0 But what's happened in recent years is they're now bringing a lot of them back to Michigan, and they're pairing workers with robots.\u00a0 The machines are doing the heavy movement and holding in place; the human beings are doing the fine work, and so on.</p><p>And so, what you've done is upgrade those jobs; make them more skilled; paid them better.\u00a0 They've brought back about 80% of the jobs-they've lost a few, but they're better, higher-quality jobs.\u00a0 And what that's telling us is that in many, many instances, some of the more painful, difficult, physical-not only boring, but things that actually wear on workers, that bring them down over the decades, actually are going to be dealt with by the machines.\u00a0 Those areas where human judgment, skill, refinement, capability, control are required-actually, teamwork-the most important skill for a human being is human empathy, the ability to work with other people.\u00a0 It isn't software programming; it is that capacity for collaboration.\u00a0 That's the skill we most need to develop, because that's what will be uniquely human.</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I agree, and I think for me there's a couple of things.\u00a0 One is that if you're a knowledge worker, right?\u00a0 So, if you're a lawyer, you work in finance, or basically your way of making money is using your brain, it's going to be a basis for being competitive to be augmented by these tools.\u00a0 You will see that happen across industry.\u00a0 So, not having it is being left behind.\u00a0 The other piece is, to build really useful AI tools, it fundamentally requires rethinking how we think about design, and I've been really excited to think about this topic, which is how do you design useful tools to help knowledge workers be more effective?\u00a0 And that's not something that today a robot can do.</p><p>So, one is the adoption of those tools is going to become table stake and a basis for competition, so it will change the workplace for knowledge workers.\u00a0 And the second, for those of us that are building those tools, being really able to be impacting to bring a design-thinking approach to it is going to be a critical aspect to get those tools adopted.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Are there particular things that you think we should be doing, then, to foster these-I know this is kind of a silly thing to say, but to foster thinking about empathy in the workplace, in order to create people who can work better with AI in the future?</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, look, the book, Emotional Intelligence, a number of years ago, by Dan Goldman, I think was really quite a profound shift-that is to recognize that intelligence also has its emotional components, and that it can be developed, it can be trained, it can be tested for.\u00a0 And you can actually work with your own workforce to make them more emotionally intelligent, and therefore, much more productive.\u00a0 So, I think we actually do have the tools to be able to make that human workforce much more capable of collaborating with other humans using machines.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, it's really interesting when you think about how far we've come in such a short period of time.\u00a0 One of the things that Alan Turing in the '50s proposed, this test for AI, which is you can't distinguish the machine from a human being, right?\u00a0 So, that's a really interesting concept, not necessarily the way we think about it today, but it's important, when you think about this emotional relationship.\u00a0 So, this is the first generation that's coming up now that will live and work among intelligent machines as an integral part of their team, and I think that has profound implications in society and in the way our workplace operates.</p><p>We have a situation at NASA which is, for many years now we've had where we're again extending human capabilities through artificial intelligence and robots on Mars or through our observatories in space.\u00a0 We very much consider those machines as part of the team, and the way the team interacts with that has been really interesting to watch, how that's evolved over time.\u00a0 And I think as we get more sophisticated in machines, we'll build in that empathy and that humanlike quality in the machine to help that relationship work better.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would love to know a little bit more about how the people who are actually working with these machines-whether they're ascribing human emotion to them at this point.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, I'll tell you a really interesting story.\u00a0 I've work primarily for most of my career in the human space flight arena, and when we have a launch or we have a dynamic event, there's a lot of emotion in the control room because of the concern about human life.\u00a0 I had the opportunity to be out at the jet propulsion lab when we were landing one of the curiosity rovers, one of the rovers on Mars, and the tension and the hope and the prayers and the emotion in that room were just as palpable because of the connection that people had with that machine they'd invested decades of their life in designing.\u00a0 So, yeah, it's very much a real relationship.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, that Mars lander, the vehicle that came in that was one of the great AI achievements of engineering, one of the all-time greats, and they managed to pull it off the first time, the only time it was every done.\u00a0 It was one of the great achievements by NASA.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The thing that's sort of complicate, though, is the minute that we start kind of ascribing emotion to a machine, this is where we get into the territory that I think scares people.\u00a0 And I just wonder-</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, but we used to name our cars-you know, I was a car guy when I was a kid, right?\u00a0 And people named their cars Betsy and Bill and stuff like that.\u00a0 We've had these kinds of relationships with machines that we share.\u00a0 We probably didn't name our washing machines, but our cars had kind of character to them, and they identified with who we were.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many people have hit their computer when it was giving trouble, right?\u00a0 The computer actually doesn't care; that's about you.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But that's just to fix it.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, it actually doesn't, but it makes us feel better.\u00a0 And the point is that the emotional component is actually not a function of the machines.\u00a0 This is not something that we need to worry about the machine; this is actually our issue that we need to deal with.</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And that's just-add to Douglas's point earlier-this is not-I don't think we're sitting at a change-it's a continuous evolution, right?\u00a0 Many of us have had components of AI technology in our products in the last 25 years; it just so happens that for some reason there is an excitement around that buzzword today because of how mature it's getting.\u00a0 But it has been a slow evolution.\u00a0 Your iPad is powered by AI; it was powered by AI five years ago.\u00a0 We just talked about big data and the cloud and not necessarily this.\u00a0 So, what that means is that we have a continuous opportunity to get used to the more powerful tool they're augmenting us.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, I think that's a really great point, and I think that if you look at-you know, very, very simple things, when you push that button that says potato on your microwave, that machine's doing a lot of sensing, a lot of decisions about what time to-when you hit the brake on your car, hundreds of times per second the car is measuring the rotation speed of the wheels and making a decision-you're not actually controlling that brake; the machine's doing that for you.\u00a0 And we get used to these things, as Peter said, because the outcome is better for us that we stopped quicker and more safely.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm a pilot.\u00a0 Yesterday I flew here; I didn't fly my own plane here, but an AI flew me here, except for about 20 minutes, the take off and the landing.\u00a0 And the AI could have done that.\u00a0 But, having said that, the autopilot flew the plane across country.\u00a0 Every one of us does that all the time, and we never think about it.\u00a0 We're so-I completely agree-this is a continuum that we have been moving toward over a long time.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 We only have a few minutes left, and I would love to talk about the impact of AI sort of internationally.\u00a0 So, first of all, I'm curious to know how you think AI will sort of transform industry in the developing worlds in the next few years.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, look, first of all, I think this is a technology that is increasingly accessible to many people.\u00a0 It used to be a thing that existed in the laboratory.\u00a0 But many companies-Amazon, ourselves, Microsoft, Google-are all providing the tools for the public to be able to use.\u00a0 And that means in places like Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, there are young academics, young start-ups, actually picking up these tools and inventing new ways of, for example, distributing medicines in Africa using drones and AI to get to the incredibly remote locations that they wouldn't have been able to otherwise.\u00a0 And so you're seeing this wave of young entrepreneurs that are actually picking up the new tools and creating new kinds of products and services that would not have been possible otherwise.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, that's a really great point.\u00a0 And I think we, even at NASA, for example, one of the things that we have is we have outposts where we're putting humans.\u00a0 We're trying to put humans all the way out to Mars, so we need to put a lot of intelligence that normally would reside in a control room here on Earth, we need to make that available, whether it's doctors, medicine, technical information, so on, in artificial intelligence systems because of the light time.\u00a0 That same technology is available to remote medicine, to austere areas where people are separated by great distances, to enable them to have access to all the technology.</p><p>And I think in many ways, just this technology in general is a great equalizer internationally, for particularly the underdeveloped countries that don't have the traditional industrial infrastructure.\u00a0 They can leapfrog that and jump right into this arena.</p><p>Vernon:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I agree.\u00a0 I think the way to think about it is, under the umbrella of AI is the maturity of a set of digital technologies that now can really help emerging markets leapfrog.\u00a0 So, we talked about mobile, social, which is a lot of data and connecting people through a proliferation of data.\u00a0 AI is that component that brings it all together and really creates digital first solutions that are truly innovative across many, many sectors.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And look, learning in the developing world is the-like for us, but even more important in that part of the world to actually see the opportunities to develop.\u00a0 And the new leaning technologies universally distributed make a really remarkable opportunity.\u00a0 Wikipedia is the greatest antipoverty tool ever created.\u00a0 Any kid on the planet with a device like this now has all the world's knowledge available to them.</p><p>So, I think we're in an era that enables AI to enable education, learning, and productivity all over the planet.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And do you think it will help connect the kid with the iPad maybe someplace in Africa to-</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Absolutely.</p><p>Schwartz:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 I think it is.</p><p>Terrier:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think it already is.\u00a0 The social networks are borderless, right?\u00a0 And I think Peter's point is really important, that it's, again, a great equalizer.\u00a0 Kids anywhere can have access to all the world's information, and that is a remarkable, remarkable tool, and step forward.</p><p>Rothschild:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Great.\u00a0 Well, we are about at the end of our time.\u00a0 I just want to thank you all so much for being here.\u00a0 This was a great discussion.</p><p>We are going to take a quick break, but the next part of our program will begin momentarily.\u00a0 Thank you so much.</p><p>[APPLAUSE]</p><p>          Content from Software.org: the BSA Foundation: Sponsor Segment: Maximizing the Benefits of AI       </p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 Hi, everyone.\u00a0 I'm Tammy Haddad, here with Victoria Espinel.\u00a0 Put your phones down, because she's the guru.\u00a0 Let's hear it for Victoria.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE] Okay, somebody left this.\u00a0 Is this a hint?\u00a0 Are these questions I'm supposed to ask?\u00a0 All right, I'll just leave it over here.</p><p>Thank you so much for being with us.\u00a0 We've heard so many amazing things.\u00a0 But you can put your hones back on, because you're going to want to write down everything she says.\u00a0 Victoria was the nation's first chief intellectual property enforcement-were you an office or a coordinator?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coordinator.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coordinator, no officers in the Obama administration.\u00a0 And she runs BSA, the software alliance.\u00a0 She is talking to world leaders, she is talking to the greatest scientists, the greatest companies, about what's going on.\u00a0 It's a privilege to be here with you.\u00a0 And I have to ask you first-we're talking about artificial intelligence, obviously, but can we just back it up and talk about what is happening, who is doing it, and how they're doing it?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's great.\u00a0 So, thanks, Tammy, and thanks to everyone for being here today.\u00a0 So, artificial intelligence, at its essence, is built on data on lots and lots of data, on much more data than human beings can process themselves-although you can process a lot of data, Tammy-but more data than most human beings can process.\u00a0 And so, when people talk about artificial intelligence, and when they talk about how to build it and train it correctly, a lot of what they're talking about is-what that means-is how do you make sure that the information, the data, that is being used to build or create or train the artificial intelligence is as good as it possibly can be?\u00a0 How can you make sure it's as accurate and complete as it can be?</p><p>Because if the data that is used to train the artificial intelligence is incomplete in some way, then the output is going to be skewed.\u00a0 So, when people talk about bias in artificial intelligence, really what they're talking about is, how do you try to make sure that the information and the data that is being used to train the artificial intelligence is as good as it possibly can be?\u00a0 And there's a few different things in my opinion that need to happen in order to make sure that that happens.\u00a0 But really, bias-eliminating bias in artificial intelligence is about trying to make sure that the data that goes into it is as good as it possibly can be.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, is that people?\u00a0 Is that code?\u00a0 I mean, is there a code of ethics? \u00a0How do you do it?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, there's not yet a code of ethics.\u00a0 That is something that a lot of companies, including Software.org companies are talking about.\u00a0 But I think it's a few things.\u00a0 So, part of it is people; part of it is making sure that the data scientists inside the companies are trained as well as they possibly can be.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Who trains them?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But, a big part of that-I think probably a bigger issue-is trying to make sure that the information is as good as it can be.\u00a0 And in my mind, there's at least two different components of that.\u00a0 One is, trying to have as much information as possible.\u00a0 So, if part of that is, for example, trying to get the government to share all the information that it has with companies that can use it in order to make sure that what they're building is as good as possible.</p><p>Another part of it is trying to make sure that those that are trained in the AI themselves have a diversity of backgrounds and experiences.\u00a0 So, something that I feel very strongly about is, you have software that's disrupting the world, artificial intelligence is disrupting the world.\u00a0 And when it's being developed, created, built, trained-whatever words you want to use-the people at the table have to have a wide range of experiences and perspectives in order for it to be as good as it possibly can be, and that is something where we need to do more work.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, that's my question.\u00a0 How do you do that work?\u00a0 We already know there's STEM programs, there's a variety-how do you get more diversity?\u00a0 Because that's really what you're talking about.\u00a0 More diversity of opinion, experience-how do you get that into the program?\u00a0 We all know, right?\u00a0 We all agree there needs to be more diversity.\u00a0 Do we agree?\u00a0 Okay.\u00a0 So, how can you do that?\u00a0 I mean, because you're talking about taking this entire industry, all of the companies, governments, everyone around the world, together, are trying to design-they're making these decisions, right?\u00a0 So, how do you add that in, in advance?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, I don't think-like anything that's complicated, there's not going to be a single answer.\u00a0 But here are a few ideas.\u00a0 One is, I think it's really important that governments-and I would include that of the United States government-be rethinking the educational system to make sure that at a young age children are being exposed to coding, computer science, as early as possible.\u00a0 And that won't just help get more girls into coding-which is part of the issue that we have-but it will also I think help ensure that we have the promise of economic opportunity coming from this spread out across the United States.</p><p>So, my dream would be that any young person, regardless of where they live in the United States, it is a feasible future for them to go into this area if they want to be.\u00a0 And that is not the reality today.\u00a0 So, part of it is focusing on gender, but part of it, I think, is very much focusing on making sure that anywhere that you sit in the United States, this is an opportunity that you have, and there's a lot of work to be done there.</p><p>And so, I think government has a big role to play in terms of educational curriculums.\u00a0 You know, the industry, the tech industry and the software industry has already been doing a lot in terms of programs that we're supporting.\u00a0 And that's great, and that will continue, and we will be doing even more.\u00a0 But I also don't think it should be-and it's not good for society for it to be kind of on the tech industry alone, so I think it needs to be the tech industry and the government trying to work together.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, that's funny, because one of the issues in the large picture of the culture today is that people are looking at their company that they work for-whether it's GE or Under Armour, or you name it-to help them, to advance them.\u00a0 You should be giving me more job opportunities.\u00a0 My success is going through the I call it the Daddy CEO situation, but it's actually double in AI, right?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 And just to divert for a moment.\u00a0 I think one thing that's really important is that when we in the software industry are talking about training people for new jobs, we are not necessarily talking about training them to get jobs at software companies.\u00a0 I mean, that happens, too, but more what we're talking about is training people to get jobs that use tech skills or digital skills, either in the company that they are in, or the company that they want to join, regardless of what sector that is.\u00a0 Every sector out there is using software today.\u00a0 And so the training that we are giving people will help them get jobs across industry sectors, not just in ours.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, that's why I want to go back to the economic opportunities, and the application of all this.\u00a0 So, you've done it.\u00a0 You've got more of a diverse workforce; you've got more buys.\u00a0 How will all of this be implemented at companies all across the world?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, companies right now are hungry for people with these skills.\u00a0 I think an issue that we need to figure out, though, is we have employer demand and we have people that are eager to get these skills.\u00a0 What we don't have yet-and hopefully this is something where software and tech can help-is a great matching of those.\u00a0 So, where employers need people and where there are people that have those skills and want those jobs-how do we make sure that they are coming together?</p><p>And a part of that, also, is thinking about whether or not-and again, I think software can be really helpful here-can we spread out those job opportunities across the United States?\u00a0 One of the things that software lets you do is work from anywhere, and that we haven't really exploited yet, the opportunities that that could bring workers and try to get access to jobs either in tech companies or in other types of companies, wherever they are.\u00a0 In other words, bring the jobs to the people rather than making people go to the jobs.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is that a gift of AI?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think that is a gift of software generally, but I think artificial intelligence is one of the areas where-that is one of the benefits that artificial intelligence could bring.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And is there a program that you see right now that's looking in any of the companies or governments-maybe when you were in the Obama administration-that are looking at bias this closely and trying to come up with solutions?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, yes, there definitely are people that are looking at it.\u00a0 The companies that we work with are looking at it intensely.\u00a0 But here's-because I know we don't have that much time-here's another element of this that I want to talk to.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two minutes.</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, we've talked a lot, and we will continue to talk, and we should, about how you train artificial intelligence to make sure that it is unbiased-and that is something that absolutely has to happen.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do you do that?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And part of that is making sure that the information that goes into it is as complete and as accurate and reflects a diversity of experiences.\u00a0 But that's about creating artificial intelligence.\u00a0 I think what we also need to be thinking and talking about, and I hear lots of discussion of, is, okay, now it's been created.\u00a0 How do you use it in a way that eliminates bias, and how do you use artificial intelligence in a way that broadens inclusion?</p><p>So, I'm going to give one example that I think is really tremendous, but this is just an example.\u00a0 And there are so many it's hard to pick.\u00a0 So, now I'm upset at myself that I limited myself to one-but just to give one.\u00a0 There are companies that are using artificial intelligence to help people with autism who are not as good at recognizing facial cues as others, to be able to use artificial intelligence so that when they are interacting they are getting a correct interpretation of the emotions of the person that they are speaking to.\u00a0 And if that can happen in a way that is seamless, it will transform people with autism or Asperger's ability to interact in the world.\u00a0 For one thing, it will open up career opportunities for them that don't exist today.\u00a0 But even in just their daily life and their interactions with their friends and their families and their relationships, it will change their lives in a way that will be so fundamental.\u00a0 And that is one example of a way that artificial intelligence could be used to broaden inclusion.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 That's pretty exciting.\u00a0 Well, the other thing is, that totally changes the workforce, right?</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Completely changes the workforce.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Because you are now bringing intelligent people from another part of society right into the middle of things.</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So, if we-one more example?</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have one more minute.\u00a0 They're not going to come out for another minute.</p><p>Espinel:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 One more example, really quickly, that is even more directly related to workforce is, companies right now are using artificial intelligence to rethink their hiring strategies, including how they advertise for their jobs, to make sure that the way that they are seeking employees doesn't have some sort of hidden bias that they themselves may be entirely unaware that the way that they're advertising for jobs and the way that they are seeking employees has a bias in it that is skewing it to be more attractive or appealing to certain types of people.</p><p>So they're using artificial intelligence right now to look at their hiring practices and try to ferret out of them any hidden bias that might be in there.\u00a0 And that is, I think, another area that is really exciting.\u00a0 That is, all of these things are nascent-you know, they're not-they are either only just starting to be deployed or not even being deployed yet-and I think this is just the tip of the iceberg, in terms of the applications of artificial intelligence to reduce bias.</p><p>So, fundamental is we need to build it in a way that is unbiased, but then we need to use it in a way that will reduce bias.</p><p>Haddad:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much, Victoria Espinel.\u00a0 Terrific job.\u00a0 [APPLAUSE] Now I'm going to hand it back to The Washington Post.\u00a0 Thank you so much.</p><p>          Using AI Responsibly: One-on-one with IBM's Dario Gil       </p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I am happy to introduce this time, Dario Gil, vice president of AI at IBM, a company everybody has heard of.\u00a0 We're going to be discussing artificial intelligence and responsibility.\u00a0 And once again, I ask you, if you use Twitter, to tweet question to us using the hashtag #Transformers, not the movie.</p><p>So let's get into it.\u00a0 I feel like now would be a good time, now that we've figured out that AI can solve all these problems, to probably get a reality check on where we are in the status of the technology and what we're going to be looking at in a couple years.</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I think that's right because we tend to oscillate with an enormous level of enthusiasm and ambition.\u00a0 And sometimes, we think ahead too much, right?\u00a0 So let's put it a little bit in context of where we are in AI.</p><p>Thanks to actually the fruit of many decades of progress, I would say that we're in a forum where a narrow form of artificial intelligence has begun to work.\u00a0 And what that means is that for very specific tasks and objections.\u00a0 Like, let's say, classifying what may be in a picture, or being able to do good, but narrow forms of speech recognition.\u00a0 We have gotten the technology to be good enough.\u00a0 So that's this narrow form of AI.</p><p>Bookend it to sort of like the more utopian or dystopian discussions that people have, that's what they refer to as \"artificial general intelligence.\"\u00a0 That's, by all accounts, many, many decades away.\u00a0 But that speaks about a form of intelligence that is more a kind of human intelligence, where you can solve problems across arbitrary tasks, and domains, and you can keep learning.\u00a0 You have a high degree of autonomy in your actions.\u00a0 So that's the other bookend.</p><p>And in between, we're entering a new phase that we refer to as \"broad AI,\" which is how do we go from this from very narrow and segmented capabilities that we have today-that are powerful, but very narrow-to the ability to do and solve more tasks.\u00a0 Meaning, give me an example.\u00a0 If I learn to perform a task, is it easier for me to perform an adjacent task, something that is close by, or do every time I have to learn a new task, do I have to start from scratch?\u00a0 Do I have to build a new AI system?</p><p>I think being able to do this so that we can do broader and broader tasks, that we can partner better with people to complement their expertise, to make it more transparent, is this realm of broad AI that we're entering.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And even with the narrow AI that we're into right now, there's a question of responsibility for who develops it, and who should take responsibility for the ethics of it; the guidelines that establish how it should be created.\u00a0 Who should have the responsibility for that?\u00a0 Should it be the engineers?\u00a0 Should it be the regulators down the street?\u00a0 Should it be the consumer that sort of votes with the pocketbook?\u00a0 Where should that debate be happening?</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I think it needs to happen.\u00a0 It's a multi-stakeholder process.\u00a0 Because at the root of AI is what is its purpose.\u00a0 What are trying to solve?\u00a0 It could not be a discussion just about the raw technology.\u00a0 So if you're doing the context of AI for healthcare, you need to be able to operate within the constraints of the healthcare profession, which are there also for good reasons.\u00a0 And so there are many stakeholders that will be there.\u00a0 They will be stakeholders-are the physicians.\u00a0 Regulators are a part of it.\u00a0 And AI needs to fit into that context, and the responsibility have to come across all of those stakeholders.</p><p>The creator of it has to take responsibility for what is the algorithm doing.\u00a0 What data-who trains these systems has a lot of implications for the outcome of the system.\u00a0 So I think that where we are entering a phase is that this sort of like narrow discussion about to have a neural network, and here I show you an example that it does a good job classifying this particular task in healthcare, or these other area, and it gets a lot of headlines; needs to move towards a responsible use of AI in professions, and within specific industry context.</p><p>So I think that we got to go to the point where we're saying, \"Don't talk to me only about the technology.\u00a0 Who are you as a company?\u00a0 What trust do you have?\u00a0 What responsibility are you taking into this process?\u00a0 And do you understand the context in which AI is going to applied?\"\u00a0 And the principles have to be a set of principles-are based on-one of it is purpose.\u00a0 What are you trying to do with it?\u00a0 At IBM, we take the point of view that AI has to be augmenting human intelligence, not replacing human intelligence.\u00a0 So purpose is one.</p><p>The second one has to do with trust.\u00a0 And we basically, our position is, \"Okay.\u00a0 Whose data is coming into train it?\"\u00a0 We take also the position that the institutions that are providing the data are the owners of that data.\u00a0 Or in the case of it's of an individual, that it is their data, and therefore we don't want to use it for other adjacent purposes, but only to what has been claimed for.\u00a0 And how do we provide accountability to the algorithms that have been developed to train it?</p><p>And the third dimension is skills.\u00a0 How do we also invest in the technology so that it's complimentary to the skills of the professionals or the individuals who will be using it.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 Let's dig in on healthcare a little bit because I find that industry especially fascinating.\u00a0 It touches everybody's lives, and yet, you know, we're still talking about moving from paper to digital records.\u00a0 And there's all sorts of questions about data privacy, really important HIPAA guidelines, and even just getting doctors to buy into that kind of system.\u00a0 Where do we sit with AI in healthcare?\u00a0 What are the opportunities and what are especially kind of the perils for moving too quickly into that?</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is extraordinarily early days.\u00a0 I think you alluded to the fact that prior technologies advances have also-you know, we've seen the implications in healthcare that they've been adopted.\u00a0 But we've also seen that sometimes the pace of adoption takes a long, long time.\u00a0 And that's the reality today.\u00a0 I think undoubtedly-you know, I'll speak more from a research side, which is my responsibility, we have a lot of evidence that AI will have a lot of profound implications in the practice of medicine.</p><p>It will have implications in the areas of discovery for life sciences.\u00a0 You just look at the sheer amount of genomic information that is available, and how we will actually go and make sense, and connect it to disease progression-will be important.\u00a0 You will have important implications-we don't know in the areas, for example, like radiology, and so on, in oncology, in value-based care.\u00a0 But to make progress, we've got to deliver evidence.\u00a0 We have to be able to put the systems and validate them scientifically and rigorously.\u00a0 And it is through the demonstration of the results and published results that we will see an increase adoption.</p><p>And that is just like the practice of science in general, right?\u00a0 There's no shortcuts to that.\u00a0 You just have to do the heavy lifting and the work to prove that the technology's affective, that it solves problems, and that it provides a value added to the institution, to the individual, to the physician.\u00a0 But adoption of it, it also has to do with this element of trust.\u00a0 If the physicians and the practitioners don't believe that this is in the best interest, let's say in this case, of the patient, but also they have a consideration of their financial and professional interest, it is very hard to get it adopted.</p><p>So those are all the barriers that have to overcome, but there is no doubt that it is a big consensus in the community that it will have a very profound and positive impact if we do it well.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I want to talk about that tension between the adoption and the marketing.\u00a0 The marketing for the AI is very high; almost sometimes overlaps what the actual product can do.\u00a0 You know, IBM with Watson, it was sort of pitched as this kind of revolutionary, cancer care solution.\u00a0 But last year there was a partnership canceled with MD Anderson Cancer Center, where there was a big investment from IBM's point of $60 million.\u00a0 And there was a question of whether the technology was overpromised and that it underdelivered to the doctors or the patients.</p><p>Can you help me understand how we should be thinking about tension points like that, when there is a question of how effective the product is?\u00a0 And help us understand IBM's thinking about how to move forward on that.</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 At any time one introduces a technology that is going to have a very, very broad impact in the world, there is indeed always a tension between communicating sort of the broad impact that the technology will have in society, and getting everybody, all the stakeholders, to think about what does it mean; where is this going to go?\u00a0 And I think we would not question the fact that AI, if you ask today, right-all the leading technology players, and not just technology players, companies-where would rate different technologies in the level of sort of impact to the world.\u00a0 I bet most of us would rate AI at the number one position today.</p><p>If you look at that today, and then you say, well, what is the impact that it's going to have across different professions, including healthcare, I think both the healthcare professionals and the technology companies would say also it's going to have an extraordinary impact.\u00a0 Then the question is, where are we in the progression, right, which you asked for.\u00a0 And the honest answer is we're in the early days.\u00a0 And in the early days, you require pioneers to experiment with things.\u00a0 And you try things out, and you demonstrate what works and what doesn't.\u00a0 And in the course of doing that is how you make progress.\u00a0 And there's no way to shortcut this.</p><p>We were chatting before about self-driving cars.\u00a0 Well, what is the impact that that is going to have?\u00a0 Are there going to be difficulties, yes, but do we believe that over time those difficulties can be overcome?\u00a0 The answer is yes.\u00a0 So today, right, we have, you know, a very thriving and very successful business applying AI to health, where there's tens of thousands of patients are being impacted and benefited by partnering artificial intelligence-in this case, our Watson solutions in health-with practitioners in doing this.</p><p>So I don't think we can sort of like judge the level of progress by a specific project where there's a lot of convoluted facts that take place there.\u00a0 But what is the actual progress that is being made in the field?\u00a0 And in this narrow form of AI that I was alluding to, undoubtedly, even with the current capabilities to understand documents limited, to be able to process images, to be able to segment a new classification, I would say in the life sciences, there's enormous value to be created.\u00a0 And that is being recognized, and that is the reason why in healthcare-and we're not the only ones saying this.\u00a0 I mean, I think it was brought up here in the panel.</p><p>When I think the community speaks about what is the likelihood of the biggest impact that we're likely to see in AI in industries, kind of everybody's saying healthcare is very, very important.\u00a0 It has a lot of implications.\u00a0 And the reality is we've been pioneers on this, and we have a very successful business, and growing that.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And just to riff-I appreciate your point on that-do you feel like the companies do overpromise sometimes?\u00a0 I mean, do you feel like that is a problem for not just you all, but a lot of companies-[OVERLAPPING]</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 I would say in just a general statement, AI right now is at an extraordinary level of hype.\u00a0 And again, over the long run, I do think that AI will have that transformative effect on society.\u00a0 But you know what's happened too, and I'm sort of seeing in the discussion here today, but broadly, is I like to say now that AI is the new IT.\u00a0 And what I mean by that is that all the projects that we used to ascribe to information technology, and analytics, or automation, now they're being lumped into AI.</p><p>So if you take a more like narrow definition of AI, and you go and say, well, within AI, we have a subfield called \"neural networks,\" and within that we have techniques like deep learning.\u00a0 And then you ask for all the categories that people are saying this is AI solving this and that, even if you take that narrow form and you say, well, are you using?\u00a0 Are you employing in this solution, say, neural networks, as an example of deep learning?\u00a0 I bet you would filter the claims that are being made by 98%; right, of what people are claiming is AI will be much narrower.</p><p>So what happens is that the word \"AI\" has become a substitution for a lot of other fields, right, that have been lumped in, just because of its excitement.\u00a0 And as a result of that, you have this tension of when you're speaking as a scientific, you know, as a researcher, you say, \"Well, what is the actual rate of progress of what AI is doing?\"\u00a0 But when we popularly talk about AI, we are lumping all sorts of other things into it.\u00a0 So you have this difficult tension, right?</p><p>Well, on the one hand, the public is experiencing, it seems like AI is everywhere.\u00a0 It seems AI is touching everything.\u00a0 And that leads to a lot of excitement.\u00a0 And then when you go into the detail and say what is the actual state of the art in AI, you recognize the fact that even though amazing progress has been made, it is still narrow in its capability.\u00a0 And our mission is to advance that capability to keep up with the desire to apply it.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Late last year you made the joyful march to Capitol Hill to talk with the Senate committee on commerce about AI regulation.\u00a0 You said, \"Regulatory issues should not stand in the way of AI.\u00a0 It's the most important technology industry in the world today.\"\u00a0 We've seen the industry itself police over the last couple years.\u00a0 We've seen the issues that have come from that.\u00a0 Where do you feel like the barrier should be erected, or the line should be drawn for creating a regulation that could prevent some of these problems?\u00a0 Or do you feel like it should be a question for industry, a question for consumers?</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think that each company that is creating AI and putting AI services and capability out there needs to be accountable and needs to be responsible.\u00a0 So the theme needs to be responsible AI, right?\u00a0 And there are companies-and I don't want to lump everybody in the same basket because I'm very proud of the company I work for, and our stance, and we've been doing information technology for over a century.\u00a0 And we have built that reputation based on trust, and doing the right thing as far as data is concerned, and the products that we put out, and standing behind them.</p><p>So I think if there are actors who are not properly addressing bringing forth AI products or managing data with the same level of responsibility, I think that that is something that both the consumers, and the users, and the partners, and regulators, you know, will have-they'll have to stand behind what they do.\u00a0 So I think that we have to continue to study the implications.\u00a0 And when there's bad actors, there needs to be pressure to correct the bad actions.\u00a0 But we cannot lump that everybody's in the same basket, and this is the Wild West, and everybody's doing and their responsible, because it's not the case.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 We are running out of time, but I want to close with an example of a little bit of a tiff at an AI conference recently-and you can imagine how rowdy those get-where there was talk of this predictive policing algorithm that was designed to take in data and establish which members of the community were potential gang members based off crime, and social networks, and that sort of thing.</p><p>People began asking about kind of the unintended side effects, including potentially falsely labeling people as gangsters, even when they weren't.\u00a0 And one of the engineers on that said, \"Those aren't my problems.\u00a0 I'm just an engineer.\"\u00a0 Help me understand where the responsibility should lie in those questions.\u00a0 Should the engineers be thinking about those, even back in the preparation of these algorithms, or should those be questions for someone else?</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Of course they have to be thinking about them, right?\u00a0 I mean, to me, I find comments like that kind of funny because it's as if like, you know, some of these technical folks have landed on Earth with no other connection of understanding, right, [LAUGHTER] of like we live in a society, and we have responsibility to others.\u00a0 And there's fields like moral philosophy that has been with us for a long, long time.</p><p>We have to continue to demand that practitioners in the field be human beings and are educated and sophisticated in understanding that we live in a society with rules and we depend on each other.\u00a0 So, of course, that is like a totally irresponsible sort of like way of thinking, in my opinion.\u00a0 And in the course of creating technology, then you have to do it in the context in which it's going to be applied.\u00a0 So if you're going to apply AI in the criminal justice system, you have to involve all the other stakeholders who have thought about these issues.</p><p>So this kind of like, in a way, you know, even though I'm a scientist and a technologist and I like it, we cannot give undue power or undue mythical capabilities to the scientists and the technologies.\u00a0 We are part of a much broader set of principles and an ecosystem.\u00a0 We have to have teams that have all those dimensions.\u00a0 And technology is neither our savior nor our demise, right?\u00a0 It has to be in the context of what we, as humans in a democratic society with the rules that we impose on ourselves through government and so on, practice how we create technology and for what purpose.</p><p>So I take the view that we have to have a very humanist perspective on how we develop technology, and not glorify technology for its own sake.\u00a0 It's a means to an achievement, to what we want to do.\u00a0 So, no, yahoos saying, \"I'm going to solve the criminal problem because I have an algorithm.\"\u00a0 It's a very sort of-in a way, it's a form of illiteracy, but of a sort of broader humanist understanding of what we're here to do.</p><p>Harwell:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Well, on that note, thank you so much for having us.\u00a0 I'm going to turn it over to three other very smart people and Jeremy Gilbert for The Post.\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>Gil:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.</p><p>          AI and Ethics: People, Robots and Society       </p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All right.\u00a0 Good morning.\u00a0 I'm Jeremy Gilbert.\u00a0 I'm the director of strategic initiatives here at The Washington Post, and I'm thrilled to moderate our last panel of the morning on the ethical and social implications of artificial intelligence.\u00a0 I'm joined by a real esteemed panel of experts.\u00a0 Jack Clark is the director of communications and strategy at OpenAI, which is a non-profit AI research company.\u00a0 Meredith Whittaker is the co-founder and executive director of the AI Now Institute at NYU University.\u00a0 And Milind Tambe is the founding co-director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, and the director of Teamcore Research Group on Artificial Intelligence and Multiagent Systems at the University of Southern California.\u00a0 Thank you all for being here.</p><p>If you have any questions for our speakers, please tweet them to us using the #Transformers and I'm going to get the discussion started right now.\u00a0 So this is an interesting group with some very different perspectives.\u00a0 But one of the things that seems to unite you is the importance of the impact of artificial intelligence.\u00a0 The kind of question of how we weigh, for example, what large institutions might have as business interests using artificial intelligence, versus societal good.</p><p>How do we decide who gets to be the beneficiary of the gains of artificial intelligence when we're weighing those two things?</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So you're starting with the easiest question?</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [LAUGHS] Of course.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I guess I'll start and we'll go down.\u00a0 But OpenAI was founded a little over two years ago.\u00a0 And the goal of OpenAI is to ensure that the benefits of advanced AI accrue sort of widely to all of humanity, rather than just a few.\u00a0 I think that everyone on this stage shares that idea.\u00a0 It's interesting to me that such an organization was formed at this time because it suggests that there is huge anxiety that it's going to happen in the other way and we're not going to see those benefits widely distributed.\u00a0 And I think that there's a responsibility for the AI community centers to try and play a larger role in the kind of governance and the defining of norms around this technology so that it can go well.\u00a0 And there's huge anxiety, but the default setting is currently one whether a private industry gets to define the rules of something, which affects everyone, which I think we should be somewhat nervous about.</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah, I would hard agree on that.\u00a0 The AI Now Institute at NYU, I co-founded that with Kate Crawford in part because we want to look at what is AI doing now?\u00a0 What are the impacts that are happening right now as early AI systems are being rolled into the infrastructures of our daily lives?\u00a0 So in response to this question, I want to bring it back down to the practical.\u00a0 I would agree with what Jack said, but at this point, we don't even have an accounting for where these systems are integrated into the backends of core decisions.\u00a0 And this is why the AI Now Institute called for an elimination of black box systems.\u00a0 So this is sort of unaccountable, obscure systems not subject to oversight, as used in core government agencies.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How many of these black box systems are there?\u00a0 What's the scale like?</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We don't know.\u00a0 Like full stop, it's a fundamental challenge to accountability.\u00a0 We don't have an accounting for where these are being used or what they are.\u00a0 Is this an overburdened spreadsheet or is this a neural net being applied to determining somebody Medicaid disbursements, right?\u00a0 So where we do see problems and we see them frequently from policing heat maps to the case I'm referring to in Idaho where Medicaid disbursements dropped by 30% and people didn't know why because they didn't know how the system worked.</p><p>A number of these cases crop up.\u00a0 These are kind of the tips of the iceberg.\u00a0 This is where investigative journalists or researchers are able to get access, are able to get information where a whistleblower, say, comes forward and talks about these systems breaking down in a specific way.\u00a0 But we're in a situation where these are making determinations about people's access and opportunity.\u00a0 Oftentimes, or most times, I would say, without the individuals who are affected, even knowing that the system had a rule.\u00a0 So auditing and accountability are core issues that we need to first build the social framework to accommodate.\u00a0 I would say before we continue rolling these systems into core decision-making.</p><p>AI Now just published an algorithmic impact assessment framework for the New York City algorithmic accountability bill task force kind of beginning to put some structure around these ideas and suggest ways of starting to audit and assess and account for these systems.</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So the University of Southern California Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society is something I co-founded with Professor Eric Rice.\u00a0 This is a collaboration between AI researchers and social work.\u00a0 We're very proud of this sort of collaboration that's interdisciplinary.\u00a0 But really, with social workers who are out there in the field.\u00a0 And so the kind of grand vision is AI to address sort of grand challenges of the American Academy of Social Work and Social Welfare, mainly homelessness, achieving equal opportunity and justice, and so forth.\u00a0 There are 12 grand challenges or grand challenges of the National Academy of Engineering.</p><p>So within those, I guess our focus has been on concrete problems where we can really assist and make a difference in working with low-resource populations, such as with homeless youth or in conservation, trying to protect engendered wildlife or in public safety and security.\u00a0 And so we are focused on augmenting human decision-making.\u00a0 So things that are already being done by humans in these organizations, but for a system of a software decision age.\u00a0 So that's the focus of the work that we've been doing.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It sounds like this is a very impact-focused kind of artificial intelligence.\u00a0 Do you feel like the field at large has focused on impact, even whether it's business goals or social good or do we run the risk of AI as really working towards novelty, trying to solve an interesting, but not useful problem?</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So this is a question that's very near and dear to my heart.\u00a0 Speaking to the research community, I feel that in AI, we need to focus more on impact.\u00a0 And it's because when we publish and so forth, novelty is given a higher weight.\u00a0 And the impact is not and so as a result-but it's up to us as researchers, as senior researchers in AI to redefine what are important ways to measure progress for younger researchers.\u00a0 Because if the reward system is such that what counts as novelty and not impact, then essentially, that's where people will go.\u00a0 But impact and if you want to see the societally beneficial impact, then that's something that we as researchers need to define as an evaluation criterion so that people speak to that and do research in that area.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'd just like to jump in on this quick.\u00a0 You have a tangible example.\u00a0 So along with OpenAI, I also do a project called the AI Index, which is about tracking progress in AI.\u00a0 And what you discover there is there's this premium placed on novelty.\u00a0 If it means that we think AI is progressing in some way faster than it is.\u00a0 And I'll give you a kind of specific example.\u00a0 Last November, Alibaba and Microsoft claimed they had reached human performance on question answering, on Stanford's data set called SQuAD.\u00a0 You don't need to know too much about it other than the fact that they issued press releases saying they'd reached a human level and machines could now understand power graphs of text as well as a human.\u00a0 Everyone got very excited and thought, \"Well, I guess that's done now.\u00a0 We can move onto other stuff.\"\u00a0 And the Allen AI Institute, which is from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, just released a new data set called \"ARC,\" which also tests common sense reasoning over natural language.</p><p>And every single existing technique, including the ones that do well on SQuAD, totally failed to do anything interesting on ARC.\u00a0 And their performance is maybe they get it right 25% of the time.\u00a0 So that's subhuman.\u00a0 Human level is meant to be 90%.\u00a0 And so I think that by prioritizing like the new, new thing, you risk making us think that A, AI is progressing faster than it is, and B, it sort of subverts the effect of doing useful stuff that actually works in the real world.\u00a0 And I think it's important, especially for you in your position here at The Washington Post to always be pushing companies to say, \"But what does it actually do that's useful?\"</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I guess we are not saying that novelty has no value.\u00a0 Obviously, it should complement or add additional weight on social impact so there's more balance and not just sort of pure novelty.\u00a0 And there is research going on, but I feel not enough and we could do more to encourage that.</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Just a quick addition there.\u00a0 I would agree with both Milind and Jack around sort of novelty driving, a kind of warped understanding of AI progress.\u00a0 I do maybe want to take it back to this term \"impact\" and pick that apart a little bit because I actually see the recent AI boom being a recognition that you could impact bottom lines by commercializing this technology, right?\u00a0 And there's a lot of people who have been working since around 2012 that sort of an increasing exponential ark to figure out how do we market AI products?</p><p>So when I talk about black boxes deployed in core government agencies, the chain of title there is often to vendors who are selling extreme promises based on the capabilities of systems that probably haven't been tested in the populations they're going to impact.\u00a0 So there's an issue here, I think, not with AI as having no impact, but with the impact as being measured by bottom lines in sleek tech conference rooms.\u00a0 And actually, there's kind of an air gap between that and the environments that are actually being significantly shaped by the determinations of these systems at scale.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So how do we close that gap?\u00a0 How do we get from saying there are specific researchers or engineers who are designing these algorithms that they are then either placing in a black box or maybe in some cases, exposing-to having a voice from the people who are being impacted by those algorithms?\u00a0 What's the way that we close that?</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So at least for us, one major way of trying to do this is through emersion.\u00a0 So our students or myself or others, we actually want to go to the location where the impact is to be measured and work with the people there.\u00a0 It's problem-centered.\u00a0 It's coming from the domain.\u00a0 And so when it comes to conservation, we've actually patrolled in forests in Malaysia, and so forth, to really understand what is really the problem or go to the forests in Uganda.\u00a0 With working with the homeless shelters in Los Angeles.\u00a0 So be there, we are working with social workers.\u00a0 It's fundamentally interdisciplinary.\u00a0 It just can't be AI researchers figuring this all out by ourselves.\u00a0 And I always try to think about showing humilities of working with public safety or security, working with the Coast Guard, for example.\u00a0 That we can't be sitting in LA at USC and say, \"We know better how to drive your boats, so we are going to tell you.\"</p><p>We really need to go beyond the boats in New York and understand how they work and so we can devil up algorithms that are more appropriate to the location.\u00a0 And are done in an interdisciplinary fashion, are responsive to the needs of those who are using it, and so on.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Is there also a question of-you touched on Meredith, transparency, but also regulation.\u00a0 So who gets to say whether these-the algorithms being used, the automated approach being selected is fair, and fair to whom?</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, this is the multitrillion-dollar question.\u00a0 I think we do need shared standards across the industry.\u00a0 I think regulation could absolutely be helpful in some of these cases.\u00a0 I think we need to have sort of a clear-eyed understanding that we need to validate before we try in high-stakes domains.\u00a0 Now, we're in a situation where the acceleration of commercialized tech has had resources behind it for a couple of decades.\u00a0 We are not in the same situation where the research field that is looking at the nuances of measuring lived-impact across dynamic contextual domains has had the same amount of acceleration.\u00a0 So there's a real need to center fundamental research on these questions.</p><p>I think transparency, I would say, is part of the equation.\u00a0 We need to know where these are.\u00a0 We need to know the justifications for their use.\u00a0 We need to know by which standards they were audited, and we need to have clear democratic processes to either accept or reject that use over time.\u00a0 And that's part of what we proposed in the Algorithmic Impact Assessment framework, which is being led by our law and policy research team.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And this is an area where I think the government has a clear role to play.\u00a0 Earlier today we heard from the senators and we regularly hear from policymakers about how they want to do something about AI.\u00a0 I think measuring and evaluating and assessing how AI is deployed is what government really should be in the business of doing.\u00a0 I would like the government to tell me that it has tested all of the autonomous cars on the road and could give me reports on their performance.\u00a0 And that's not based on the tragic accident that happened yesterday.\u00a0 This is a long-term problem.\u00a0 Like if I want to understand self-driving car progression today, I need to go and look at the reports filed with the California DMV, which tell me the number of disengagements for each autonomous vehicle makes per vendor.\u00a0 And then I need to build my own spreadsheets and then I get a view of performance in that state.</p><p>All of the companies have since moved their testing out of California because they don't like me being able to find this out.\u00a0 So actually now, it's spread around the country and no one knows.\u00a0 And this is terrible.\u00a0 This is like a technology that is going to dramatically affect our economy, affect people's lives, and influence safety.\u00a0 And beyond assessing the rate of progression in it because the private sector is saying, \"Well, that's too commercially sensitive.\u00a0 You can't really do that.\"\u00a0 Which is observed.\u00a0 So I think that having the government take more of a role here would be beneficial and it would also force information into a domain-of a public domain, which isn't.\u00a0 Like as Meredith said earlier, if I want to find out about where government is using AI today, I need to do like Freedom of Information Act requests or I need to work with the ACLU, or I need to call up people I know in government and go and have a beer and ask them about what machine learning system broke today.</p><p>None of that feels particularly healthy, so yeah, I think is a pretty serious issue.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Well, and the question of, for example, different states having different standards is particularly interesting, but AI has been applied internationally.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mm-hmm.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 On what level are we talking about?\u00a0 Are we talking about a municipal level, a state level, a federal level or an international level?\u00a0 Do we need international standards?</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 All of them.</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'll offer a quick comment and then turn it over.\u00a0 I think we're oftentimes talking about massive global systems at a huge scale.\u00a0 So as we've seen with GDPR, as we've seen with other regulations, the high watermark for regulatory intervention matters because you're not going to be bespoke that system a number of times.\u00a0 So I think all of them make sense because context varies.\u00a0 Norms vary, et cetera.\u00a0 But we should attend to the power of smart regulatory intervention.</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I agree on all that was said earlier with respect to government help in regulation and so forth.\u00a0 But in addition to that, as we discussed earlier, it's also within the research community.\u00a0 This is now sort of evolving into more an interdisciplinary science and therefore, the need for us as researchers to-in AI to reach out to people in other disciplines and really force ourselves, to encourage ourselves to do these kinds of measurements and I'm in full support of what Meredith was saying earlier with respect to really doing a better job of measuring things in the field and really measuring the impact and assessment.\u00a0 But these sorts of things today are difficult because if I'm a researcher publishing these sorts of things, getting encouragement from the impact and so forth is a little bit harder.\u00a0 So there is a role for government, but there's also a role for AI researchers to do something about this.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So specifically for the AI Index, which does this measurement initiative, we were trying to find a new person recently who can join the kind of core team, which includes myself that works on it.\u00a0 And we were talking to a really smart young pre-tenure track professor or about-to-be professor.\u00a0 And we were saying, \"Do you want to join the index?\u00a0 It's a chance to do something where you have some impact and it's a chance to like set norms.\"\u00a0 And they said, \"No, because I am pre-tenure.\u00a0 So this would not be evaluated positively.\u00a0 I need to be doing technical contributions.\"\u00a0 And that is kind of frightening to me.\u00a0 The incentives are set up in such a way that academics who want to work on impact find it challenging to.</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 We have a little trope we throw around AI Now to explain why we are so constitutively interdisciplinary across six faculty at NYU.\u00a0 And it goes a little something like, \"You wouldn't expect a doctor to tune a deep neural net; you shouldn't expect a computer scientist to make complex decisions in fields like medicine, et cetera.\"\u00a0 So we're really looking at this sort of expert drift, where in the computer science field, which sort of dominates the big tech industry that is driving a lot of this innovation has sort of taken it upon itself and I think many people are deeply uncomfortable with this, within and outside of these companies to make really significant decisions that affect domains that are outside their realm of expertise.</p><p>So I think we need to look at a fundamental restructuring of what we call \"product development,\" of what we call \"research,\" of how we define AI research to include sociologists, ethnographers, legal scholars, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How are those decisions getting made?\u00a0 Are the computer scientists identifying problems they want to solve outside of their own disciplines?\u00a0 Are people coming to them?\u00a0 How do you make that a more inclusive process?</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I think what should happen, and to some extent, we strive to make it happen in our center is to-as I saw saying earlier, user-centered problem-solving.\u00a0 So you start from the problem.\u00a0 and for some people, it's kind of confusing; why do you start from a problem?\u00a0 Why not start from a solution?\u00a0 Which is not necessarily the best approach.\u00a0 So I can give you kind of this concrete example, where we were trying to come up with better patrolling methods for protecting endangered wildlife in Malaysia, for example.\u00a0 And we could sit in LA and come up with, \"Oh, this is the best patrolling route.\"\u00a0 And the people that we were talking to on Skype were saying, \"No, no, this doesn't work.\u00a0 This absolutely doesn't work.\"\u00a0 The shortest distance between two points is not a straight line.</p><p>And to us, it was like, \"How can that be?\"\u00a0 So we flew down to Malaysia.\u00a0 We actually patrolled in the forest and suddenly realized, \"Yeah, you have to walk along ridge lines, you have to walk along river beds.\u00a0 You can't just walk in a straight line in a forest to patrol.\u00a0 It doesn't make sense.\"\u00a0 These are the types of things that can only be gained by being on the spot in real-life rather than just sitting in the lab and saying, \"This is it.\"\u00a0 Now, I want to be sure.\u00a0 There's a lot of wonderful theoretic work researchers are doing.\u00a0 This must continue.\u00a0 Pure, basic AI research has to continue.\u00a0 But there's space for this additional kind of work.\u00a0 And this requires us to get out of the lab and get out in the field.\u00a0 And rather than focusing on what is really available as a data set, like ad auctions and so forth.\u00a0 To focus on new kinds of problems where data sets are not necessarily easily available; where it is harder to do that kind of work.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And some of it is about changing norms so that researchers think that they should intentionally be multi-disciplinary.\u00a0 At least for some projects.\u00a0 We did a project recently on malicious actors in AI.\u00a0 So how you expect really unpleasant people to take open-source AI technology and do unpleasant things with it.\u00a0 And so to do that, we ended up posting a workshop about a year ago in the UK and we had people from the police come along, people from intelligence agencies, people from the AI research community, sort of black hat hackers, who had, in a past life, been one of these nasty people using open-source technology to do unpleasant things, but it was very helpful because then you're there with people with a huge spread of skills outside of this, like narrow technical domain, who can tell you, \"No, this is like the real problem or this should be your real threat model.\"</p><p>And I think the more we can do with that, the better, and AI Now has been sort of leading some of these initiatives already.</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I would agree.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] I've been in the tech industry for over 11 years now, so I'm what they call a veteran.\u00a0 And I think we really need to examine the culture of tech because I will testify from my own experience, it feels like it's gotten less diverse and more homogeneous as its sort of power has ascended.\u00a0 And I think as Jack was saying, you can have the best intentions, but if you're in the room with people who fit a very homogeneous demographic who have shared the same experiences, whose problems involve the laundry delivery maybe didn't come on time that day.\u00a0 You shouldn't be expected to have these sort infinite, imaginative capacity to put yourself in the position of everyone who your technology is going to influence.\u00a0 So we urgently need to diversify the voices that are informing the development of these technologies, and I think to figure out how we do that with clear incentives, and with sort of respect for the people whose voices and kind of time we're asking for because the kind of open-source model of like, \"Let the community to do,\" is asking for a labor that is often not compensated.\u00a0 So I think this is something we need to conscientiously and very clearly kind of set up structurally so that it works and isn't an unfunded mandate on the most marginalized populations.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I mean, is this essentially a part of the challenges if the people you put in the room are codifying their own biases into the algorithms that they create, you're going to A, get back the results that they probably expect.\u00a0 But B, probably not recognize all of the problems.\u00a0 Inclusion is certainly one technique.\u00a0 Is there an issue of awareness as well?</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, yes.\u00a0 And there are many other issues, right?\u00a0 We're talking about one issue that is sort of problematic.\u00a0 There's an issue with not examining the data sets you use, right?\u00a0 Are you using data collected by the Baltimore Police Departments gun-tracking task force, which is not under investigation for criminal conspiracy, planting drugs on suspects?\u00a0 This is one of the largest kind of police misconduct cases in the country.\u00a0 Are we then deploying predictive policing that would use that data as ground truth to determine who looks like a criminal or not, right?\u00a0 There is a lot more investigation we need to do on what are the fundamental claims being made in the data?\u00a0 What is the history, who builds the classifiers and the algorithm, what is the viewpoint that is imparted there?\u00a0 Then what is the context in which this would use, and what are the sort of power asymmetries and other issues that might attend sort of a cop getting a score on a tablet and then applying that to policing work, for one example.</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I guess in our work, the focus is more on augmenting humans for making decisions in very complicated situations.\u00a0 So if you're trying to spread information about HIV prevention, which is one of the problems we are working on.\u00a0 Who are the right youth to select in a homeless shelter to spread that information?\u00a0 This is a task where you're looking at the social network, trying to figure out all the right people.\u00a0 These kinds of tasks are already being done by human beings.\u00a0 They're augmenting their capabilities.\u00a0 But we want to achieve the right kind of balance, not all were prescribed.\u00a0 So the right level of autonomy.</p><p>If we are trying to tell rangers in Uganda that this is where you're going to find snares.\u00a0 You can give them a certain area, say 500 meters by 500-meter areas, this is where you're going to find it.\u00a0 We don't have the ability to tell them, \"Well, you're going to find it under this tree.\"\u00a0 They are experts in that domain and we should harness their expertise where possible and leave AI to do what it knows best.\u00a0 And understanding this right level of balance between the teamwork between humans and AI is also an important aspect of research as we go forward.</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And I think this is from sort of what we've been talking about the narrowness of AI communities sometimes.\u00a0 I frequently have conversations with perfectly nice people who are talking about an AI research project and they were like, \"We must remove the human from this entire process.\"\u00a0 Yeah, well, that's dubious and I think it's because we aren't developing enough respect for the fact that people are incredibly smart and incredibly good at doing lots of things.\u00a0 And the temptation within AI is to automate the entire process.\u00a0 Whereas, you're probably going to have something much smarter in aggregate if you find a way to have the person use their skills and just remove some of the dull or tedious work.\u00a0 And 90% of the time, that seems to be the better course of action.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So the last question I would pose to you, and I think you were very much hinting at it here is if there is fear in the community, and you wrote about this recently.\u00a0 And by community, I mean outside of the AI community, honestly.\u00a0 It's at this sort of replacement of humans for specific tasks.\u00a0 How do you balance the fact that work and a sense of purpose is really important for lots of people against the idea that there are lots of rote tasks and things that can be done to either augment or to avoid certain actions?\u00a0 Where's the balance?</p><p>Whittaker:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I would start historically and just mention that before the mid-nineteenth century and the Industrial Revolution, we really didn't have the same structure of work that we have now in the West.\u00a0 So the nuclear family with somebody who went out to do wage work at a factory and came back and the household as this sort of separate realm was not the norm, right?\u00a0 You had family economies.\u00a0 People participated in productive labor.\u00a0 There was a blending between life and work and these distinctions didn't apply.\u00a0 So that's one example we have across cultures and histories, many, many, many different examples of what meaningful productivity and interaction looks like for human beings.\u00a0 So I might push back a little bit against the truism that without a timesheet to clock in with, we will be adrift with no meaning.\u00a0 And I would also then offer that we're a ways from total replacement.\u00a0 I think in keeping with the spirit of AI now, we should look at what's already happening.\u00a0 We have AI-driven hiring.\u00a0 We have AI-driven management.\u00a0 We have precarity economies like Uber and other things that effectively run large machine-learning systems to instrument their labor.\u00a0 So what are the impacts of these small encroachments?\u00a0 What are the power asymmetries that are emphasized there, and how do we draw on what we know today to understand possible trajectories and not sort of look for this bright line between humans with work and humans adrift without meaning?</p><p>Clark:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I just want to pile onto what Meredith said quickly, in two kind of specific points.\u00a0 One is that, yeah, we need to broaden our definition of work.\u00a0 Like emotional labor is a significant amount of work but is broadly kind of uncompensated across society.\u00a0 We have like an aging population who need good social relationships.\u00a0 Maybe I'm strange, but I would like to go and get the chance to go and talk to people and have that be seen as my work, just along with my work at OpenAI.\u00a0 There's lots of jobs that people would like to be paid for, but we just choose not to compensate as a society currently.</p><p>And the second point is-and I think Meredith touched on this.\u00a0 That where AI gets deployed into sort of middle-class or lower-class jobs, there's not much evidence that it makes those jobs more pleasant.\u00a0 It actually seems like it makes those jobs unpleasant.\u00a0 And I think that we should remember that because it's very easy to go to these conferences and think like, \"AI is making tremendous strides in productivity.\"\u00a0 But it's usually doing that at the cost of a sense of human agency.\u00a0 And I think that we can be really complacent to the tech industry about this, but eventually, that's going to like come home.\u00a0 And the previous ways this came home were like the Luddites, which was a reaction to the Industrial Revolution being mostly terrible during the time it occurred.\u00a0 And also the French Revolution, which was like fairly unpleasant for the people that are being complacent about things.\u00a0 So let's not kind of sit on our laurels and say everything is fine.</p><p>Tambe:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 So I want to agree with a lot of what's said, but I also want to say that there's a lot of immediate benefits that we can accrue from AI by deploying them in low-resource communities for domains like suicide prevention or substance abuse prevention or the kind of domains that are important for low-resource communities, for conservation, for public safety.\u00a0 And these are things we can do today, and we should not lose sight of the benefits that AI is providing there already.\u00a0 And not get so fearful that we will stop that kind of work.\u00a0 So that is important for us to continue forward.</p><p>Gilbert:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much.\u00a0 Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for today.\u00a0 I'd really like to thank Jack Clark, Meredith Whittaker, and Milind Tambe for joining us.\u00a0 If you'd like to watch video clips from any of today's discussions or past Washington Post Live programs, please head over to Washingtonpostlive.com.\u00a0 I'm Jeremy Gilbert and thank you so much for watching

Medical science has improved rapidly, raising life expectancy around the world, but as longevity increases, healthcare systems face growing demand for their services, rising costs and a workforce that is struggling to meet the needs of its patients.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Demand is driven by a combination of unstoppable forces: population aging, changing patient expectations, a shift in lifestyle choices, and the never-ending cycle of innovation being but a few. Of these, the implications from an aging population stand out. By 2050, one in four people in Europe and North America will be over the age of 65-this means the health systems will have to deal with more patients with complex needs. Managing such patients is expensive and requires systems to shift from an episodic care-based philosophy to one that is much more proactive and focused on long-term care management.</p><p>Healthcare spending is simply not keeping up. Without major structural and transformational change, healthcare systems will struggle to remain sustainable. Health systems also need a larger workforce, but although the global economy could create 40 million new health-sector jobs by 2030, there is still a projected shortfall of 9.9 million physicians, nurses and midwives globally over the same period, according to the World Health Organization. We need not only to attract, train and retain more healthcare professionals, but we also need to ensure their time is used where it adds most value-caring for patients.</p><p>Building on automation, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionise healthcare and help address some of the challenges set out above. There are several definitions of AI, but this report draws from a concise and helpful definition used by the European Parliament, \"AI is the capability of a computer program to perform tasks or reasoning processes that we usually associate with intelligence in a human being.\" AI can lead to better care outcomes and improve the productivity and efficiency of care delivery. It can also improve the day-to-day life of healthcare practitioners, letting them spend more time looking after patients and in so doing, raise staff morale and improve retention. It can even get life-saving treatments to market faster. At the same time, questions have been raised about the impact AI could have on patients, practitioners and health systems, and about its potential risks; there are ethical debates around how AI and the data that underpins it should be used.</p><p>This EIT Health and McKinsey &amp; Company report aims to contribute to the debate surrounding AI in healthcare, specifically looking at how practitioners and organizations will be affected. It aims to cast light on the priorities and trade-offs for different parts of the healthcare system in Europe and beyond. The report draws on proprietary research and analyses undertaken by EIT Health and McKinsey &amp; Company. This includes work by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) on the future of work in the era of automation and AI, analysing the impact on healthcare practitioners in Europe; a series of one-to-one interviews with 62 healthcare and other leaders with experience in AI and digital health, and an online survey of 175 healthcare professionals, healthcare investors and AI startup founders and other executives. AI in healthcare being a fast-moving field, the report provides a unique vantage point from the frontline of healthcare delivery and innovation today and the latest view from a wide array of stakeholders on AI's potential, the real state of play today, and what is holding us back.</p><p>Last, to highlight where AI is already having an impact in healthcare, the report also looks at detailed examples of existing AI solutions in six core areas where AI has a direct impact on the patient and three areas of the healthcare value chain that could benefit from further scaling of AI (Exhibit 1).</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Healthcare Systems and Services/Our Insights/Transforming healthcare with AI/PNG-AI-in-healthcare-ex1.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>In doing so, the report provides a unique contribution to the debate on the impact of AI in healthcare in four ways: 1) decision makers' view of the state-of-play in this fast-moving field, where developments from just 12 months ago are considered \"old news\"; 2) a robust new methodology to evaluate the impact of automation and AI on specific skills and activities in healthcare in Europe; 3) a substantial review of use cases that illustrate the potential that AI is already on track to deliver; 4) a unique view from the frontline, hearing from healthcare professionals, investors and startup executives on where the real potential, opportunities and barriers lie.</p><p>The report does not attempt to cover all facets of this complex issue, in particular the ethics of AI or managing AI-related risks, but does reflect the efforts on this important topic led by EIT Health and other EU institutions. Equally, while it acknowledges the potential disruptive impact of personalisation on both healthcare delivery and healthcare innovation in the future (e.g., in R&amp;D), the report focuses primarily on the impact of AI on healthcare professionals and organizations, based on the use cases available today.</p><p>Last, AI is in its infancy and its long-term implications are uncertain. Future applications of AI in healthcare delivery, in the approach to innovation and in how each of us thinks about our health, may be transformative. We can imagine a future in which population-level data from wearables and implants change our understanding of human biology and of how medicines work, enabling personalised and real-time treatment for all. This report focuses on what is real today and what will enable innovation and adoption tomorrow, rather than exploring the long-term future of personalised medicine. Faced with the uncertainty of the eventual scope of application of emerging technologies, some short-term opportunities are clear, as are steps that will enable health providers and systems to bring benefits from innovation in AI to the populations they serve more rapidly.</p><h>AI in healthcare today</h><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More data, better data, more connected data</emphasis></h><p>What do we mean by AI in healthcare? In this report we include applications that affect care delivery, including both how existing tasks are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">performed</emphasis> and how they are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">disrupted</emphasis> by changing healthcare needs or the processes required to address them. We also include applications that enhance and improve healthcare delivery, from day-to-day operational improvement in healthcare organizations to population-health management and the world of healthcare innovation. It's a broad definition that covers natural language processing (NLP), image analysis and predictive analytics based on machine learning. As such, it illustrates a spectrum of AI solutions, where encoding clinical guidelines or existing clinical protocols through a rules-based system often provides a starting point, which then can be <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">augmented</emphasis> by models that learn from data.</p><p>AI is now top-of-mind for healthcare decision makers, governments, investors and innovators, and the EU itself. An increasing number of governments have set out aspirations for AI in healthcare, in countries as diverse as Finland, Germany, the UK, Israel, China, and the United States and many are investing heavily in AI-related research. The private sector continues to play a significant role, with venture capital (VC) funding for the top 50 firms in healthcare-related AI reaching $8.5 billion, and big tech firms, startups, pharmaceutical and medical-devices firms and health insurers, all engaging with the nascent AI healthcare ecosystem.</p><p>Geographically, the dynamics of AI growth are shifting. The US still dominates the list of firms with highest VC funding in healthcare AI to date, and has the most completed AI-related healthcare research studies and trials. But the fastest growth is emerging in Asia, especially China, where leading domestic conglomerates and tech players have consumer-focused healthcare AI offerings and Ping An's Good Doctor, the leading online health-management platform already lists more than 300 million users. Europe, meanwhile, benefits from the vast troves of health data collected in national health systems and has significant strengths in terms of the number of research studies, established clusters of innovation and pan-European collaborations, a pan-European approach to core aspects of AI (e.g., ethics, privacy, \"trustworthy AI\") and an emerging strategy on how to ensure the \"EU way\" for AI helps deliver the advantages for AI to its population. Yet, at the same time, valuable data sets are not linked, with critical data-governance, access and security issues still needing to be clarified, delaying further adoption. European investment and research in AI are strong when grouped together but fragmented at the country or regional level. Overall, there is a significant opportunity for EU health systems, but AI's full potential remains to be explored and the impact on the ground remains limited. A surprising 44 percent of the healthcare professionals we surveyed-and these were professionals chosen based on their engagement with healthcare innovation-had never been involved in the development or deployment of an AI solution in their organisation.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Growing number of use cases</emphasis></h><p>While there are widespread questions on what is real in AI in healthcare today, this report looked at 23 applications in use today and provides case studies of 14 applications already in use. These illustrate the full range of areas where AI can have impact: from apps that help patients manage their care themselves, to online symptom checkers and e-triage AI tools, to virtual agents that can carry out tasks in hospitals, to a bionic pancreas to help patients with diabetes. Some help improve healthcare operations by optimising scheduling or bed management, others improve population health by predicting the risk of hospital admission or helping detect specific cancers early enabling intervention that can lead to better survival rates; and others even help optimise healthcare R&amp;D and pharmacovigilance. The scale of many solutions remains small, but their increasing adoption at the health-system level indicates the pace of change is accelerating. In most cases, the question is less whether AI can have impact, and more how to increase the potential for impact and, crucially, how to do so while improving the user experience and increasing user adoption.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three phases of scaling AI in healthcare</emphasis></h><p>We are in the very early days of our understanding of AI and its full potential in healthcare, in particular with regards to the impact of AI on personalisation. Nevertheless, interviewees and survey respondents conclude that over time we could expect to see three phases of scaling AI in healthcare, looking at solutions already available and the pipeline of ideas.</p><p>First, solutions are likely to address the low-hanging fruit of routine, repetitive and largely administrative tasks, which absorb significant time of doctors and nurses, optimising healthcare operations and increasing adoption. In this first phase, we would also include AI applications based on imaging, which are already in use in specialties such as radiology, pathology and ophthalmology.</p><p>In the second phase, we expect more AI solutions that support the shift from hospital-based to home-based care, such as remote monitoring, AI-powered alerting systems or virtual assistants, as patients take increasing ownership of their care. This phase could also include a broader use of NLP solutions in the hospital and home setting, and more use of AI in a broader number of specialties, such as oncology, cardiology or neurology, where advances are already being made. This will require AI to be embedded more extensively in clinical workflows, through the intensive engagement of professional bodies and providers. It will also require well designed and integrated solutions to use existing technologies effectively in new contexts. This scaling up of AI deployment would be fuelled by a combination of technological advancements (e.g., in deep learning, NLP, connectivity etc.) and cultural change and capability building within organizations.</p><p>In the third phase, we would expect to see more AI solutions in clinical practice based on evidence from clinical trials, with increasing focus on improved and scaled clinical decision-support (CDS) tools in a sector that has learned lessons from earlier attempts to introduce such tools into clinical practice and has adapted its mind-set, culture and skills. Ultimately respondents would expect to see AI as an integral part of the healthcare value chain, from how we learn, to how we investigate and deliver care, to how we improve the health of populations. Important preconditions for AI to deliver its full potential in European healthcare will be the integration of broader data sets across organizations, strong governance to continuously improve data quality, and greater confidence from organizations, practitioners and patients in both the AI solutions and the ability to manage the related risks.</p><h>How will AI change the healthcare workforce?</h><p>The MGI has studied how automation and AI are likely to affect the future of work. It concludes that automation will affect most jobs across sectors, but the degree varies significantly, and healthcare is one of the sectors with the lowest overall potential for automation-only 35 percent of time spent is potentially automatable and this varies by type of occupation. The potential for automation is different to the likelihood of adoption.</p><p>The analysis uses a midpoint scenario, which estimates that 15 percent of current work hours in healthcare are expected to be automated. Exhibit 2 shows the share of hours currently worked that could be freed up by automation by 2030 for a wide range of healthcare occupations in selected European countries. This does not reflect the potential for further disruption through other factors, such as personalisation, that may revolutionise healthcare by focusing on a \"segment of one\".</p><h>Exhibit</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Industries/Healthcare Systems and Services/Our Insights/Transforming healthcare with AI/PNG-AI-in-healthcare-ex2.ashx\"> Link to Image </url></p><p>How will automation and AI affect the number of jobs in healthcare? The reality is that the European healthcare sector faces a significant workforce gap that is only expected to widen. The World Health Organization estimates overall demand for healthcare workers to rise to 18.2 million across Europe by 2030 and, as an example, states that the current supply of 8.6 million nurses, midwives and healthcare assistants across Europe will not meet current or projected future need. The MGI analysis of the demand for specific types of healthcare activities suggests significant increases in the need for specific professionals, such as licenced practical and vocational nurses, home health aides and others, who are core to the day-to-day delivery of care to European citizens. It highlights that automation could, in fact, alleviate workforce shortages in healthcare, as demand for occupations is set to increase. For example, a 39 percent increase in all nursing occupations is expected by 2030, even allowing for the fact that approximately 10 percent of nursing activities could be freed up by automation.</p><p>The impact on the workforce will be much more than jobs lost or gained-the work itself will change. At the heart of any change is the opportunity to refocus on and improve patient care. AI can help remove or minimise time spent on routine, administrative tasks, which can take up to 70 percent of a healthcare practitioner's time. A recurring theme in interviews was that this type of AI role would not just be uncontroversial but would top of most people's wish list and would speed up adoption. AI can go further. It can augment a range of clinical activities and help healthcare practitioners access information that can lead to better patient outcomes and higher quality of care. It can improve the speed and accuracy in use of diagnostics, give practitioners faster and easier access to more knowledge, and enable remote monitoring and patient empowerment through self-care. This will all require bringing new activities and skills into the sector, and it will change healthcare education-shifting the focus away from memorising facts and moving to innovation, entrepreneurship, continuous learning and multidisciplinary working. The biggest leap of all will be the need to embed digital and AI skills within healthcare organizations-not only for physicians to change the nature of consultations, but for all frontline staff to integrate AI into their workflow. This is a significant change in organisational culture and capabilities, and one that will necessitate parallel action from practitioners, organizations and systems all working together.</p><p>The final effect on the workforce will be the introduction of new professionals. Multiple roles will emerge at the intersection of medical and data-science expertise. For example, medical leaders will have to shape clinically meaningful and explainable AI that contains the insights and information to support decisions and deepen healthcare professionals' understanding of their patients. Clinical engagement will also be required in product leadership, in order to determine the contribution of AI-based decision-support systems within broader clinical protocols. Designers specialising in human-machine interactions on clinical decision making will help create new workflows that integrate AI. Data architects will be critical in defining how to record, store and structure clinical data so that algorithms can deliver insights, while leaders in data governance and data ethics will also play vital roles. In other data-rich areas, such as genomics, new professionals would include 'hybrid' roles, such as clinical bioinformaticians, specialists in genomic medicine and genomic counsellors. Institutions will have to develop teams with expertise in partnering with, procuring and implementing AI products that have been developed or pioneered by other institutions. Orchestrating the introduction of new specialisations coming from data science and engineering within healthcare delivery will become a critical skill in itself. There will be an urgent need for health systems to attract and retain such scarce and valuable talent, for example, by developing flexible and exciting career paths and clear routes to leadership roles.</p><h>What needs to change to encourage the introduction and scaling of AI in healthcare?</h><p>The strides made in the field of AI in healthcare have been momentous. Moving to a world in which AI can deliver significant, consistent and global improvements in care will be more challenging.</p><p>Of course, AI is not a panacea for healthcare systems, and it comes with strings attached. The analyses in this report and the latest views from stakeholders and frontline staff reveal a set of themes that all players in the healthcare ecosystem will need to address:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working together to deliver quality AI in healthcare.</emphasis> Quality came up in our interviews time and again, especially issues around the poor choice of use cases, AI design and ease of use, the quality and performance of algorithms, and the robustness and completeness of underlying data. The lack of multidisciplinary development and early involvement of healthcare staff, and limited iteration by joint AI and healthcare teams were cited as major barriers to addressing quality issues early on and adopting solutions at scale. The survey revealed this is driven by both sides: only 14 percent of startup executives felt that the input of healthcare professionals was critical in the early design phase; while the healthcare professionals saw the private sector's role in areas such as aggregating or analysing data, providing a secure space for data lakes, or helping upskill healthcare staff as minimal or nonexistent. One problem AI solutions face is building the clinical evidence of quality and effectiveness. While startups are interested in scaling solutions fast, healthcare practitioners must have proof that any new idea will \"do no harm\" before it comes anywhere near a patient. Practitioners also want to understand how it works, where the underlying data come from and what biases might be embedded in the algorithms, so are interested in going past the concept of AI as a \"black box\" to understand what underpins it. Transparency and collaboration between innovators and practitioners will be key in scaling AI in European healthcare. User-centric design is another essential component of a quality product. Design should have the end user at its heart. This means AI should fit seamlessly with the workflow of decision makers and by being used, it will be improved. Many interviewees agreed that if AI design delivers value to end users, those users are more likely to pay attention to the quality of data they contribute, thereby improving the AI and creating a virtuous circle. Finally, AI research needs to heavily emphasise explainable, causal and ethical AI, which could be a key driver of adoption.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rethinking education and skills.</emphasis> We have already touched on the importance of digital skills-these are not part of most practitioners' arsenal today. AI in healthcare will require leaders well-versed in both biomedical and data science. There have been recent moves to train students in the science where medicine, biology and informatics meet through joint degrees, though this is less prevalent in Europe. More broadly, skills such as basic digital literacy, the fundamentals of genomics, AI and machine learning need to become mainstream for all practitioners, supplemented by critical-thinking skills and the development of a continuous-learning mind-set. Alongside upgrading clinical training, healthcare systems need to think about the existing workforce and provide ongoing learning, while practitioners need the time and incentive to continue learning.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strengthening data quality, governance, security and interoperability.</emphasis> Both interviewees and survey respondents emphasised that data access, quality and availability were potential roadblocks. The data challenge breaks down into digitising health to generate the data, collecting the data, and setting up the governance around data management. MGI analyses show that healthcare is among the least digitised sectors in Europe, lagging behind in digital business processes, digital spend per worker, digital capital deepening and the digitisation of work and processes. It is critical to get the basic digitisation of systems and data in place before embarking on AI deployments-not least because the frustrations staff have with basic digitisation could spill over to the wider introduction of AI. In addition, as more healthcare is delivered using new digital technologies, public concerns about how healthcare data are used have grown. Healthcare organizations should have robust and compliant data-sharing policies that support the improvements in care that AI offers while providing the right safeguards in a cost-efficient way. Physicians we interviewed emphasised that, given the volume of data required for AI, a poorly thought out process of anonymisation could be a major cost, making diagnostic algorithms prohibitively expensive. Interviewees also emphasised, however, that both healthcare as a sector and Europe as a region have significant advantages. First, both healthcare organizations and health systems are used to dealing with sensitive data through well-structured data governance and risk-management processes. In some cases, healthcare could lead the way for other sectors seeking to put such measures in place. Secondly, Europe benefits from national health systems with extensive data sets, often shared within integrated care systems, offering a set of systems and processes to build on that could also serve as examples to other regions. The final data challenge is getting data sets to talk to each other. Policy makers, funding bodies and nonprofit organizations need to support efforts to sufficiently anonymise and link data and, where sensible, to build databases that can be accessed by stakeholders with the appropriate safeguards. In order to make the most of the rich data that is available, healthcare systems need an interconnected data infrastructure. This is an area where Europe, as mentioned, could have a significant advantage, in terms of its extensive national data sets and its networks of innovations clusters or hubs and pan-European collaborations with academia and industry, providing a prototype for the creation of centres of excellence for AI in healthcare.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Managing change.</emphasis> Managing change while introducing AI is no different to managing change in complex institutions more broadly, but for healthcare, clinical leadership is key, as is being open to identifying the right use cases that support rather than antagonise practitioners and truly augment rather than substitute their ability to deliver the best possible care to their patients. This could include prioritising solutions that focus on reducing the time people spend on routine administrative tasks, rather than those that seek to act as virtual assistants who interact directly with patients, or CDS tools that facilitate activities physicians see as core to their professional role, i.e., the clinical diagnosis. Healthcare providers also need to be transparent about the benefits and risks of AI and work with staff to harness the collective energy of their teams and capitalise on the opportunities AI can bring. It may not be a rapid process, but it soon becomes increasingly rewarding for practitioners and is an important part of the overall adoption process.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Investing in new talent and creating new roles.</emphasis> Healthcare organizations need to consider how they will develop and recruit the new roles that will be critical to the successful introduction and adoption of AI, such as data scientists or data engineers. Demand for such skills is heating up across industries and the competition for talent will be fierce, but many young data professionals find a true vocation in healthcare and its mission and are excited about the potential of digital health and AI. Developing flexible, agile models to attract and retain such talent will be a key part of these organizations' people strategy.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Working at scale.</emphasis> The lessons from public- and private-sector actors aiming to develop AI in healthcare to date suggest that scale matters-largely due to the resources needed to develop robust AI solutions or make them cost-efficient. Not every hospital will be able to afford to attract new AI talent, or have access to enough data to make algorithms meaningful. Smaller organizations can benefit from working in innovation clusters that bring together AI, digital health, biomedical research, translational research or other relevant fields. Larger organizations can develop into centres of excellence that pave the way for regional and public-private collaborations to scale AI in European healthcare.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regulation, policy making and liability, and managing risk.</emphasis> Responsibility for AI solutions-both clinical and technical-is split today between healthcare organizations and their staff. Interviewees emphasised the importance of clarifying whether AI will be regulated as a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">product</emphasis> or as a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tool</emphasis> that supports decision making, and of introducing a consistent regulatory approach for AI similar to that provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on medicines or by national authorities on medical devices. Another issue to be clarified across Europe is the extent to which patients' access to some AI tools needs to be regulated or restricted to prescription. The issue of liability and risk management is a particular challenge. Patient safety is paramount, but healthcare providers also have to think about the professional accountability of their clinicians, as well the protection of their organizations from reputational, legal or financial risk. Healthcare lawyers interviewed in this report were clear that accountability ultimately rests with the clinician under current laws. Innovators are also proactively addressing related risks. Many are putting new processes in place and ensuring a \"compliance by design\" approach is at the core of product development.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Funding.</emphasis> The reimbursement of medicines and medical devices across Europe is complicated and is even less clear when it comes to AI solutions. The responsibility for decisions on the reimbursement of a medicine or device rests with national and local payor organizations depending on the country, and this decision usually covers what will be reimbursed and at what price. Clear criteria for the potential reimbursement of AI applications will be crucial for its adoption at scale, alongside creative funding models that ensure the benefits are shared across organizations.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What this could mean for healthcare organizations</emphasis></h><p>European healthcare providers need to assess what their distinctive role or contribution can be in introducing or scaling AI in healthcare. They need to take stock of their capabilities, level of digitisation, availability and quality of data, resources and skills and then define their level of ambition for AI as it fits with their strategic goals. They should also define the enablers they need to put in place. These could include creating an AI ecosystem through partnerships to codevelop the right solutions for their population; codeveloping a compelling narrative on AI with patients and practitioners; defining and developing the right use cases jointly with end users; defining and addressing skill gaps in digital literacy for their staff; refining their value proposition for AI talent; addressing data-quality, access, governance and interoperability issues; and shaping a culture of entrepreneurship. All these themes were echoed by the healthcare professionals in the survey, who listed the top three things healthcare organizations could do, as: bringing together multidisciplinary teams with the right skills, improving the quality and robustness of data and identifying the right use cases.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What this could mean for health systems</emphasis></h><p>European health systems can play a more fundamental role in catalysing the introduction and scaleup of AI. Key actions they could take include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Develop a regional or national AI strategy for healthcare, defining a medium- and longer-term vision and goals, specific initiatives, resources and performance indicators. Define use cases to support through targeted funding and incentives to enable scaling of AI solutions across the system; ensure these deliver against both clinical and operational outcomes.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Set standards for digitisation, data quality and completeness, data access, governance, risk management, security and sharing, and system interoperability; incentivise adherence to standards through a combination of performance and financial incentives.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Redesign workforce planning and clinical-education processes to address the needs of both future healthcare and AI-focused professionals; and invest upfront in upskilling frontline staff and designing lifelong-learning programmes through continuing professional development and degrees or diplomas for healthcare professionals.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Provide incentives and guidance for healthcare organizations to collaborate in centres of excellence/clusters of innovation at the regional or national level.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Address AI regulation, liability and funding issues, creating the right environment for appropriate, safe and effective AI solutions to be adopted but minimising the risk to practitioners.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Ensure this is reflected in funding and reimbursement mechanisms for innovation in healthcare-the number one priority for survey respondents from health systems, alongside simplifying data-governance and data-sharing processes.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What this could mean for Europe</emphasis></h><p>Our early analyses of levels of VC investment and AI-related clinical trials, as well as the number of companies and M&amp;A deals in digital health and AI, show this is a fast-moving market where Europe, as a group of countries, plays a growing role internationally alongside the US and China. The scale needed to effectively roll out AI in healthcare may place a toll on smaller EU Member States but could be easily reached through collaborations across Europe. Interviewees and survey respondents were clear on the potential impact of the EU in helping deliver the promise of AI, faster and at a greater scale for Europe's population. They highlighted the following specific strands of work that could be considered:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Consolidating funding against strategic AI priorities.</emphasis> Defining a few concrete priorities for AI in European healthcare and consolidating funding to support them strategically could provide a much-needed stimulus to fast-track promising developments in AI for healthcare.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Creating a level playing field across Europe.</emphasis> Common standards on data, regulation, access, privacy or interoperability, and shared requirements on data exchange, would enable innovators to scale AI solutions cost-effectively, while focusing their energies on entrepreneurship. It would also enable patients, practitioners and health systems to develop the same confidence in new AI solutions that they have now in new medicines and medical devices that have undergone European approval.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clarifying key aspects of regulation around product approval, accountability, governance and litigation.</emphasis> The EU can help remove barriers to adopting AI at the national and local level, providing clarity on approval processes across Europe, potentially creating regulatory centres of excellence for AI regulation, and setting expectations on accountability and liability.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Encouraging and supporting the creation of centres of excellence for AI in healthcare.</emphasis> This can help consolidate scarce AI talent in high-profile and agile networks that can move quickly from design to implementation and spearhead the introduction of new capabilities in national health systems. These centres of excellence would also lead the way in adopting and implementing technologies and approaches developed elsewhere. Indeed, their expertise in applying approaches to improve care will be as critical as their expertise in developing those approaches in the first place. They can also ensure that talent creation and continuous learning are prioritised and enhanced at the European level.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Playing an active role in AI.</emphasis> This will ensure that the thoughtful European approach to ethics, health data and patient confidentiality shapes the AI sector, in the same way that GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) has for privacy protection.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Overall, this report highlights the excitement of Europe-wide stakeholders, healthcare professionals, investors and innovators about the impact of AI on European healthcare, and about the thoughtful approach taken across Europe to ensure this delivers ethical and trustworthy AI. It also highlights that this is only the latest view across Europe and internationally-speed is of the essence if Europe is to continue playing a leading role in shaping the AI of the future to deliver its true potential to European health systems and their patients.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCKNSY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCKNSY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD5-K7P1-JB24-R0KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470364</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 McKinsey &amp;

He thinks, with more funding, we could reverse the aging process fairly soon and he's running on the \"vote for me and live forever\" ticket. Pledging eternal life is unusual, but it's probably no less likely than some of the other party promises I've seen. </p><p>Because it's prohibitively expensive to get on state ballots in the US, Istvan has to rely on stunts to get media coverage: hence the bus. But some of what he is up to is certainly interesting. </p><p>On day two, we went to a \"bio-hacking\" lab, because Istvan wanted to get a chip implanted into his body. The lab is in a small town called Tahachapi, in central California which, when we visit, is hosting \"Grindfest\", a meeting of bio-hackers, or \"grinders\" - citizen scientists, if you will - who like to perform experimental, DIY technology on their own bodies in the interests of improving human beings. </p><p>Earlier this year, a number of grinders gained notoriety when four of them set out to explore infra-red sight. One of them had chlorin e6 insulin and saline dropped into his eyes, after having spent several months on a Vitamin A deficient diet. He had improved vision in the dark for several hours, with no noticeable long term effects. </p><p>Some scientists, of course, were worried about the way in which the experiment was conducted, saying it wasn't scientific, and was possibly irresponsible. The grinders argue they are very careful - many of them are health professionals - and they don't want to wait for impossibly lengthy and expensive ethics committees that stymie interesting and innovative work. </p><p>Istvan is getting what's called a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip. It's tiny - smaller than an uncooked grain of rice, and usually implanted in the skin between the thumb and index finger. These chips can store small amounts of information on them that be recognised by other compatible devices as long as they're programmed in a certain way. You might, for example, include important health or personal information on there that a reader - such as a smartphone - would instantly recognise. There are millions of these little chips in all sorts of daily devices, but putting one inside the body is far less common. </p><p>Not here though, where nearly everyone already has one. One has set up his phone so he can scan the chip in his thumb with it to unlock the screen. A 19 year-old - who also had magnets in his fingers to feel electro-magnetic fields - took me over to his car, and unlocked it with his hand. He then started it with his hand. He'd reprogrammed the car himself. </p><p>Grinders are certainly smart - in a geeky way. They read academic papers, discuss studies, formulate ideas, build stuff they've bought from hardware stores or the net, try it on themselves, and share the results. They are pushing the boundaries of what's possible, and by doing it all on themselves they circumnavigate some of the ethical regulations that might otherwise stop them. </p><p>Is this sort of citizen science - risk, exploratory, home-made and quick - where the technology of the future will come from? Some of it may well become everyday technology - I saw sound-transmitting magnets implanted in ears (allowing the wearer to listen to music without anyone else knowing), and someone working on a device to insert into the top of your hand that responds to gestures: so flipping the bird at your light switch could turn it on and off. </p><p>For the bio-hackers, much of the technology is at least one part lifestyle choice: cosmetic as well as practical. But many see social and health benefits for everyone in the years ahead. One grinder I spoke to is working on something to measure your heart-rate at all times, and alert you immediately if something goes awry. The grinders worry that this sort of technological development could be captured by big tech/pharma companies and its benefits limited to those who can afford it. These bio-hackers make their work open source so anyone can use it. </p><p>Of course, that means some might use their technology for ill, but that's always a risk. And I can understand why scientists might worry. Some of this is dangerous stuff - more than one grinder I spoke to had put magnets or chips in without proper sterilised equipment, and subsequently had to remove it. </p><p>Then again, Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist of them all, experimented on himself too. I can certainly see the benefits - and not just the big social benefits. Imagine it - a chip in my hand, and I'd never have to worry about losing my keys again.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Transparency for Big Tech: The Least-Bad Option</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new Wall Street Journal expose finding that \"Google has increasingly re-engineered and interfered with search results to a far greater degree than the company and its executives have acknowledged\" is sure to bolster efforts from the company's opponents to break it up or cripple it with regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There is a through-the-looking-glass quality to the debate for those of us who have spent the last 15 years or so in the Net Neutrality wars.</p><p> The same players \u2013 including Big Tech companies themselves and their surrogates \u2013 who have told us for years that only heavy-handed government neutrality regulations can save us from ISPs manipulating traffic and acting as gatekeepers are now recoiling in horror at the prospect of a neutrality regulation for Big Tech companies that are engaging in precisely such manipulation.</p><p> At the same time, many of the people who most strongly opposed Obama's mangled form of net neutrality are now insistent that we repeat the same big government mistakes to address the behavior of Big Tech.</p><p> Senator Ted Cruz brought Section 230 \u2013 the provision of U.S. law that provides intermediary liability protection to the tech companies \u2013 into the scope of the debate by suggesting that limiting such a government-granted benefit could provide a mechanism for conservatives ideologically suspect of regulation to address the perceived thumb these companies had on the scale for Democratic candidates and their liberal allies.</p><p> Senator Josh Hawley pushed this idea to an extreme almost shocking from a Republican \u2013 a bill requiring certification of political neutrality by federal bureaucrats to retain 230 protection.</p><p> Cruz and Hawley understand something too many professional analysts on the right ignore at their peril \u2013 the conservative base is nearing a boiling point in its hatred of Big Tech and sees this as a central front in the culture war, not a venue for economic policy subject to ideological constraints.</p><p> How, in this context, can we chart a path forward that can satisfy this base anger without betraying free-market principles?</p><p> The answer could lie in FCC Chairman Aji Pai's brilliant resolution of the net neutrality issue.Not only have none of the predicted negative consequences occurred since Pai's more free-market version of net neutrality was enacted, but to the contrary data speeds have risen sharply, investment is up, and there have been no notable episodes of discrimination by ISPs.</p><p> The heart of the Pai order is a transparency rule, which replaces heavy-handed regulation with market discipline \u2013 in effect, if you want to treat traffic in a non-neutral fashion you can, but you have to explain what you're doing to your customers.</p><p> Ironically, the Big Tech companies continue to pursue reimposition of the heavy-handed Obama neutrality regulations on ISPs even as they fend off efforts to similarly regulate themselves or limit their liability protections.</p><p> But the success of the Pai order suggests a much more elegant solution: Big Tech should be subject to a transparency rule and, if they do in fact discriminate against certain content, they should explain how to their customers.</p><p> Such a rule could require clear disclosure of how traffic is treated, and clear specification of the standards used for limiting speech, including any possible viewpoint discrimination.Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral could be subject to civil complaints if they violate those representations.</p><p> A transparency rule would avoid the perils of more heavy-handed government regulation, dissipate the distrust toward Big Tech from the left and right, and harmonize the rules for ISPs with the rules for the edge giants they are increasingly competing with in the advertising market.</p><p> Crafting a transparency rule for Big Tech is easier said than done, of course. But just as with regulation of ISPs, it could be the least-bad option.</p><p> \u2013</p><p> Copyright 2019 Phil Kerpen, distributed by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.</p><p> Mr. Kerpen is the president of American Commitment and the author of \"Democracy Denied.\" Kerpen can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:phil@americancommitment.org\">phil@americancommitment.org</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVT-82a213d0d7c637d3ecac82f757fd7415d5042b4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899AA106C8F1A NWBKVT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJT-H721-DXVP-V0RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409761</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Caledonian-Record Publishing Company Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.
