Mohamed El-Erian said in an interview with Yahoo Finance[2] that the overall valuation of US tech companies is a \"real question mark\" to him.\"The theme underlying the performance of the Nasdaq, I like. The valuation I'm less excited about,\" he said on Yahoo's show \"On the Move.\"El-Erian highlighted the tech giants' strong balance sheets, robust cash flow, competent management, and an increase in demand for their services during the COVID-19 outbreak, and suggested they would continue to do well and outperform.\"But it's the overall valuation that's the real question mark for me,\" the economist said.\"I can see them continuing to outperform because they have both the resiliency and agility to manage this economy. </p><p>I just don't know whether the valuation still makes sense to tell you the truth.\"El-Erian's comments came a day after CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google's parent Alphabet testified before Congress[3] on matters related to whether the big four have an unfair advantage over the rest of the sector.

Who'd have thunk it? Curbing rentier capitalism would be bad for rentiers. It's only recently that more and more economic research and press interest about the cost of monopolies has taken the sheen off tech giants like Google and Amazon as it becomes increasingly obvious that their outsized results result from the abuse of market power, and not providing better services (if you think Google search circa 2019 can hold a candle to Google search circa 2009, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you).The one area of significant bipartisan distrust is big tech monopolies. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/A3d9Qr9rmH\">https://t.co/A3d9Qr9rmH</url>[1] \u2014 Matt Stoller (@matthewstoller) June 3, 2019[2]By Wolf Richter, publisher of Wolf Street[3]. Originally published at Wolf Street[4] It's a rare moment in recent years that US government regulators are suddenly going after four tech and social media giants simultaneously - Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple.These four companies are part of my FANGMAN index that also includes Microsoft, Nvidia, and Netflix. The index dove 4.3% today, the biggest percentage decline since the infamous 4.6% drop on December 24, 2018. In terms of dollars, $137 billion in market capitalization was wiped out. Over the past four trading days the FANGMAN index has dropped by 6.6%. I highlighted today's move in red (market cap data via YCharts[5]):The index has gone through some brain-twisting surges and plunges over the past two years. It peaked on August 31, 2018 (at $4.63 trillion), then plunged 29% by December 24 (to $3.29 trillion), then exploded 40% higher by April 29. But that day, at $4.61 trillion, it failed to take out the August high. And then the selling started. Since April 29, the FANGMAN index has dropped 14.0%, or by $645 billion in market cap, giving up 49% of the post-Christmas rally in just five weeks. I track these stocks because of their outsized weight in the overall stock market, and because they range from very overvalued to immensely overvalued, depending on the stock - and symptomatic for much of the stock market. But given the sell-off over the past few weeks, what happened since Friday in terms of regulatory pressure was quite a handful. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal[6] reported that, according to its sources, the Justice Department 'has been laying the groundwork' for an anti-trust investigation into Google, the largest advertising platform in the world. Reuters reported on Monday that Google still 'declined comment.' The WSJ summarized the problem: The rise of big tech has seen three corporate titans that didn't exist 30 years ago - Amazon, Google, and Facebook - suddenly amassing the power to sway large parts of the U.S. economy and society, from the stock market to political discourse, from personal shopping habits to how small businesses sell their wares. With their enormous size and dominance have come network advantages, data caches and economies of scale that can make it challenging for new rivals to succeed. Many firms that compete with those giants in one sector also depend on their platforms to reach customers, and they complain of being unfairly squeezed. Google has already been hit with three mega-fines by the European Union's antitrust regulators, totaling \u20ac8.2 billion in three years: In June 2017, Google was fined \u20ac2.42 billion for abusing its position as the top search engine by giving preferential treatment to its own comparison-shopping service. In July 2018, Google was fined \u20ac4.34 billion for pushing smartphone makers into using its Android operating system. And in March 2019, Google was fined \u20ac1.5 billion concerning its search advertising. Over the weekend, it was reported that the FTC would have jurisdiction over a potential antitrust probe into Amazon's practices. And on Monday, Reuters reported that 'Amazon declined comment on Monday.' It was reported that, according to sources, the FTC would also have jurisdiction over a potential antitrust probe into Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC has long been investigating Facebook for privacy violations. In 2012, it approved a final settlement[7] with Facebook, 'resolving charges that Facebook deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.' This settlement included a consent decree that Facebook subsequently was alleged to have violated by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica. In April, Facebook said that it expected to be fined between $3 billion and $5 billion for these violations. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, lambasted it as a 'bargain for Facebook'[8] that doesn't go nearly far enough in holding the company accountable to its users and forcing changes. 'Even a fine in the billions is imply a write-down for the company, and large penalties have done little to deter large tech firms,' they wrote in the letter. 'Fines alone are insufficient. Far-reaching reforms must finally hold Facebook accountable to consumers. We're deeply concerned that one-time penalties of any size every few years are woefully in adequate to effectively restrain Facebook.' They proposed a slew of reforms, including that 'personal responsibility must be recognized from the top of the corporate board down to the product development teams.' And they added, 'It is also time for the FTC to learn from a history of broken and under-enforced consent orders.' And it was reported over the weekend, again according to sources, that the Justice Department would have jurisdiction of a potential antitrust probe into Apple, which is already entangled in an investigation by EU regulators, following a complaint by Spotify that it abuses its power over app downloads. That puts the four companies simultaneously under the US regulatory microscope. And clearly, officials have been fanning out to let the media know. On Monday, Reuters[9] reported that 'people briefed on the matter say neither the Justice Department nor the FTC have contacted Google or Amazon about any probes, and that company executives are unaware of what issues regulators are reviewing.' So they got their info from the media. Divvying up jurisdiction was the first essential step. The rest might take years. Sources told Reuters on Monday that the government 'is gearing up to investigate whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google misuse their massive market power setting up what could be an unprecedented, wide-ranging probe of some of the world's largest companies.' Congress appears to be on board, according to Reuters: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told Reuters that the business model of companies like Google and Facebook needs to be scrutinized. 'It's got so much power, and so unregulated,' he said. Another Republican, Senator Marsha Blackburn, said the panel would do what she called a 'deeper dive' into big tech companies. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said on Monday that U.S. enforcers have to do more than wring their hands about the companies' clout, also weighed in. 'Their predatory power grabs demand strict ...iff investigation ...titrust action,' the Connecticut senator wrote on Twitter. So let's see how that will turn out \u2014 if the outcome will effectively change business practices, or if any fines will just raise the cost of doing business, costs that can be written off as 'one-time charges' that analysts and the financial media eagerly exclude from earnings reports and hastily send into oblivion where they don't matter. But for now, the FANGMAN index shows that there is a price to pay.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/06/fangman-stocks-crushed-by-potential-unprecedented-wide-ranging-probe-into-google-apple-facebook-amazon.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/06/fangman-stocks-crushed-by-potential-unprecedented-wide-ranging-probe-into-google-apple-facebook-amazon.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> ;This entry was posted in Banana republic[10], Economic fundamentals[11], Free markets and their discontents[12], Guest Post[13], Market inefficiencies[14], Politics[15], Regulations and regulators[16], Technology and innovation[17] on June 4, 2019[18] by Yves Smith[19].

That was the general sentiment towards regulators and politicians over their handling of the big four tech platforms: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, the so-called \"Fangs\". How come they pay so little tax and escape the regulatory burdens of established rivals? Dame Carolyn McCall, the ITV boss, is hardly alone in finding it \"quite odd\" that Facebook can pay only \u00a35.1 million UK corporation tax despite having \u00a3842 million in sales over here. Why, too, should the \"publishers\" Facebook and Google be allowed to self-regulate? \"My biggest issue is how they are going to regulate <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.online.No\">www.online.No</url> one knows how they are going to do that\".</p><p>She called them \"exponential\" businesses.

Not remotely, according to the mood at the summit. One fear is that regulators and politicians don't understand Big Tech, not even culture secretary Matt Hancock, who says he does. Reining them in may take a consumer backlash, with users clawing back their data. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal shows why.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-138993519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNB-1SF1-JBVM-Y0XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 27, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That was the general sentiment towards regulators and politicians over their handling of the big four tech platforms: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, the so-called \"Fangs\". How come they pay so little tax and escape the regulatory burdens of established rivals? Dame Carolyn McCall, the ITV boss, is hardly alone in finding it \"quite odd\" that Facebook can pay only \u00a35.1 million UK corporation tax despite having \u00a3842 million in sales over here. Why, too, should the \"publishers\" Facebook and Google be allowed to self-regulate? \"My biggest issue is how they are going to regulate <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.online.No\">www.online.No</url> one knows how they are going to do that\".</p><p>She called them \"exponential\" businesses. As Matthew Taylor, boss of the Royal Society for encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, put it: \"The data effect is reinforcing the network effect\". He said Big Tech (the fifth \"Faang\" is Apple) had \"unparalleled power in the history of capitalism\" and suggested regulators break up Amazon.</p><p>How likely is that any time soon? Not remotely, according to the mood at the summit. One fear is that regulators and politicians don't understand Big Tech, not even culture secretary Matt Hancock, who says he does. Reining them in may take a consumer backlash, with users clawing back their data. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal shows why.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-139008010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNB-1SF1-JBVM-Y1B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 27, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

FANG stocks will have another big day as Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet report, after the Justice Department announced a sweeping probe into anti-competitive practices among big tech companies. Chip giant Intel also issues earnings amid buzz that it's near a deal with Apple. Starbucks reports too.</p><h>Earnings From FANG Stocks</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">E-commerce leader Amazon will report late, and Wall Street expects EPS to rise 4% to $5.29, the slowest growth in seven quarters, as revenue grows 18% to $62.57 billion. The results come a week after Amazon had its fourth Prime Day shopping event, which saw a record 175 million items sold and more people signing up for memberships. Alphabet\u00a0reports late as well, and analysts see EPS of $11.50, down 2%, with revenue climbing 18% to $30.9 billion.</p><p>But the focus during the conference calls will be on the Justice Department investigation. Earnings from the FANG stocks also come a week after executives from Google, Amazon, Facebook and\u00a0Apple were grilled on Capitol Hill during an antitrust hearing. Meanwhile, European Union regulators are also getting more aggressive with big U.S. tech companies.</p><p>Shares of Amazon closed up 0.3% at 2000.81 on the , and Alphabet slipped 0.7% to 1139.73.</p><h>Intel Earnings</h><p>The chip giant\u00a0reports late Thursday, and EPS is seen sliding 14% to 89 cents, with sales dropping 8% to $15.6 billion. As with the FANG stocks, attention will likely turn away from Intel earnings and toward news that\u00a0Apple is near a deal to buy the modem chip business of\u00a0Intel.\u00a0Apple could pay $1 billion or more for Intel patents and staff, the\u00a0 reported Monday. In April,\u00a0Intel announced it would shutter its modem chip business just as a landmark Apple-Qualcomm patent-and-royalties settlement was unveiled, raising\u00a0speculation of a possible Apple-Intel modem chip deal.</p><p>Intel stock rose 2.3% to 52.92 Wednesday.</p><h>Starbucks Earnings</h><p>The coffee giant reports fiscal Q3 results after the close, and\u00a0Wall Street expects Q3 EPS to climb 16% to 72 cents, as revenue increases 6% to $6.685 billion. Same-store sales are expected to rise 4.2%, with comps up 4.5% in the Americas, 0.9% in the Europe-Middle East-Africa segment, and 3.6% in the China and Asia-Pacific region, according to Consensus Metrix</p><p>Starbucks stock has soared more than 40% so far this year, and since late May has climbed more than 20%. One of the reasons is that\u00a0Arabica coffee futures have been falling since October and took another sharp dive in June. They have since recovered somewhat but started falling again this month.</p><p>Starbucks CFO Patrick Grismer also boasted at the Piper Jaffray Consumer Marketplace Conference last month that consumer research indicates that while the firm is strong across all demographics, it \"enjoys even higher levels of preference\" with millennials and Gen Z consumers.</p><p>Starbucks stock edged up 0.6% to 90.65 Wednesday, just 1% below its record high reached last week.</p><h>Other Earnings</h><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Atlassian reports fiscal Q4 earnings late, and analysts estimate EPS of 16 cents, up 23%, with revenue rising 36% to $331 million.\u00a0Increased hiring in R&amp;D and investments in cloud computing may lower the collaboration software developer's operating margins.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Comcast reports early, and analysts estimate 15% EPS growth to 75 cents, with revenue up 25% to $27.185 billion.\u00a0Results will include the recent acquisition of U.K.-based Sky.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Stryker is expected late and analysts see the medical device maker's EPS rising 10% to $1.93 as revenue grows 8% to $3.605 billion.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Columbia Sportswear posts earnings after the close, and EPS is seen collapsing 94% to a penny as revenue ticks up 5% to $507 million.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Deckers Outdoor reports fiscal Q1 results late, and analysts expect the Ugg and Teva footwear maker to report per-share losses widening to $1.15 from 98 cents a year ago, as revenue grows 3.6% to $260 million.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Mattel reports after the close, and Wall Street sees per-share losses narrowing to 35 cents from 56 cents a year ago, as revenue dips 2.4% to $967 million.

That's why three of the four FANG stocks\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Amazon.com, Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet \u2014 along with tech icon Apple have taken a beating lately as investors worry about government and court actions defanging their businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wall Street, analysts say rumblings about antitrust investigations create \"headline risks\" for the FANGs and Apple, sometimes known as .</p><p>\"The headlines are, once again, ugly for big U.S. tech,\" Macquarie Research analyst Benjamin Schachter said in a report to clients Tuesday. \"This is clearly not going to let up anytime soon. Still, headline risks have been around for years, but, for various reasons, they are particularly acute now.\"</p><p>He added, \"Heading into a U.S. presidential election year, we expect headline risks to increase. Notably, there seems to be bipartisan support for creating such headlines. Taking on big U.S. tech seems to be in vogue across the political spectrum. This will have legs in our view.\"</p><p>A bigger worry than investigations is the possibility of regulatory remedies, Schachter said. Those remedies could include breaking up companies, fines, data privacy constraints, and other actions, he said. But any enforcement actions could be years away, he said.</p><h>FANG Stocks: Breakup Risks Relatively Low?</h><p>Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said the risk of large-cap tech company breakups, however, is relatively low.</p><p>\"We view the likelihood of 'nuclear options' such as forced breakups of Google, Facebook or Amazon, and/or exposing search or feed algorithms, as fairly low,\" he said in his note to clients. Sebastian sees \"the likelihood of antitrust action short of breakup as moderate; and regulation around privacy and security as relatively high.\"</p><p>The historical emphasis on \"consumer harm\" in U.S. antitrust cases could provide refuge for Facebook and Google, he said. That's because their services are mostly free to consumers.</p><p>Raymond James analysts said in their note that the biggest impact from the antitrust investigations could be that they prevent the internet giants from doing significant acquisitions in the future.</p><h>Starting To Recover</h><p>The FANG stocks and Apple sold off sharply on Monday amid reports of U.S. antitrust investigations. On Tuesday, they started to recover.\u00a0On the , Alphabet \u2014 the hardest hit on Monday \u2014 rose 1.5% to 1,054.49. Meanwhile, Amazon increased 2.2% to 1,729.56 and Facebook rose 2% to 167.50.\u00a0Apple made the biggest charge, climbing 3.7% to 179.64.</p><p>The fourth of the FANG stocks, Netflix, hasn't been caught up in the regulatory and legal whirlwind. But Netflix has its own challenges, namely rising competition from Walt Disney and others.</p><p>On , news reports indicated that U.S. regulatory bodies were preparing to start investigations into possible anti-competitive activities by Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Department of Justice will look into the business practices of Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will investigate Amazon and Facebook. The DOJ and FTC share responsibility for enforcing  and coordinate on which companies they oversee.</p><p>Sensing an opportunity to score points with voters, politicians have jumped on the bandwagon, calling for restraints on big tech firms.</p><h>House Judiciary Committee Launches Antitrust Investigation</h><p>The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee  it has launched a bipartisan investigation into competition in digital markets. The investigation will include\u00a0a series of hearings by the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law.</p><p>\"A small number of dominant, unregulated platforms have extraordinary power over commerce, communication, and information online,\" the panel said in a statement that did not name any companies. \"There are concerns\u00a0that these platforms have the incentive and ability to harm the competitive process.\"</p><p>Some politicians, such as Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, are calling for the breakup of big tech companies including Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>The FANG stocks and Apple also face increased regulatory scrutiny in the European Union.</p><p>Plus, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled  that consumers can press ahead with a lawsuit that accuses Apple of using its market dominance to artificially inflate prices at its App Store.</p><p>Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter at  for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor companies.</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4625799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8G-5N51-JCBB-K185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

This embarks on a wide-ranging review of a tech giant that both Democrats and Republicans say threatens competition and consumers. The FTC also reportedly is considering a preliminary injunction against Facebook over antitrust concerns related to how its products interact.</p><p>Further, the European Union has also imposed or threatened fines and regulations against Facebook, Amazon and Google. These also revolve around privacy and antitrust matters.</p><p>\"Regulatory risks exist but we don't see it as a game changer,\" said Wedbush's Ives. \"We think FANG stocks will move 15%-to-20% higher over the next 6-to-9 months.\"</p><h>Big Companies, High Pressure</h><p>The FANG acronym was coined in 2013 by CNBC's \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer to collectively refer to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Apple was added to the list in 2017, expanding the name to FAANG, though FANG remains the more commonly used search term.</p><p>The pressure put on the five companies is easy to understand, due to their influence and gargantuan size.</p><p>Facebook dominates social networking with more than 2 billion users. Amazon rules the e-commerce jungle as well as the market for cloud-computing services. Netflix is the leader in subscription video on demand, though competition is intensifying.</p><p>Alphabet is at the forefront of internet search and also plays an influential role in smartphones with its Google Android platform. In addition, Alphabet's YouTube dominates its field, with billions of hours of user video.</p><p>Apple has retained its loyal following for decades. That started with its computer users and strengthened after it virtually created the smartphone market.</p><h>Fallout Of Cambridge Analytica</h><p>As an example of FANG stock resilience, take a look at Facebook. It was in 2018 that revelations surfaced about the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and how it improperly gained personal details on . The investigations expanded to include a host of additional privacy mishaps.</p><p>In July, Facebook agreed to  and abide by sweeping new restrictions imposed by the Federal Trade Commission. The fine was the result of allegations Facebook deceived users about its handling of their personal information. The three FTC commissioners who  in a 3-2 decision called the record-breaking fine a \"historic victory\" for American consumers.</p><p>But Wall Street shrugged as Facebook stock climbed 1% that day. And those\u00a0who bought and held Facebook reaped a 56% gain during 2019.</p><p>A similar picture unfolds for\u00a0any or all of the other four in the group. Apple stock soared 86% in 2019. Alphabet jumped 28%, while Netflix climbed 21% and Amazon added 23%.</p><h>FANG Stocks: Long In The Tooth?</h><p>Yet Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, thinks portfolio managers see FANG stocks as getting long in the tooth. The buy-and-hold strategy of FANG stocks is likely to keep working in 2020. But there are plenty of other attractive issues to buy and watch, he says.</p><p>\"If you really wanted to make big money you just threw it at the FANG stocks and did well,\" Morgan told IBD. But the idea of just buying FANG stocks and ignoring the rest of the tech sector may not work as well in 2020, he adds.</p><p>\"There's more to tech than just the FANG stocks,\" Morgan said. \"Portfolio managers are becoming more discerning in terms of where to put their money. They're not just blindly buying the top five or six stocks.\"</p><p>Stocks that Morgan likes include AMD, up 155% in 2018, and Lam Research, which has more than doubled this year. Another is Microsoft, up 57%. He\u00a0owns Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and business software maker\u00a0Salesforce.com, which is up 20%.</p><p>For Wedbush's Ives,\u00a0other technology stocks that he views optimistically include Microsoft, as a core play in cloud computing, CyberArk, in the cybersecurity market, and AMD in the chip sector.</p><p>Please follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at  for more on tech stocks, analysis and financial markets.</p><p>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-5311407</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWP-5591-JCBB-K11D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

Developments at companies such as Amazon and Tesla have prompted investors to take a hard, fresh look at the firms' growth prospects and the stocks' lofty prices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook Inc.was hit with a data-privacy scandal. Amazon.com Inc.came under attack again by President Trump over its sales taxes and U.S. Postal Service contract. Concern mounted about Tesla Inc.'s cash needs. The self-driving vehicle industry was roiled by a pedestrian fatality in Arizona caused by an autonomous Uber vehicle.</p><p>Because the tech giants' stocks -- and the stocks' enormous price gains in the last two years -- have attracted an increasingly larger following, their abrupt declines helped bring down the overall stock market in March.</p><p>For instance, the NYSE FANG+ index plunged nearly 8% this week before finishing nearly unchanged Thursday. The index tracks the so-called FANG stocks -- <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Amazon, Netflix Inc.and Google parent Alphabet Inc. -- and six others, including Tesla and Twitter Inc.</p><p>The broader, tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which soared 28% last year and gained an additional 5.4% in the first two months of this year, fell 2.9% in March, its worst monthly showing since January 2016.</p><p>\"The gains were easy the last few years\" with the big tech shares, said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial Group. \"Investors haven't been challenged much with these stocks. Now, there's been news that questions their assumptions.</p><p>\"Investors are now saying, 'Maybe the stock isn't worth as much as we thought,' \" he said.</p><p>But as Wall Street heads into a three-day break -- the market is closed for Good Friday -- the question is whether investors used the bad news simply to take some of their big profits or whether the developments point to trends that could curb the companies' longer-term business prospects, thus making current stock prices overvalued.</p><p>Consider: Even after tech's dreary week, Amazon is still up 66% over the last 12 months, compared with a 12% gain in the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. <person><nameText>Netflix </nameText></person>has doubled in price and Twitter has surged 93% in the period.</p><p>The gains mainly reflect investors' expectations that the firms enjoy dominance in their various spheres and will continue their heady growth in the years to come.</p><p>With gains like those, the negative news gave many investors an apt reason to cash out. And some of those investors were momentum players with little interest in the companies' long-term outlooks, Ware said.</p><p>\"These folks are not fundamentally rooted in their analysis,\" Ware said. \"They're just renting the stock when there's momentum. And when that momentum starts to turn, these folks will flee and take their profits.\"</p><p>For those investors looking at the tech giants for the long term, \"one of the questions we're getting is whether the recent declines in these stocks is indicative of something more sinister in the market,\" said Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors in Torrance.</p><p>\"We don't subscribe to that\" thinking and, in fact, see the stocks' recent pullback as \"making them more attractive,\" Phillips said.</p><p>One example for Phillips is Amazon.

The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ both up one and three quarters percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">European Indices this morning, are mixed. We did get GDP numbers out for the U.K. The FT 100 is down 43 points, CAC Quarante is down 6, and the DAX Index is up 38. Britain's better-than-expected GDP report this morning, it was up 3/10 of a percent on the GDP. It did ease some recession fears. However, we know that the Eurozone is having a hard time generating any growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">German exports were also up, though. Another good report here, up 7/10 of a percent in July, that was Germany. And Germany's DAX Index is up 37 points right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan, not as positive, second quarter GDP was up, but it was slower than expected, up 1.3 percent for the GDP in Japan, Nikkei Average up one half of one percent. In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, mostly higher, with the exception of Hong Kong, as you see, as protesters were on the street, once again, over the weekend.</p><p>Well, they are back, members of Congress returning to Washington today, facing a big to-do list, all of the hot-button issues on their plate, coming up this morning. Then, there is this, the Twitter effect, J.P. Morgan's new index measures the impact of President Trump's tweets. yes, we've got this Volfefe Index. We'll tell you about it.</p><p>And then, making it official, how the University of Tennessee is making a young fan's viral shirt into a reality. Good story there at the end of the day. We will tell you about it.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Trump administration proposing a privatization of these mortgage finance giants, which could keep them at the center of the U.S. housing market for years to come.</p><p>Joining me right now to talk about that and a host of other topics is U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: Hi, Maria, it's good to be with you as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So you -- the Treasury has submitted the housing reform plan to the president. Can you -- I have it here, 53 pages worth of it. Can you talk about the housing plan to, once again, privatize these companies, these government-sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and how that should play out from your standpoint, sir.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, as you know, these have been in conservatorship for 11 years and we think now is the time to recapitalize them, make them stronger, make sure that taxpayers aren't at risk and eventually erase third party capital so that we restructure them and that in another housing downturn taxpayers are not at risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- so one of the issues here is you've got to get private capital, you've got to get competition in the marketplace, but you also have to get capital to come into this situation. So how are you going to do it?</p><p>Pull out some of the more important items from this housing reform plan that you think is going to solve -- that you think will, in fact, move the needle on that?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, the first step is we are in the process of negotiating with the FHFA on our current lines and we expect in the near term we'll have an agreement where we will allow both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to retain their earnings, which will be a significant increase in capital and a step in the right direction to us ultimately raising third party capital.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I think you make a really important point because, you know, I was reading a couple of the comments on Twitter and on social media and, you know, people are saying, look, how soon are we going to get Fannie and Freddie out of conservatorship now that you had a pretty good win the other day, the ruling, the APA claim in the -- in the fifth circuit. And the fact that people feel that it was unconstitutional in the first place to force these companies to have all their profits go to the Treasury and tell them when and when they should and shouldn't pay dividends.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, I'm not going to comment on the legal case for obvious reasons, but I would say what we're focused on is is housing reform. And as part of housing reform, we do want to make sure that there is real capital in front of the taxpayers. The other issue, and I look forward to testifying at the Senate tomorrow, will be looking for bipartisan legislation to get approval to have -- to put a full faith and credit on the securities. And we think that the government should be paid for that wrap and we think there should be significant private capital in front of it. So something similar to the FDIC model or the Ginnie Mae wrap.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, look, we've talked about this before. And in the past you've -- you've actually agreed with my assessment that for a time the Obama administration was just taking money from these companies and putting it wherever they wanted. I mean the investors get totally screwed, Fannie and Freddie, and now people are saying, look, the government looted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When are we going to be able to get our money back?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, I'm not going to comment on the investors' situation, but I will comment on -- you're right, they've been in conservatorship for too long and we want to make sure they're not in conservatorship on a permanent basis. So our first choice is to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis. But if we can't do that, we're perfectly comfortable moving forward on the administrative side and making the changes we need to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, look, this is a big issue for investors, as you know. And you -- I know you don't want to touch certain things, but -- but what - - what can you tell us about the fact that this federal appeals court in New Orleans overturned the ruling, and that ruling that backed the government's right to take all of the mortgage giant's profits?</p><p>In addition to that, the judge has, Mr. Secretary, as you know, the judge has also concluded that the structure of Fannie and Freddie's regulator, that's the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is unconstitutional because of job protections for the agency's director.</p><p>What do you say?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, we've obviously been working with the Department of Justice on this case. We're reviewing the decision. And we're -- we're not going to let this stand in the way, one way or another, with housing reform. So, as I say, there is an investor issue here, which will continue to go through the legal process, but the most important issue is, regardless of that case, we will restructure Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that they have private capital in front of any taxpayer risks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How long will this take? What's the timing on that? Do you believe you can actually get new capital into the situation and allowing these companies to return to the private sector?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, I think we're -- we're going to work with Congress on the first part of this. I'd hope that if we're going to get congressional support, it will be in the next three to six months. And if we can't do that, we'll move on on the administrative front.</p><p>And as I said earlier, the first step of -- of capital will be, we expect in the very near term, to reach an agreement to allow for capital to be built up. So right now they each have three billion of capital and they have the Treasury lines and we're going to start with retaining earnings so that that's the first step in capital raise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: One -- one investor wants to know, given the -- the ruling that -- on net worth sweep that we now know was illegal, is the September sweep going to be halted? Are we going to see money go back to the investors?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, the money wouldn't go back to the investors. The money would stay in the companies. And then, obviously, the legal process will go forward.</p><p>And, obviously, the Treasury has very significant claims for the money that we've outlaid. But, you know, I expect, we're -- we're going to -- we're in the process of working with the FHFA and we're going to try to see if we can do it in September. If not, it will be very soon after that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What -- what would be a realistic timeframe in your mind that Fannie and Freddie could -- could come out of conservatorship?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Maria, it just depends. We're going to do it as quickly as we can. As I said, part of it depends on how quickly we get Congress to act. But we're going to -- we're going to make sure that we lay out a plan to getting these entities out of conservatorship. That is our goal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And tell -- and connect the dots for us for the audience. Why do you think that's going to help the housing market? What will that mean overall at the end of the day, given the fact that right now these companies control, what, 95 percent of mortgages, Mr. Secretary?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, it's these companies with FHA control a very, very big part of the market.</p><p>And let me just comment on, this is really housing reform. And we are also working with HUD on looking at reform of FHA. We want to make sure that if we fix Fannie and Freddie, we don't put the taxpayers at risk at FHA. So that -- that's also something we're looking very closely at and we're working with Secretary Carson on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you believe the FHFA exceed its statutory authority as a conservator?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Maria, that's a nice try, but you know I'm not going to comment on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, let me -- let me switch gears, Secretary Mnuchin, because, obviously, this whole conversation of recession has -- has taken over. A lot of people worry that the jobs number on Friday showed a slowdown in the economy. Where are we on that? What can you tell us as we watch these numbers come in? And a lot of people are blaming the president's trade policy leading to uncertainty. And that is causing managers to sit on cash.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, there's no question there's a considerable slowdown in the world economy, both in China and in Europe. But as you look at the U.S., we continue to be the bright spot of growth.</p><p>I just came from the G7 with the president a few weeks ago, and that's what everybody was talking about, the president's economic plan of tax cuts, regulatory relief and trade are really what's driving the U.S. economy.</p><p>I don't see, in any way, a U.S. recession. I think if you look at interest rates, I think what you see is both in terms of long term interest rates, which are at a historic low, which is good for the economy, I think you see that on a relative basis we're still high relative to the rest of the world on interest rates, and you also see the market's expectation of the Fed doing rate cuts. So I don't, in any way, think that the yield curve reflects a recession. And as far as we see, very healthy, robust growth for the balance of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean I -- I know that the numbers are still showing growth. So the whole idea that we're going to be in a recession doesn't make a lot of sense to me either because you are seeing actual solid numbers in terms of growth.</p><p>But what can you say to investors and people out there who might be worried that the uncertainty around China, the uncertainty around this tariff situation is causing the economy to stall, even if it is the jewel of the world, and I get that. It is certainly the best story out there in the global economy.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, you know that the president is, you know, wants to deal with this very important issue of China trade. And we've been working on this for the last two and a half years. Since the first meeting we had with President Trump and President Xi, there was an agreement on both sides to rebalance the trading relationship so it was a fairer relationship. And Ambassador Lighthizer and I have been working very hard to get to that that result. And if we can get a good deal, which is our objective, we'll enter into a deal with China.</p><p>We have talks coming up on the vice minister level this month with them coming here and then with the vice premier coming here in the beginning of October. Our objective is to get a good deal. A deal that's good for American workers and American companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And you have been the front man, you and Bob Lighthizer, talking with the Chinese. So without giving anything away, because I know that you can't, do you think there's a willingness on that side to actually attack things, Secretary Mnuchin, that are the big ticket items?</p><p>I'm not talking about the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology. Isn't that the reason that they reneged back in April because they didn't want an enforcement mechanism in place that would have created consequences if they went back to their old ways of stealing.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, I think the talks broke down less about enforcement on -- and partially on other issues where there was significant pushback in China. I think the enforcement area, we at least have a conceptual -- an agreement on.</p><p>But, again, we have a document. We've made a lot of progress. They're coming here. I take that as a sign of good faith that they want to continue to negotiate. And we're prepared to negotiate. If we can get a good deal, a deal that's good for us, we'll sign it. If not, the president is perfectly fine with continuing the tariffs, which are raising significant amounts of money for the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is it fair to say it's impacted the Chinese economy, but it's also impacted the U.S. economy?</p><p>MNUCHIN: It's fair to say it's impacted the Chinese economy. We have not yet seen any impact on the U.S. economy. So I think, as you know, we've navigated this very carefully. There's no question that the RMB has depreciated significantly. That's paid for the majority of the tariffs.</p><p>I think there have been certain situations where there have been difficulties for companies and Ambassador Lighthizer has done a very good job managing the exception process on a case by case basis. So we have not seen an impact on the U.S. economy and we'll be very carefully managing that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you really say that even though we are seeing growth slow down because of uncertainty around trade? Can you really say it hasn't impacted the economy here?</p><p>MNUCHIN: Yes, I can really say that. And when you say growth has slowed down, you know, let me just comment that these numbers have volatility on the upside and the downside. There's no question that our growth is significantly higher than the rested of the world. There's no question that to a certain extent global growth will have a moderate impact on U.S. growth. But I -- I expect we're going to see a very robust finish of the year. And, as I said, no signs of a recession. The Trump economy -- the economic plan is working.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- well, will that include the end of the year USMCA? I mean, you know, the speaker has to bring it to the -- to the floor and a lot of people are worried that the U.S. worker is going to get -- going to get disadvantaged because Mexican workers make $1.50 an hour.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, we look forward. Congress is now coming back. That's no question about it. That's the top of our agenda. Ambassador Lighthizer is working very closely with the House. I've spoken to the speaker about this several times. And we look forward to working with her this month, hopefully to get to the point where they are comfortable in bringing this to the floor because I think if they do bring it to the floor it has the votes to pass.</p><p>And this is important for growth. We see a significant increase in growth in passing USMCA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's also growth questions around debt. One of the top stories in the business section of \"The Journal\" today, rising global debt helps keep rates low. That's going to cut into economic growth.</p><p>When does the $22 trillion, in terms of debt, become a real major problem? We've been talking all day about the Republicans getting religion on spending.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Well, Maria, we had a very modest increase in the budgets this year and next year in our two-year deal. The majority of that went to the military. I think you know that's an important item for the president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Mr. Secretary --</p><p>MNUCHIN: And --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, go ahead.</p><p>MNUCHIN: No, and just we're -- we're looking at debt to GDP and that's something we continue to monitor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Secretary, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate it. We will see you soon.</p><p>MNUCHIN: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary Mnuchin there. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump is headed to North Carolina for a big rally tonight. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Now, the President, Maria, going to be visiting the state ahead of tomorrow's special election to fill a House seat. The race is seen as a test to the President's own poll with voters. Analysts say that a republican defeat in North Carolina could suggest trouble for the President's reelection campaign. The district has been held by the GOP since 1963.</p><p>Well, there are some new developments to tell you about in the investigation into the deadly boat fire in Southern California. Federal authorities have searched the offices of the company that owned the scuba diving boat that was yesterday. Agents reportedly took pictures and carried out boxes. The diving boat caught fire in the middle of the night last week. It killed 34 people. Federal officials also searched the company's two remaining boats. One person is still missing from that tragedy.</p><p>Well, Facebook is denying any wrongdoing after Russia accused it allowing political advertisements during local elections over the weekend. The company says that any blame rests with advertisers who have to follow election laws. Russia bans political ads as voters go to the polls. Google was also accused of circulating political ads during the voting.</p><p>All right. Now, here is a kind of a joyous ending to tell you about. An elementary school student in Florida made fun of for wearing a homemade University of Tennessee T-shirt. Got the last laugh. The boy's teacher posted about it on Facebook, saying that he was bullied by girls at school over the shirt that he made for college color day. Well, the University of Tennessee responded. They turned the design into an official university shirt. With demands so high, it crashed, Maria, the school's Web site. Take that bullies everywhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Why would they make fun of him for making the T shirt in the first place? Kids can be so mean.</p><p>CASONE: Kids can be really, really mean.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't like it. All right, Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: But gee, that little boy can take pride and knowing that all those girls will be divorced and alone when they're 40.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Living at home. And you know what, you're going to be a shining star. You already are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He sure is already. All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, we are waiting on another I.G. report. House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins will join me later this hour. I'll get his take on the upcoming report. What will it say about FISA abuse. Then, tracking President Trump's Twitter feed, how J.P. Morgan's new index measures the impact of the president's tweets, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The Twitter effect, J.P. Morgan-Chase creating an index to measure how President Trump's tweets affect the market. It is called the \"Volfefe Index\" named after the president's covfefe comment. Joining us right now is J.P. Morgan private bank investment specialist Steven Rees. And Steven, it is great to have you on the program.</p><p>STEVEN REES, INVESTMENT SPECIALIST, J.P. MORGAN PRIVATE BANK: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, tell us about this Volfefe Index.</p><p>REES: You know, I learned about it last night, reading about it in the news, so I don't know much about it. But it's -- I'm sure it's just trying to track what's happening with all of the political tweets that we're seeing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But does it? I mean, does the President's tweets impact markets and tell me what value that has for investors? I mean, obviously, your firm is creating it, you're going to be -- you're going to be pushing it out there, right?</p><p>REES: Yes, I think more than the actual tweets, it's the perceived impact of policy changes that are impacting the market. So right now, it's all about the trade war. And it feels like trade discussions are back on. And that's why the market is moving higher. I mean, it's that simple. The economy is good, earnings are good. The valuation, I think -- I think it's fair. But if we're not going to get a trade deal, then I think the market is going lower. That means that -- it's that simple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's just -- it's totally about trade. It's totally about a China deal you're saying?</p><p>REES: In the short term, yes. Because I think if you get a deal, I think you're going to see the multiple rise on the S&amp;P 500, from perhaps 17 to 17-1/2, and I think that's going to take out some of the uncertainty around the earnings. I mean, the last guest was talking about no economic impact, we can debate that. We're starting to see a few companies talk about the uncertainty, we've heard from some technology companies. And I think over the next three to four weeks, when we hear the company's report, the third- quarter earnings season, all eyes are going to be on what is the impact of the trade war? Is it showing up in margins? And what does the outlook look like? So, yes, I do think it's all about trade in the short-term.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWCUS: Steven, another area that the President has been tweeting about is the Fed. And I'm curious, your reaction to what's ahead. I mean, everybody thinks 25 basis points or a quarter of a percentage point is baked in. But what beyond that, and what can we expect from a -- from a monetary policy perspective?</p><p>REES: Yes, I mean, the Fed has been the great saver this year in January, saying that they're going to step in and cut rates, and they've done just that. We expect a 25-basis-point cut this month, and probably one more before year end. But I think that's fully priced into the markets now. I don't see a lot of upside based on what the Fed is doing, but the good news is that they've said they're there to support. And I think that takes the recession risk off the table for now, which is a lot of people's concern at the end of last year, and even January before they came out and made that announcement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you advise clients if it's all about a Chinese trade deal?</p><p>REES: Yes, well, staying invested, for sure. I think there's a lot of hesitation wanting to sell because we're up 20 percent year-to-ate. So, getting them to stay invested, but thinking about making some smart rotation. So, taking profits in banks where the lower interest rates will have an impact and going into things like health care, which year-to-date has only up six to seven percent, so it's massive laggard, and it also tends to be a bit more defensive. We're also ...</p><p>MCDOWELL: With -- before you go on health care, is there, though, headline risk going under the election year next year? Because again, on the left, the proposals are so dramatic. Is that one reason you think there might have been underperformance?</p><p>REES: Yes, I think it's all the headline risk and the political uncertainty that's causing on performance. But going forward from here, I still think there's a great growth outlook for healthcare. So, becoming a bit more defensive, looking for income, we're investing a lot in infrastructure, you know, things that are less correlated to what's happening in China and what's happening in the overall economy, I think, are -- is the right way to position today. And we've also been adding gold, especially as it starts to pull back a bit I think below 1500 is a good level to add in portfolios.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tech seems to be rolling over a bit. And now, you got the state's launching the antitrust probes of Facebook and Google. Is that going to be a problem for investors in tech?</p><p>REES: I think in the short-term, any political headlines about breaking these companies up will pressure the multiples. But in reality, if you look at Tech overall, we're not at a bubble multiple. The valuations are still reasonable, the earnings growth is still good. The issue it's pulling back is the sector at large is up 32 percent year-to-date.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>REES: So, a lot of profits to take. And I think that's actually healthy. And I'd be buying that pullback if we see another five or six percent in the sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. When does the Volfefe Index start trading?</p><p>REES: You know, I've got to get to the office this morning to know more about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's just -- it's just to predict U.S. interest rates, it's Treasury rates. It's an -- it's like apparently that the number of market moving tweets has gone up a lot, using words like China, China and billion.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNER: China wasn't surprising to me. But it said billion. But the one that surprised me was --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: Exactly. I was like, isn't that in every other tweet that he has?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Democrats, Democrats was another key word.</p><p>CARTER: Well, there you go.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It's in every other tweet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching that. It's an interesting takeaway. Steven, it's great to see you.</p><p>REES: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.</p><p>REES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Steven Rees from J.P. Morgan. Breaking news, activist investor Elliott announcing a $3.2 billion stake in AT&amp;T, and outlining a plan to boost shares by over 65 percent. Elliott Management obviously a activist fund. Now in AT&amp;T sending a letter to the board. The stock is up almost eight percent on AT&amp;T. We're going to have you bring you live updates on this. And of course, we'll be watching AT&amp;T, it's going to be one of the big winners on the session on this Elliott Management stake.</p><p>Take a break, when we come back, eye on the I.G. report, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins joins me later this hour. His expectations on the next report coming out. And then, more trouble for Boeing to tell you about. The embattled aircraft manufacturer suspending tests on its new wide body jet after its doors reportedly exploded. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, September 9th, your top stories right now 8:33 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are higher this morning, take a look: Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading 58 points on the Dow Industrials. We are off of the highs of the morning, nonetheless the S&amp;P is up 10 and the NASDAQ is up 20, right now.</p><p>European indices, a different story. The FT-100 is negative. Britain's GDP report out this morning; it showed better-than-expected GDP growth. It was up three-tenths of a percent. Having said that, the Eurozone has had a tough time generating any growth. Germany reported that its exports were off seven-tenths of a percent in the month of July. DAX Index in Germany is up 48 points.</p><p>A different story in Japan, we saw the second quarter GDP out in Japan overnight. It slowed at a slower than expected pace but it was up 1.3 percent overnight. Asian markets finishing like this, as you can see, fractional loss in Hong Kong, the others are higher, with the Shanghai Composite up almost one percent.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning. AT&amp;T stock is soaring after Activist Investor Elliott Management, announced a $3-1/4-billion stake in AT&amp;T. Elliott Management sends a letter to the board, the plan, to boost shares according to Elliott is going to be far deep and the stock is up better than seven percent this morning. We will follow that one closely.</p><p>Back to work. Members of Congress returning to Washington today facing a big to-do list. All the hot-button issues on their plate coming up. And then, more trouble for Boeing. The company halting a stress test of its new 777X plane after the cargo doors failed. More details there. Boeing shares are down almost one percent this morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour, the Russia investigation, the inspector general report on FBI conduct, during the probe set to be released before end of the year. Some expecting it could lead to indictments. Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe talked to me about it yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We know that the I.G. has referred criminal action against Andrew McCabe and he's just got a job on, you know, another network.</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX): To remind viewers, it was last year that the inspector general found that Deputy Director McCabe authorized the disclosure of sensitive investigative information to a reporter. And then, more importantly, repeatedly lied about it the investigators. I think the Department of Justice, is going to have to indict Andy McCabe, simply because to do otherwise would be to admit that there are separate standards for the people doing the same thing, for the same conduct.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And joining me right now is House Judiciary Committee ranking member, he is Georgia Congressman Doug Collins. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): It's always good to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, you heard what John Ratcliffe just said and we did have a lot on the other side, Michael Flynn, Manafort -- anybody who lied to investigators, saw real accountability.</p><p>COLLINS: Yes, it's becoming an interesting issue, because you're seeing that what we saw was a, really, a vendetta -- it started about a corrupt (INAUDIBLE), McCabe, Strzok, Comey all of these. You know, and it's really interesting to me that how they went after the folks in the Trump administration, and we saw, you know, accountability as you just said.</p><p>And I think, what I'm looking at and others like John Ratcliffe and others are saying; it's time that we see in the FISA abuse issue. It's time that we see this with Mr. Durham. FISA should apply to everybody. This is something that I think most people forget.</p><p>They think this is -- unfortunately, it's become a partisan issue. No one should want Department of Justice to spy on anyone -- Democrat or Republican. This should be something, when you see the FISA process in which they're putting out documents, they're putting court documents with the FISA court, in which Comey even said were unverified, they were salacious but yet signed off on them. You know, again, it's become ridiculous especially what Comey says \"I was not a liar or leaker\" -- he's both.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, when would you expect FISA I.G. report to come out? Because we know that there was actual and we broke this story on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" and on this program, that there was exculpatory evidence that was not given to the FISA to the FISA court.</p><p>We had George Papadopoulos on this show. He told us the conversation he had with an informant where they said, oh, isn't this great that Russia has Hillary Clinton e-mails. This must be great for you. And he said no, it's not, that's treason. I would never do something like that. That transcripted conversation was never given to FISA court; that is called exculpatory evidence not being given to FISA court.</p><p>COLLINS: I think what we're going to be seeing now is Horowitz's reports hopefully is in the final stage; we know what it getting there, and getting ready to be classified. And there are a lot in this report that will be public, but there are a lot that will also be classified, because that's just the very nature of which it is. That will mean that members of Congress won't be able to see it all. So, I think we're going to see this push forward.</p><p>Bill Barr has been very consistent on what he has done. And I think that's something we have to consider here, and if as he's been very consistent, he's been forceful in saying: I want the Department of Justice what back to where the Department of Justice ought to be and not as a political vendetta system as what we saw under the Obama administration. They politicized the highest levels of the Department of Justice.</p><p>And remember, the one good thing that we can take from this, is those (INAUDIBLE). You know, they may be having careers now on networks, you know, lying at that point, but they are now gone from the Department of Justice and that's a good thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, but are we going to see accountability for that? I mean, John Ratcliffe came in the show yesterday and said: yes, the DOJ must indict Andrew McCabe because otherwise if you don't, it's two different standards. Do you think we're going to actually see indictments, prosecution?</p><p>COLLINS: I hope so. I think that's what, you know -- without putting words in anyone's mouth. And also, but I think, you know, Ratcliffe and I both agree that McCabe is one in which there's not a leg to stand on here. Whether you -- when you look at the standards, you look at what has been set forth with Flynn and others, there can't be two separate standards. Otherwise, American people who are just going to get up every day doing their normal job, saying: wait, something's not right here. I wouldn't be treated that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. All right, let me turn to this vote that's expected this week on impeachment. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee looking to vote on a resolution to formally define what Chairman Jerry Nadler has referred to as the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. They want to have a vote, is it a committee vote, on Wednesday?</p><p>COLLINS: They only have the committee -- this, frankly, the chairman this is sad. I mean, they've turned a very powerful committee into a sad shell of itself. In the last eight months, simply attacking the president, simply going after the things that they hate about this administration. And the reality is, what we're doing this week is unprecedented; they're definitely charting new ground in -- basically, in areas in which they shouldn't be.</p><p>These proceedings in a committee are simply designed to make people think they're doing more than what they are. They've been in August, they've been hearing from their liberal base, you know, you get the president, you got to start impeachment proceedings when they know that they don't have votes on the house.</p><p>All they know, and otherwise it would have started, Ms. Pelosi is not going to let, the Speaker is not going to let that. So, what he's doing is, let's have a show. I sort of describe this way, Maria, if your birthday on 15th, we're going to celebrate it, we forgot it, we're going to celebrate on the 18th and we buy you a bigger present to make it look more birthday- er. That is what we're doing here.</p><p>They're making a little more impeachment. But there's a problem, they filed court papers early this past month saying that they had procedures for grand jury information and others on how they can handle that. Yet, we're hearing that this -- frankly, in this resolution, they're putting, they're laying out the procedures that they would use. Maybe they need to pull back and apologize to the court or -- oops maybe we need to change what we're doing. So, this is just a farce as a show. We'll see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, in other words, they want to just keep talking about this so that the public thinks that there's actual meat on the bone.</p><p>COLLINS: They do. They just want to talk about it. I think, you know, it comes from the perspective of the chairman, I think, having deal with his own, you know, political processes up here in New York or whether it's primary issue, but also they have such a rabid base that refuses to see anything that the president has done. And all they want to do is undo the 2016 election. My question is when did the Judiciary Committee become a part of the (INAUDIBLE) of the DNC?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think this is so funny that you say that. I'm really glad you mentioned the primary challengers because Jerry Nadler has a primary challenger right now, and she's -- she seems actually very impressive, when you look at Lindsey Boylan, I believe is her name. And do you think that's what's pushing him to get so progressive, that he is afraid that he's going to actually get unseated?</p><p>COLLINS: I think he's pushing a lot of members in the Democratic Party right now. Because remember -- if you remember, let's go back and just do a little quick history, in June, just the chairman -- said that there was, you know, unavoidable evidence that the Mueller report was going to find that the president should be impeached. Did Mueller testify? Nothing happened.</p><p>Then, we saw in July -- I mean, in August, the chairman sends a letter to the other committee chairman saying, hey, you got anything we can do impeachment on. And now, we're coming back to do another show resolution that will only -- basically camp in the committee, not go to the House floor so that there are moderates and others who don't want to vote on this will be protected from that.</p><p>Again, I wish at a certain point in time we put aside the pretense. I've got no problem debating real ideas. If we want to have an immigration solution that actually solve our borders, took care for us, took care asylum, took care of the traffic -- those are things we put on the floor.</p><p>Instead, we're simply tagging along the American people and their base. I believe, at some point, their base is going to look and say they're not doing anything what they say; they're trying to fool us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So, what does the base want? By the way, did you know it was my birthday this week?</p><p>COLLINS: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. Because you just said my birthday. Because it's my birthday this week.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, happy birthday! (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So, what does base want to see from Congress now? You're back at work today, what are the priorities? Obviously, for Jerry Nadler, this is his priority. What are your priorities? What do you want to get done?</p><p>COLLINS: I think our priorities are this, looks it will continue what happened in the last 2-1/2 years. When we start looking at an economy that is doing well, when we start looking at the at Congress what happened two and a half years looking at economy that is doing well when we look at needs of that, then let's look at trade. Let's begin -- we have a Canada- Mexico trade agreement -- U.S. trade agreement that can be passed tomorrow -- Speaker Pelosi was only one.</p><p>If you're out here in Middle America, if you're out here working, getting up every morning not caring what goes on in D.C. but you know how to (INAUDIBLE), then you need to get on the phone and say speaker, put this to a vote, because it will pass easily in both the house and senate. They just don't want to give the president a win.</p><p>Then, you look at China, where there's issues that we can do in our committee on the intellectual property theft, intellectual privacy issues, working with tech. These are things that I think people relate to every day.</p><p>If we can actually work on those kinds of issues, those are the meat and potatoes issues that drive Americans to work every day. They look after themselves. We get lost in the D.C. sometimes thinking the world resolves around us. The reality is, the world is out there going to work every day caring about their children, caring about their families, and saying what does it matter to me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: See, that's one thing I think that people will react to if USMCA doesn't come to the floor. Because everyone, whether it's labor or business people believe that it's better than, than NAFTA. What about this story about U.S. states launching the anti-trust probes on tech companies: Facebook, Google?</p><p>What do you want to see in terms of big tech? Because this is just one issue, privacy issues -- and anti-trust being monopolistic issue, but there's also, you know, a censoring conservative conversation.</p><p>COLLINS: What we've got to do is actually get the folks in here and working on these big tech companies. Instead of going to what some of the liberals want to do (INAUDIBLE), let's just break them up, let's just, you know, have a government run -- we've got to actually sit down and have a real conversation and say OK, what is the privacy aspects here? What are the antitrust aspects? Are you dominating markets? We got to get people in, to our hearings instead of just having an easy answer and just saying everything is bad because they're big.</p><p>You say, look, what can we do to actually make this new economy work, and actually work for everyone, so we have more control.</p><p>For me, I put forward some taking points that said, let's look at a federal privacy act, so you actually control your data, that you're the one who's in control of it, instead of it being out there in the atmosphere of, the clouds so to speak with others control what your data looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you're making a really good point because people don't know when your data is being used at all. Congressman, thank you.</p><p>COLLINS: It's always good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you. Thanks to your leadership.</p><p>COLLINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Doug Collins, joining us there. Coming up, breaking news this morning out of AT&amp;T. Activist Hedge Fund Elliott Management announcing 3-1/4-billion-dollar stake in the company up. The stock is up, 7-1/3 percent. We've got the latest updates when we come back. Then, under pressure: Boeing halts tests of its new wide-body jet after the doors reportedly blew off during testing. Not good. Back in a minute.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAFAEL NADAL, PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER: Tennis is a very competitive sport. Mentally, you need to be strong every single day, and you need to have a spirit of trying to improve all the time because your rivals are improving.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that was U.S. Open winner Rafael Nadal after his emotional win last night. He spoke to FOX Business right after the win. It was an incredible match and we thank him for joining us.</p><p>Now this, a couple found a big surprise in their bank account. Get this, $120,000. So, what did they do? They spent it. Joining us right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Whoa, what a story, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, what would do you, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>VARNEY: I mean what would any of us do?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I said. Why did they do? They spent it.</p><p>VARNEY: You know, you would? Careful.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I might. I might.</p><p>VARNEY: OK. Hold on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, I'm not going to say I'm not going to say I'm not going to spend it. It's in my bank account. But, you know what, Stu, they knew that it shouldn't have been there.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was -- that --</p><p>VARNEY: That's the problem. So here's the story. There are a couple, they woke up one morning and found they got an extra 120,000 bucks in their bank account. They figured, \"What are we going to do with it?\" They decided they would spend it. In a couple of weeks, they bought -- let's see now. They bought a camper, a Chevy, a race car, and they gave 15,000 bucks to a group of friends, all well and good. Then the bank discovered its mistake, questioned them separately by the way, and apparently they realized that they shouldn't have spent it. And the bank is now charging them with three felony counts of receiving stolen property and charges of theft.</p><p>So, it brings up the question, what would any of us do if you found a ton of money. What should you do, well, report it to the authorities, I guess. What you should not do is spend it. Quite a story though, isn't it? When you think about it, what would we all do? Because this couple only had a thousand bucks in their account, and suddenly, they got an extra $120,000. It should happen to us all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, see, when you go -- when you start peeling back the onion and you realize they only had $1,000 to begin with --</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it was -- it's not like it's, \"Oh, well, wait, did I have this much or did I not have this much?\" But clearly, you see that it's a mistake, that's -- but three felonies? I don't know. Stu, I'm on the fence about this.</p><p>VARNEY: I agree. Think of the temptation to spend it and then think of the consequences --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: -- for spending it. I guess that's the equation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I guess so. But three felonies, OK. Wow. Stu, thank you. We will -- I know you'll have more in 10 minutes time.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, we will. A lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you then. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Join Stuart after this.</p><p>But first, we have breaking news this morning out of AT&amp;T, activist hedge fund Elliott Management announced a $3-1/4 billion stake in AT&amp;T. The stock is up almost seven percent. We're going to take you live to the trading floor, get a closer look at that and see what Elliott wants from AT&amp;T Management, how do they want the company changed.</p><p>Then under pressure, Boeing is halting tests of its wide-body jet after the doors reportedly blew off during testing. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Welcome back. We are watching shares of AT&amp;T this morning, jumping six percent after investor -- and it's an activist investor, Elliott Management, takes a $3.2 billion stake in the company. The stock is off of the highs this morning. Let's get to Kristina Partsinevelos on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where the action is happening. Good morning, Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. Yes, you have -- you have Elliott Management that also said that they believe the shares could increase to $60.00, which was contributing to that upsell this morning. The board, though, has weighed in on the Time Warner merger. We know that AT&amp;T bought Time Warner for $85 billion. The board still says at this point, it's too soon to tell whether AT&amp;T can create value with Time Warner.</p><p>And it's also recommended that a third party review AT&amp;T to look for some added growth opportunities. And switching gears, though, we talked about a stock that's up about six percent. Boeing, we're seeing Boeing down this morning and a lot of it has to do with a test of the 777X. This is a long- haul wide body plane. It failed its stress test. The stress test is used to check for heavy loads. Supposedly according to the Seattle Times, the cargo door actually blew out during the stress test. So, this is just another hiccup for the company, as many of the 737s, all the 737s are grounded. This is the Max 8 and so the company is trying to push out another long-haul wide body plane and clearly not doing so well. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Kristina. Thank you. Kristina Partsinevelos. Still ahead, we got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: We have some economic data coming out. We got Producer Price Index, CPI, and inflation, and also retail sales, and I'm looking at retail sales to see if the consumer is still strong because that's the thing that's driving our economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely. That's key. Lee.</p><p>CARTER: I'm looking forward to the Democrat debates this week. Thursday night. We're going to have a big night. You know, right now, if this were 2015, Trump would have run away. So, is Biden going to be the candidate? Is Elizabeth Warren going to continue to have her lead? Who is the Democratic Party going to decide they want to be? I think it's going to be interesting to watch.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are they going to try to take down Trump or take down each other on Thursday night?</p><p>CARTER: You know what?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: No, I think their whole thing has been about taking down Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: And I don't think it's a smart strategy because we don't know what they stand for. We know what they stand against.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. There you go.</p><p>CARTER: And being the party that stand against everything is not going to get us excited.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: They stand for reducing our quality of life and --in the United States because their climate change proposals, it's immoral.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Seven hours the other night on CNN. Have a great day, everybody. Let's get to \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: And I bet you didn't watch it all the way through.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019090903cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X14-H4Y1-JB20-G478-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8112\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001QYX</classCode><className>FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORP (FREDDIE MAC)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002RVS</classCode><className>FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (FANNIE MAE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DEWA</classCode><className>ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

Epic Games' answer? Suits filed against both companies describing each one's app store as anti-competitive and monopolistic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How the confrontation plays out has massive implications for how - and who - consumers pay for apps such as games and streaming entertainment. \"This is a big deal,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, in a note to investors. \"Epic is challenging Apple's (and Google's) pricing within their stores and offering an alternative for users to get the same thing at a lower price.\"</p><p>What is the argument?</p><p>Founded in 1991, Epic Games is well-known as the publisher of games such as Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade, as well as the Unreal Engine, which powers countless video games from Batman Arkham Asylum to Sea of Thieves.</p><p>Its free-to-play Fortnite, released in September 2017, has become a hit with 350 million players across multiple gaplatforms including video game consoles, PCs, and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. The game generated an estimated $2.4 billion in revenue in 2018 and $1.8 billion in 2019, according to SuperData, a Nielsen company.</p><p>Fortnite is free to play, but you can buy in-game currency called V-Bucks which is used to purchase weapons, customized outfits and dances, or emotes, for their in-game personas. When players on Apple and Android devices spend, Apple and Google get a 30% cut of those sales.</p><p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has argued that the online marketplaces that sell games - Apple's App Store, the Google Play store and Valve's PC game store Steam - take an unfair cut from game sales and in-game transactions.</p><p>Its new mobile payment system for Fortnite players on Android and iOS devices gives players a discount compared with buying through the Apple and Google apps. As of Thursday, players could choose to buy 1,000 V-Bucks directly from Epic Games for $7.99 - the same price as on PCs or home video game consoles. Through Apple's App Store and Google Play, the same purchase costs $9.99.</p><p>It's not Epic's first move against what it considers higher-than-suitable charges. In December 2018, Epic opened its own online PC game download store, charging game makers 12% for sales, to compete with Steam, which also charges a 30% cut on sales.</p><p>\"It's about economic efficiency when you have these stores sucking out a huge fraction of the profits from games,\" Sweeney told The Verge in April 2019. \"Valve, Apple, and Google make more profit through their storefront fees than the devs make off their own games.\"</p><p>Are app stores anti-competitive?</p><p>Not inherently. App stores serve as one-stop shopping for consumers for all kinds of applications including games. And the device you use allows you to make a choice on which marketplace to support.</p><p>Within the app stores, companies such as Apple and Google curate content and help connect game makers with consumers. \"There is value to that,\" Pachter says. \"Epic doesn't dispute the value, but thinks it's closer to 12% than to 30%.\"</p><p>Dan Niles, founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners, told CNBC that Apple deserves payment for access to its App Store. \"I mean, I have a lot of issues with Apple, but the charges they put on the App Store is not one of them,\" he said. \"I mean, at the end of the day, Epic Games chose to be on the platform; those were the terms. If they didn't want to do it, they didn't have to, and they get a lot of benefit from being able to access Apple's 1.5 billion devices globally.\"</p><p>Does this mean higher or lower prices?</p><p>That depends. If you are currently a Fortnite player on Android or iOS through Epic's payment method, you are getting lower prices with that 20% discount. And Epic's prices on consoles and PCs apparently seem reasonable to the millions who pay for V-Bucks on those platforms.</p><p>Developers such as Epic, the company argues in its suit against Apple, are forced to charge higher prices \"in order to pay Apple's app tax.\"</p><p>Breaking Apple's hold on distribution - and giving developers access to iPhones directly - would lead to to lower prices, says Sandeep Vaheesan, legal director of Open Markets Institute. Tying arrangements, such as software for devices, require consumers to pay for a product that could be priced higher simply because the party - in this case, Apple - has certain power and leverage in the market, he says.</p><p>\"When firms such as Apple dominate a market, they decide who participates and on what terms,\" he said in a statement. \"Epic's lawsuit is an important move against Apple's monopoly in the sale of iPhone apps. The federal judiciary must enforce existing antitrust prohibitions, including the categorical ban on tying by firms with power, and open the app market for iPhone owners and app developers.\"</p><p>But an open market could lead to consumers paying another way - with less secure and less reliable apps - argues tech consultant and business adviser Shelly Palmer in a blog post. Apple and Google created online malls and they \"rent space to 3rd parties. The price is 30% of your sales. For that 'fee,' you are given access to millions of potential customers. There is no version of a mobile Fortnite without the app stores,\" he said. \"The app store guidelines basically ensure a level of quality control for end users.\"</p><p>Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the newsletter Big Technology, told CNBC that Apple should back down, and lower Epic's fee. \"Rent collecting is bad for its business long term. So you have to decide as a business, do you want to make your money milking your asset or do you want to make your money innovating into the future?\"</p><p>In the end, whether prices go up or down will depend on how this standoff is resolved. Still, Pachter is doubtful that developers will reduce prices.</p><p>What happens when Fortnite gets an update later this month and current players cannot get the new content? Will their anger be directed at Apple and Google or Epic? And then, what will the response be?</p><p>When will this be resolved?</p><p>If the disputes play out in the courts, they could take a long time. The parties could come to a settlement.</p><p>And the threat of congressional regulation on big tech could be enough for Apple to submit.</p><p>Apple, in the past, has made deals. It reduced how its cut from 30% to 15% after Spotify subscribers' first year. Spotify filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the European Union last year, charging the \"Apple tax\" and other measures hamper its growth.</p><p>During the April-June quarter, Apple  reported revenue from Services, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, iTunes movie rentals and iCloud online storage, of $13.1 billion, up from $11.4 billion a year ago.</p><p>Epic, which is private, is braced for battle. Earlier this month, it got $1.78 billion in investments, including $250 million from Sony to acquire a minority interest in Epic, boosting the company's valuation to $17.3 billion.</p><p>The influx, Sweeney said in an announcement, \"accelerates Epic's efforts to build a new kind of digital ecosystem using real-time 3D technology, services that connect hundreds of millions of people, and a digital storefront that offers a fair business model.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-119020693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M9-K3D1-DYRR-94G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1242\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gannett Company, Inc.

I hope you had a wonderful holiday, and that the worst January start to the market in many long years hasn't put too much of a damper on it. But in all honesty, we've been expecting this kind of negativity for a little while. With the split between small- and large-cap stocks in the US continuing right through Christmas, eventually the large-cap-laden indices that the media follow blindly would eventually have to give. After all, most of the gains came from increases in multiples, not from underlying earnings. Whether this slide continues is the realm of market timers, not long-term fundamentals investors like us.</p><p><br/> That said, I can tell you that the small-cap shellacking an overreaction to $50 oil and the new year slump have conspired to\u00a0create some amazing deals in a handful of technology companies\u00a0most unfairly caught up in the market's mess. If your resolutions include beating the market, like mine (fingers crossed for the seventh straight year of it), then I suggest you\u00a0grab a risk-free trial to\u00a0Casey Extraordinary Technology[1]\u00a0to see just what I'm talking about. You can get instant access to our current list of best buys, some of which are trading at amazing values right now.<br/>The First Trillion-Dollar Company, and Other Bold Calls for the New Year<br/>Apple[2] (AAPL) becomes the first $1 trillion company,\u00a0predicts Doug Cass of Seabreeze Partners[3]. Apple[4]'s current market cap is $621 billion, so the trillion-dollar target implies a 61% increase in share price. The big move higher, according to Kass, will be fueled by analyst optimism ahead of the release of the next-generation iPhone. Kass sees the 2016 consensus earnings estimate rising from $8.60 to $10 per share. At $10 per share and a trillion-dollar market cap, Apple[5] would trade at around 17 times forward earnings. At $8.60 per share and a trillion-dollar market cap, Apple[6] would trade near 20 times forward earnings. Those aren't exactly ridiculous valuations, but they are a bit of a stretch for a company of Apple[7]'s size. I'd hate to be the last fool holding that hot potato when people realize the dividend would take 25 years to earn out that share price just to break even and no one is going to acquire a trillion-dollar company.<br/> Rising interest rates and falling oil price will bring tremendous stress to global capital markets,\u00a0says Fred Wilson, a high-profile venture capitalist[8]. So where should investors seek shelter? Not in your typical safe havens, claims Wilson: 'Safety used to mean gold, US treasuries, and blue chip stocks. Now it means Google[9], Apple[10], Amazon, and Facebook[11]'.<br/> Our take: First, low oil prices tend to mean\u00a0higher\u00a0equity prices outside that sector, though with energy an increasingly lower portion of variable costs for companies, we don't think the correlation will be all that high this latest round. Few actual experts are expecting rapidly rising rates in the US either. And while I have much respect for Mr. Wilson as a bar none VC, many a man has stepped out of his core market only to find himself clearly out of his depth. I'm very bullish on long-term technology, but falling oil prices mean little for Facebook[12] or any of its competitors. Let's pick those stocks for the right reasons: when they're growing revenues and earnings.<br/> It will be a banner year for Internet companies,\u00a0claims RBC Capital's Mark Maheney[13]. He cites several reasons why, including\u2026<br/> Mobile ad spending will start to catch up with the growth in mobile usage;<br/> With only 22% of the world's population on Facebook[14] and/or Twitter[15], the social media market is nowhere near saturation and will continue to experience significant growth;<br/> Ad budget dollars will continue to migrate from TV to online; and<br/> Huge cash balances held by large-cap Internet companies are apt to lead to mergers, acquisitions, and dividends.<br/> We often find ourselves at odds with Wall Street. But in this case, we agree with much of Maheney's thinking and foresee strong revenue and earnings growth for Internet companies in 2015. But tread carefully: many companies in this sector carry high valuations with anticipated growth already priced into their shares, including several ofRBC's top picks[16]. Therefore, stock picking (pairing good growth prospects with fair valuations) will be paramount to profiting from investment in the sector.<br/> In the November edition of\u00a0BIG TECH, we recommended a stock positioned to benefit from many of the market forces that Maheney identified, and priced at a price/earnings to growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1. Also, the company has a big catalyst on the horizon with the potential spinoff of one its high-profile subsidiaries, which would likely fetch a pretty penny if taken public. If that doesn't happen, this Internet company still has several solid cash-cow businesses to fall back on. A 50% return in the next 12 months could certainly be in the cards. For more information,\u00a0click here[17].<br/>Look Out, Cable: Here Comes Google[18] Fiber?<br/>Few would argue against Google[19] Fiber's big potential. After all, Fiber offers an average Internet speed 100 times faster than standard US connections. Also, it offers consumers an alternative to the likes of Comcast[20] and Time Warner[21], which\u00a0always top the list of America's most despised companies[22]. Unfortunately though, the Fiber rollout has been a slog. It was launched nearly four years ago and is currently only available in a few select cities. But that may soon change, thanks to regulation that could kick into effect this year.<br/> As you've probably heard, the FCC has proposed treating broadband Internet providers, such as Google[23], like telecoms. What would that mean? Greater oversight, for starters. Rates and service quality, for instance, would be regulated. And Google[24] would have to ask permission to discontinue some services. But the upside is that Google[25] would be allowed instant access to existing infrastructure, such as ducts, conduits, and utility poles, which are currently reserved for telecoms.<br/> 'Connecting homes via utility poles would cost Google[26] about a tenth as much as it spends to dig trenches and lay pipe for the service', says former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt. With the time and costs associated with deploying its fiber network potentially greatly reduced,\u00a0Google might ramp up the rollout[27]. That would be good news for millions of broadband subscribers\u2026 but the same can't be said for incumbent Internet service providers.<br/>Wearables Insanity Continues<br/>In a sign of things to come as unrealistic expectations mount for the wearables space, Under Armour[28], not content to be left behind by Nike's Fuel Band and other smart gadgets,\u00a0bought MapMyFitness and launched yet another fitness tracking app[29]. The company plans to follow up with gadgets to match from struggling phone maker HTC (which just posted its\u00a0first sales growth in three years[30]).<br/> These companies aren't alone with the new wearable gadgets. The dawn of yet another Consumer Electronics Show (which we'll summarize for you next week) has seen dozens of announcements in the space. After a weak reception for Google[31] Glass, traditional military equipment maker\u00a0ODG has decided to hop into the fray[32]\u00a0with its own Android augmented-reality headset (here's hoping it works as well as the one from\u00a0Daemon!). Intel[33], always one to push new form factors that no one adopts,\u00a0invested a cool $25 million in a smartglasses startup[34].<br/>Apple[35]'s even planning to push ads to your smartwatch as you walk down the street, with\u00a0plans leaked for a beacon that any retailer can buy[36]\u00a0to sense nearby devices and send ads to them. This market has been pushed along by researchers predicting these 'hyperlocal' ads to be a booming multibillion-dollar business in just a few years. Many of these are the same researchers who called for billions in home 3D printer sales by this year or next. We see the hyperlocal ads as a quick way to kill the market before it even gets started if they get pushed too hard.<br/> One cool use for wearables we have seen: car keys. Apparently,\u00a0Hyundai is going to allow you to unlock your car remotely using your smartwatch[37]. Granted, I haven't owned a car that required me to take my key out of my pocket in quite some years now, and I'm loath to wonder when hackers will use it to steal a whole lot's worth of cars in one go. Still, at least it's an app we can see people using.<br/> We're obviously very skeptical on this first generation of wearables. Few in the way of apps\u2014none with anything close to killer status\u2014probably means they'll go the way of the first desktops. Many early Apple[38]s sold only a few thousand devices, so maybe the Apple[39] of this generation has already arrived. But the same can be said of Tandy's and Commodore's early models, and you don't hear much from those companies any longer. The wearable might became the next desktop. In fact, we're betting on it long term. But in the next few years, we're likely to see a whole lot of failed efforts to break into to a market that just isn't ready for that kind of volume.<br/>Bits Bytes<br/>It's hardly a secret that big tech companies use fancy footwork to avoid onerous taxes.\u00a0The European Union intends to stop that.[40]\u00a0Under new rules, taxes on digital goods like apps, e-books, and MP3s will now be determined by where consumers live, rather than where the company selling these goods is headquartered. So an Amazon e-book, for example, sold in the UK will be taxed at 20% rather than the 3% rate in Luxembourg, which is where Amazon's European headquarters are located. The financial impact will be felt by consumers, producers, and perhaps most of all Luxembourg, home to Amazon, Microsoft[41], and Apple[42]'s digital operations. 'Luxembourg is going to lose an enormous amount of revenue,' said Karen Robb, a tax expert. 'There will be fewer compelling tax reasons for companies to stay in Luxembourg.'<br/> In 1995, Microsoft[43] launched Internet Explorer, and it became an instant hit. But the once beloved web browser has lost its luster in recent years. And now,\u00a0Internet Explorer is on its way out[44]. Later this year, Microsoft[45] will reportedly release a new web browser with Windows 10. It will likely be speedier and more secure than prior versions. It will also likely come with voice command capabilities and extensions. With the new and improved browser, Microsoft[46] is hoping to gain ground on Google[47]'s Chrome, which is the new top dog in the browser market, with 48% share.<br/> With the technology that the US military has at its disposal, it's not even a fair fight. Take\u00a0the new self-guiding bullets[48], created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. These bullets, called EXACTO, are equipped with sensors, internal electronic systems, and external fins that work together to guide the projectile toward a target, greatly increasing a sniper's accuracy. The concept is similar to laser-guided bombs that were first developed by the US at the height of the Vietnam War\u2026 just\u00a0much\u00a0smaller.<br/> China's air pollution is at alarming levels,\u00a0recently reaching 20 times the safe limit in northern parts of the country[49]. In response, the Chinese government is providing financial incentives for green technologies. In fact, China just announced hefty subsidies of up to $8,800 for buyers of electric cars.\u00a0But it only applies to cars manufactured in China[50], which means foreign electric carmakers like Tesla and Nissan are left out. China-based electric car company Kandi Technologies Group jumped on the news.<br/> In its continuing struggles to please regulators, Uber has seen\u00a0five of its six bases in New York City shut down[51]\u00a0for failure to submit trip records.<br/>Twitter[52] has its sights on YouTube,\u00a0launching a video upload service for shortish (up to 10 minutes) movies directly on its service[53]. No more than 140 characters for text still, though.<br/> BitTorrent's attempts to turn itself from a piracy hub to a commercial venture continue to make odd twists and turns. This time, it's in the form of a way to 'pay what you want[54]' for a movie. Who wants to bet most users pay $0.01? Though with Radiohead\u00a0apparently pulling in $20 million with BitTorrent's commerce tools[55], maybe I'm wrong to be skeptical.<br/>New York City is lifting the ban on cellphones in schools.[56]<br/> Despite evidence to the contrary,\u00a0the FBI still thinks North Korea hacked Sony Pictures[57], because they were apparently sophisticated enough to squeeze hundreds of gigabytes of data out of the company in a few weeks over the world's slowest internet connection, but too sloppy to cover up their IP address. They even\u00a0sanctioned an arms dealer (?)[58]\u00a0for it. Either way, one of the two administrations deserves a cut of that\u00a0$31 million Sony has made in streaming revenues[59]\u00a0so far.<br/> The FBI is arguing that its own form of hacking\u2014the false cell towers called 'stingrays' that intercept calls and identify users\u2014are\u00a0fine to use so long as they're set up outdoors[60]. Apparently they don't think you deserve privacy on a phone call if you're sitting in a park\u2026 or that wireless signals go through walls in people's homes.<br/> Who needs to hack? Apparently the UK's National Property Register was\u00a0happy to basically give away millions of records on who owns what around the country[61], along with lots of juicy personal details to make stealing said property as simple as possible.<br/> According to app tracker Flurry Insights, mobile app usage\u00a0jumped an astounding 76% last year[62], as the mobile web continues to become the mobile app store.<br/> Developers are beginning to realize\u00a0just how bad a business move putting yourself at the mercy of giant app stores[63]really is\u2014huge fees, one supplier of marketing push, and even a loss of contact information for customers.<br/> Next week we'll be back with a whole bunch from the Consumer Electronics Show and more, but until then, enjoy the future of the desktop computer:\u00a0the Intel Compute Stick[64]. The name needs some work, but this device\u2014reminiscent of the many streaming media players of the same form\u2014is a full-fledged PC\u2026 well, so long as you can live with a measly 32GB of storage, which is barely enough to hold the Windows or Linux version it will run on. Still, it's where we're headed, and it starts at $89:<br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/150108image1.jpg\">http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/ee-assets/channels/cdd_default/150108image1.jpg</url><br/> Now go off and have some fun playing one of the\u00a0thousands of old MS-DOS video games now available free on Internet Archive[65]. It won't be long before earnings season is back in full swing and you can't spare the time\u2014oh wait, that's probably just us.<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url

It is also a timely reminder to government that the power of the likes of Facebook and Google needs to be reined in. Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg are expected to deliver the government's response to Sims' Digital Platforms Inquiry by the end of the year.</p><p>The ACCC-led inquiry put Australia in the global spotlight. As countries across the world come to terms with the growth, dominance and broader consequences of Google and Facebook, the Australian regulator's 19-month investigation created the first draft blueprint for a potential wave of regulation across competition, consumer, privacy and merger laws.</p><p>The fact that the ACCC filed its court case before the government has given its full response would not have been lost on Sims, who has been vocal about pushing for tighter controls over Facebook and Google.</p><p>The crux of the ACCC's case is a claim that Android users did not realise a two-step process was needed to block Google from collecting their location data (where they went, how long they spent there, their place of \"work\" and \"home\"), from their smartphones. This involved disabling the location history as well as a second setting called \"Web and App Activity\". Sims argues that every person with an Android device has been misled by Google.</p><p>Unlike say, the ACCC's recent crack against internet service provider TPG, this particular case against Google seems intuitively more clear cut.</p><p>All the ACCC needs to do is show that the two-step process actually required on an Android phone to turn off Google tracking your location history was misleading. That's a pretty black and white thing to establish, no?</p><p>Not so fast, laughed one barrister, declining to be named due to client sensitivities.</p><p>\"Essentially, the idea here is that Google didn't disclose certain things to consumers, and that you had to turn off certain settings on your phone. But who knows? Google might go, 'no, no, we made that quite clear'.\"</p><p>The barrister, who has worked on many high profile consumer law cases, was at pains to point out that while this case does deal with this issue of how Google collects personal data, it's not a privacy law case.</p><p>\"It's a consumer law case about whether Google clearly notified consumers about how to use their product, and if they didn't, were they basically obtaining data from consumers without their informed consent or knowledge?\"</p><p>But consumer and privacy issues are increasingly linked in a world where trillions of data points are collected on individuals every day, and the corresponding data economy is ramping up.</p><p>Privacy is clearly an area where Sims wants to make his mark. The ACCC's inquiry recommended a massive overhaul of existing privacy legislation.</p><p>\"In the documents the ACCC has lodged with the court, they call it personal data. It seems the ACCC clearly thinks it's personal information,\" Holding Redlich partner Angela Flannery said.</p><p>The ACCC's concise statement of claim argues that the actual harm suffered by consumers here is that \"Google's conduct caused users to understand that personal data was not being obtained, retained, or used by Google when, in fact, personal data in relation to users' locations was being obtained and retained by Google for purposes other than use of Google services\".</p><p>One of those purposes is to suss out more about what people do and where they go to increase Google's ability to let advertisers serve up more targeted digital ads.</p><p>So sure, this is not a privacy law case. But that being said, the landmark case is the first time that Australian consumer laws have been used in this manner to pursue a large tech company.</p><p>Barrister Shane Prince SC said that Australia is a \"world leader\" in robust consumer law protections.</p><p>That robustness helps explain why we're seeing this particular legal approach for trying to ping Google on how it collects, stores and ultimately uses consumer data.</p><p>Prince said that consumer law cases in Australia have shifted from being less led by direct consumer complaints about misleading and deceptive conduct to the ACCC itself triaging priority areas and big policy questions to go after.</p><p>So perhaps this is not just a humdrum case about whether Android users were misled about turning off their location history after all.</p><p>Sims is wading into some pretty juicy international policy debates about how big tech operates. And he knows that people, both locally and internationally, are watching.AFR</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc77tsqaozp8hofge2emo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDY-00D1-JD34-V4KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"941\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

How's it going? It's the most wonderful time of the year: The last newsletter I'll have to write with you in 2015. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mike: Don't lie. You'll miss me when I go away on my vacation to Puerto Rico, which coincidentally is on the verge of a major bond default. I'm not sure what that means, but I think it has something to do with Daniel Craig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Anyway, we'll get through this together. While being apart, that is.</p><p>  Farhad: O.K., on to the week's tech -- actually, let's skip all that. Apple shuffled some executives around, California proposed rules for self-driving cars and Facebook and Uber hooked up, but for the most part nothing major happened this week.</p><p>  Instead, let's look at the whole year. What were the most important tech stories of 2015? The biggest news, by far, was the inauguration of this weekly newsletter, a development that rocked the tech world from San Francisco to South San Francisco.</p><p>  Mike: I recently showed my parents how to subscribe, mostly to convince them I have a real job and have done something with my life. So our audience is growing.</p><p>  Farhad: But enough about us. Let's talk about the tech bubble. Tech financing went a little nuts in the first half of the year. Hedge funds and mutual funds joined traditional tech venture capitalists in trying to get a stake in hot new companies, so a tsunami of money poured into start-ups. ''It might be the best time for any kind of business in any industry to raise money for all of history, like since the time of the ancient Egyptians,'' <person><nameText>Stewart Butterfield, </nameText></person>the co-founder of the business messaging company Slack, told me in April.</p><p>  Also, ''unicorns'' -- a term for tech companies valued at more than $1 billion -- became as common as mosquitoes. And with rising real estate costs and an invasion of tech bros, San Francisco became unbearable.</p><p>  Mike: Can I ask that we coin a new term besides ''unicorn'' in 2016? I was thinking something like, ''Liger.'' You know, the hybrid child of a tiger and a lion. Plus unlike unicorns, they actually exist!</p><p>  Also, to be fair to the tech bro wave, I will say that the bro has always existed in the wild, in his many forms, across many industries. As long as there are young people thrust into ridiculous amounts of money, whose egos exist unchecked amongst approving peers, there will be bros.</p><p>  Farhad: Good point, bro. But in the second of half of the year something suddenly shifted. Investors began to worry about ''exits'' -- tech companies weren't doing very well on the stock market, so how would all these start-ups ever get a big payday? A lot of firms also seemed to be spending way too much money; several were actually upside down on their unit costs, meaning they were spending more to serve each customer than they were making from them. And the mutual funds that had eagerly poured money into private tech companies began to ''mark down'' their investments -- that is, declaring them worth less than they'd paid for them.</p><p>  So that's the recap. But where do you think we are now? Are we headed for a huge blowup, or is it going to be the proverbial soft landing?</p><p>  Mike: I think if one continuously says, ''We're in a bubble and it's going to burst'' for years and years, they will eventually be proved right, but it doesn't really make them prescient. So I won't do that.</p><p>  What I do think will happen: A gradual slowdown in funding -- which in some areas is already occurring -- and a tightening of belts on some of the lavish start-up spending we've seen in recent years. Feelings of austerity tend to reverberate in cocoons like the technological one in which we exist.</p><p>  I'm not saying Dropbox and Pinterest will stop serving sushi tomorrow. A number of these companies are sitting on huge cash reserves, and may take years to go under or slowly fade away into acquisitions. The shift will be subtle, but notable.</p><p>  Farhad: In fact, I ate a delicious lunch at Dropbox just the other day. Grilled mahi-mahi, spinach salad, wheat berries -- it was a like a fancy restaurant. Based on the lunch, it's doing fine!</p><p>  Mike: That said, if you give out exorbitant sums of money to untested idealists for a long enough period of time, you will certainly see spectacular flameouts. Clinkle is a perfect example, as was the implosion of Fab. Evernote, Jawbone and others are on the watch list. There will be more. There will be blood.</p><p>  Farhad: Another big story in tech: This industry is terrible for women. That's not news, really -- it's been clear for years that the tech industry hires and promotes women at a far lower rate than men. But this year the problem finally got attention in the media and from some of the field's top execs. Ellen Pao, the former chief executive of Reddit -- itself a cesspool of misogyny -- sued the venture firm Kleiner Perkins for alleged gender discrimination during the years she worked there. Pao lost the case, but the lurid descriptions of sexism that surfaced during the trial cast an ugly light on the industry. So, do you think the case, or the attention, will change anything for women in tech?</p><p>  Mike: I think the Pao case, and subsequent fallout, certainly raised the profile of systemic and longstanding problems of gender and race discrimination in the Valley. That folks are discussing it more openly now is undoubtedly a good thing.</p><p>  But this stuff runs deep. There are many, many people in Silicon Valley who believe it is, and always should be, a pure meritocracy, where advancement is race- and gender-blind and should be judged solely on the quality of work. That sort of attitude, while not always professed in public, will take years to unravel. And I'm not sure that those currently in power see much incentive to make those sorts of changes, except for public relations purposes.</p><p>  Not to be a downer, but my outlook is not so good here for the short term. Maybe, just maybe, there's a chance in the long term for change if the issue isn't just a ''du jour'' menu item.</p><p>  Farhad: I guess I disagree, but only slightly. I think you're right that this should be a long-term commitment for tech companies. Talking to many of the big tech firms about this issue over the past year, I got a sense that they're not just paying lip service to diversity. But maybe I'm just easy to fool.</p><p>  Mike: I hope you're right! I really do.</p><p>  Last thing we should address: The inexorable rise of Uber, the ride-hailing company I seem to spend all my time covering. They're valued at $62.5 billion, have raised more than $10 billion, and seem to be taking over the world faster than Star Wars mania.</p><p>  And yet, I think the mainstream -- that is, those who are not insufferable coastal elitists like ourselves -- really have just begun to wake up to the phenomenon that is ride hailing. Sure, I may take an Uber from Manhattan home to Brooklyn at 2 a.m., but I doubt my folks in Fort Worth are doing the same thing. Also, they don't stay out that late.</p><p>  So what do you think hails for Uber in 2016? What's the next big challenge on their horizon?</p><p>  Farhad: There are two key questions, I think. The first is whether they can put a meaningful dent in car ownership and use. As they begin to expand services like UberPool, which allows multiple people to ride together at low prices, will they start to convince some people that getting around in Ubers is much cheaper than owning a car? If that happens -- and it seems possible in cities, but an open question in suburbs -- Uber could be far larger than it is now.</p><p>  The second question is whether the international expansion works. The company is spending huge amounts to replicate its success in the United States across the world, but it faces stiff competition and skeptical regulators. In 2016, we may begin to see signs that the expansion is panning out -- or whether it's a costly failure.</p><p>  But next year is still two weeks away. Until then, pal. Happy holidays!</p><p>  Mike: Same to you, sir! May our 2016 be filled with many more jocular exchanges and occasional insights.</p><p>  The Saturday tech newsletter will be on hiatus until Jan. 9.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's the week after Halloween, which means I've got Christmas music on repeat in my head, but I'm trying my hardest to tune it out by thinking of other terrible songs. I never knew I could mash up Burl Ives and Skrillex so seamlessly! </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Farhad: Wow, Mike, I had no idea you were so festive. I pictured you spending the holidays scowling at the tree, listening to nothing but 1990s grunge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mike: No, that's how I spend Easter.</p><p>  Get Ready for Waymo Robot Cars in Arizona</p><p>  Mike: Anyway, let's start with Waymo, the oddly named self-driving car offshoot that was spun out of Google, which is owned by Alphabet. (Ugh, what a mouthful.) Waymo had a milestone this week: The company has started testing self-driving cars on public roads in Arizona without human drivers behind the wheel, a significant milestone in the world of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>  Typically, self-driving cars have an engineer or some such person sitting in the driver's seat with hands hovering above the wheel, ready to take over at a moment's notice in case something goes wrong. That's how it was when I ''drove'' Uber's self-driving car last year, and that's pretty much the case for all other autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads.</p><p>  So even though it's only happening in Arizona, this is a big deal. Waymo is clearly leading the pack in the race to produce self-driving cars, which makes sense because of Google's multiyear head start in the space.</p><p>  Would you be comfortable being carted around in a self-driving car? I was, but perhaps I'm just used to it since it's one of the main topics I write about.</p><p>  Farhad: Because I live right near Waymo's headquarters, this is all old hat for me. I see the company's cars -- including the old panda-shaped ones that lack a steering wheel -- every morning during my commute. I'd have no problem riding in one, but I hope Arizonans know that it's very annoying to share the road with these robot cars.</p><p>  They're slow! They follow the speed limit, they take ages changing lanes and they have a frustrating habit of obeying every single rule of the road. Ugh, live a little, robot car -- STOP is just a suggestion, not some kind of law.</p><p>  Mike: Yes, well, don't throw away your driver's license quite yet. Or maybe do.</p><p>AT&amp;T's Megadeal Hits a Political Bump</p><p>  Mike: Moving on, a bigger piece of telecom and media news. This week, our DealBook team scooped that the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is pushing Time Warner and AT&amp;T to sell off Turner Broadcasting Company, which owns CNN, or DirecTV as a condition of a negotiated merger that has long been in the works.</p><p>  It's a huge ask, and hard to see how it's not politically motivated. As we all well know, President Trump is no fan of CNN. Also, I'm curious to know what legal grounds the D.O.J. would use to block a merger of this size.</p><p>  Farhad: The move makes for complicated politics. On the one hand, many liberals who are growing wary of ever-larger corporations might agree with the federal government putting stringent conditions on this deal. And yet it's hard to tell if these conditions are legitimate, or if they're being imposed to please a president who has repeatedly vowed to go after businesses that haven't toed his line.</p><p>  I wonder how this sort of thing affects liberals' efforts to police big tech. In a speech this week, Senator Al Franken called for greater regulations on tech giants. Trump has suggested some affinity for that stance; during the campaign, Trump often said that The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon's C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, was covering him critically because Amazon was worried that Trump would start antitrust proceedings against the company.</p><p>  Now, imagine if something like that happens -- would the left cheer Trump, or would they side with Amazon? I truly wonder.</p><p>  Mike: Right, well, we all saw how well the last huge Time Warner merger went, so let's hope this one goes better!</p><p>  Oh, I wanted to note a fantastic story from The New York Times Magazine this week, basically on the opacity of Facebook's algorithms and how its advertising can be so effective at targeting small groups of users that some start-ups are spending all their cash there and nowhere else. It's like Russia and the 2016 election, but for brands!</p><p>  Is Facebook Ruining Our Lives?</p><p>  Farhad: Speaking of Facebook, there was a startling admission this week by Sean Parker, the Napster co-founder and former Facebook executive (played by Justin Timberlake in ''The Social Network''). In an interview with Axios's Mike Allen, Parker said that he'd become a ''conscientious objector'' on social media, which he said had been built to addict us all.</p><p>  ''It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,'' he said. ''God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.''</p><p>  Watch for more of this. More and more people both in and out of Silicon Valley are worried about the long-term psychological effects of our digital age. I worry about you especially, Mike.</p><p>  Mike: Too busy looking at Twitter.</p><p>  Actually, the last thing I wanted to note: Will.i.am, the hip-hop artist and self-styled tech evangelist, has raised another $100 million in venture capital. He started on wearables and gadgets, and has pivoted to work on chatbots and devices like Amazon's Alexa and GoogleHome.</p><p>  So what do you think? Is Will.i.am the next Steve Jobs? Does raising venture capital actually require anything more than a hodgepodge of vague ideas and a series of pivots? What even is capitalism anymore?</p><p>  Farhad: I really don't get it. We live in a world where anyone who's made it constantly gets showered with more and more money regardless of whether they're doing anything useful. Mike, when do we get to cash in?</p><p>  Mike: Never. Anyway, see you next week!</p><p>  Farhad: Bye!</p><p>  Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.

It\u2019s the week after Halloween, which means I\u2019ve got Christmas music on repeat in my head, but I\u2019m trying my hardest to tune it out by thinking of other terrible songs. I never knew I could mash up Burl Ives and Skrillex so seamlessly!</p><p>Farhad: Wow, Mike, I had no idea you were so festive. I pictured you spending the holidays scowling at the tree, listening to nothing but 1990s grunge.</p><p>Mike: No, that\u2019s how I spend Easter.</p><p>Get Ready for Waymo Robot Cars in Arizona</p><p>Mike: Anyway, let\u2019s start with Waymo, the oddly named self-driving car offshoot that was spun out of Google, which is owned by Alphabet. (Ugh, what a mouthful.) Waymo had a milestone this week: The company has started testing self-driving cars on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/technology/waymo-autonomous-cars.html\">public roads in Arizona without human drivers behind the wheel,</url> a significant milestone in the world of autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Typically, self-driving cars have an engineer or some such person sitting in the driver\u2019s seat with hands hovering above the wheel, ready to take over at a moment\u2019s notice in case something goes wrong. That\u2019s how it was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/15/technology/our-reporter-goes-for-a-spin-in-a-self-driving-uber-car.html\">when I \u201cdrove\u201d Uber\u2019s self-driving car</url> last year, and that\u2019s pretty much the case for all other autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads.</p><p>So even though it\u2019s only happening in Arizona, this is a big deal. Waymo is clearly leading the pack in the race to produce self-driving cars, which makes sense because of Google\u2019s multiyear head start in the space.</p><p>Would you be comfortable being carted around in a self-driving car? I was, but perhaps I\u2019m just used to it since it\u2019s one of the main topics I write about.</p><p>Farhad: Because I live right near Waymo\u2019s headquarters, this is all old hat for me. I see the company\u2019s cars \u2014 including the old panda-shaped ones that lack a steering wheel \u2014 every morning during my commute. I\u2019d have no problem riding in one, but I hope Arizonans know that it\u2019s very annoying to share the road with these robot cars.</p><p>They\u2019re slow! They follow the speed limit, they take ages changing lanes and they have a frustrating habit of obeying every single rule of the road. Ugh, live a little, robot car \u2014 STOP is just a suggestion, not some kind of law.</p><p>Mike: Yes, well, don\u2019t throw away your driver\u2019s license quite yet. Or maybe do.</p><p>AT&amp;T\u2019s Megadeal Hits a Political Bump</p><p>Mike: Moving on, a bigger piece of telecom and media news. This week, our DealBook team scooped that the Department of Justice under the Trump administration is pushing Time Warner and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/dealbook/att-time-warner.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">AT&amp;T to sell off Turner Broadcasting Company, which owns CNN, or DirecTV</url> as a condition of a negotiated merger that has long been in the works.</p><p>It\u2019s a huge ask, and hard to see how it\u2019s not politically motivated. As we all well know, President Trump is no fan of CNN. Also, I\u2019m curious to know what legal grounds the D.O.J. would use to block a merger of this size.</p><p>Farhad: The move makes for complicated politics. On the one hand, many liberals who are growing wary of ever-larger corporations might agree with the federal government putting stringent conditions on this deal. And yet it\u2019s hard to tell if these conditions are legitimate, or if they\u2019re being imposed to please a president who has repeatedly vowed to go after businesses that haven\u2019t toed his line.</p><p>I wonder how this sort of thing affects liberals\u2019 efforts to police big tech. In a speech this week, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/09/tech-companies-pushed-for-net-neutrality-now-al-franken-wants-to-turn-it-on-them/?utm_term=.bd60579af430\">Senator Al Franken called for greater regulations on tech giants</url>. Trump has suggested some affinity for that stance; during the campaign, Trump often said that The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon\u2019s C.E.O., Jeff Bezos, was covering him critically because Amazon was worried that Trump would start antitrust proceedings against the company.</p><p>Now, imagine if something like that happens \u2014 would the left cheer Trump, or would they side with Amazon? I truly wonder.</p><p>Mike: Right, well, we all saw how well the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/business/media/11merger.html\">last huge Time Warner merger went</url>, so let\u2019s hope this one goes better!</p><p>Oh, I wanted to note a fantastic story from The New York Times Magazine this week, basically on the opacity of Facebook\u2019s algorithms and how its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/magazine/how-facebooks-oracular-algorithm-determines-the-fates-of-start-ups.html\">advertising can be so effective at targeting small groups of users</url> that some start-ups are spending all their cash there and nowhere else. It\u2019s like Russia and the 2016 election, but for brands!</p><p>Is Facebook Ruining Our Lives?</p><p>Farhad: Speaking of Facebook, there was a startling admission this week by Sean Parker, the Napster co-founder and former Facebook executive (played by Justin Timberlake in \u201cThe Social Network\u201d). In an interview with Axios\u2019s Mike Allen, Parker said that he\u2019d become a \u201cconscientious objector\u201d on social media, which he said had been built to addict us all.</p><p>\u201cIt probably interferes with productivity in weird ways,\u201d he said. \u201cGod only knows what it\u2019s doing to our children\u2019s brains.\u201d</p><p>Watch for more of this. More and more people both in and out of Silicon Valley are worried about the long-term psychological effects of our digital age. I worry about you especially, Mike.</p><p>Mike: Too busy looking at Twitter.</p><p>Actually, the last thing I wanted to note: Will.i.am, the hip-hop artist and self-styled tech evangelist, has raised another <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iam-enterprise/will-i-ams-startup-raises-117-million-enters-enterprise-market-idUSKBN1D62V4\">$100 million in venture capital.</url> He started on wearables and gadgets, and has pivoted to work on chatbots and devices like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Home.</p><p>So what do you think? Is Will.i.am the next Steve Jobs? Does raising venture capital actually require anything more than a hodgepodge of vague ideas and a series of pivots? What even is capitalism anymore?</p><p>Farhad: I really don\u2019t get it. We live in a world where anyone who\u2019s made it constantly gets showered with more and more money regardless of whether they\u2019re doing anything useful. Mike, when do we get to cash in?</p><p>Mike: Never. Anyway, see you next week!</p><p>Farhad: Bye!</p><p>Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called <url normalizedValue=\"http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=hdaNaYedr2/IomeWRKt0nffrak8aSGLbQgZx2X6d46QTPfqP1YU5VFs7ogbYiA6geS/dWohdr/Cx4ICfruKKr2z2ZEhwe2fcMtvfLej++g3+9LAF72/VBtXRkDTR4pF5CKttbwUssMU5HL2WJYI/0VrHruCF9eaWp6TWzwm3gY5CzzFgS+IzHQ35ZLqGbkhOIy6joka64CPPB2qO1CSxCws4wmpspc2uf1XJHkuwxgDLIWiA8c+LWEkF3bnkl/xJlpTsTR/vGcZUQKbgauwR11YKxEXdw77mpsL9Exh8G4GEGhospjNYEx0pWgmKbAhN2/H1m3RhoRLQ0Bm5yfyZ1Gchd1wJredFX+un1Z6FASCMiq/AiXqDUYmvXBW17bTVunJtZIT1fBdYX+lExCTQ7Q==&amp;campaign_id=688&amp;instance_id=104738&amp;segment_id=114617&amp;user_id=1ffefa416407390b81638ba7efba6875&amp;regi_id=71599530\">State of the Art</url>.

But with success has come a backlash, and then a backlash to the backlash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On paper, Buttigieg ticks a lot of presidential-candidate boxes; you can\u2019t write about Mayor Pete without mentioning he\u2019s a Rhodes scholar, he\u2019s a veteran, and he has an articulate, cool-tempered decency reminiscent of Barack Obama. And yet the mayor has drawn the ire of the plugged-in progressive left. There\u2019s something curious about the disdain, notes Derek Thompson in The Atlantic. In a field of many other milquetoast moderates \u2014 including front-runner Joe Biden \u2014 why has Mayor Pete been singled out for special skewering by young radicals?</p><p>I am not so young, but I am one of those crazy radicals who have been concerned about the intractable domination of our society by a small band of wealthy interests. So I\u2019ll tell you why I don\u2019t like Buttigieg. It\u2019s not because I think he\u2019d be an especially bad president. Like Biden, the mayor seems to possess the baseline capacity to run America in a way that isn\u2019t an embarrassment or a disgrace, which would certainly be a step up from the current administration. He has also articulated some interesting policy ideas, and he has managed to win a lot of hearts online \u2014 a talent, of a sort, in an election measured in cheesy viral hits.</p><p>Yet every time I hear him speak, I get the sense that he\u2019s trying too hard to please everyone and that \u2014 in a way that recalls some of Obama\u2019s worst tendencies toward misguided centrism \u2014 he\u2019ll end up pleasing no one in the process. Ultimately, I worry Buttigieg will easily lose to Trump because he is ill suited to make the simplest and most powerful argument against the current administration\u2019s apparent economic successes.</p><p>That argument goes like this Though the economic stats look pretty good, the Trump boom is a mirage and a moral disgrace. Today\u2019s seemingly rosy climate is the culmination of a political economy that consistently rewards the already wealthy at the expense of everyone else. The only way to reverse the trend toward inequality is to reform the way America does business. A politician who pushes for these reforms needs courage because the forces arrayed against structural change are powerful.</p><p>But while Mayor Pete has outlined several progressive-sounding ideas for overhauling Americans\u2019 economic lives \u2014 including a call for universal health care (that will still include a hefty role for private corporations), an idea for lowering student debt (but not making college free), a promise to strengthen regulations against monopolies (but a reluctance to break up Big Tech) \u2014 he lacks authenticity. Rather than fundamental reform, many of his proposals end up sounding like opportunistic incrementalism, as if he wants to be seen to be doing something without really doing much at all, for fear of arousing the forces arrayed against reform. Even Biden, who has built his brand on common-man folksisms, seems more believable, and he has explicitly promised billionaires that nothing much will change for them.</p><p>My fears about Mayor Pete\u2019s easy way with the wealthy were confirmed this week, when he convened a group of big-money donors on a tour through Silicon Valley. I wasn\u2019t surprised that he has proved so attractive to the tech set. With his slick, easy optimism, Mayor Pete reminds me of so many techies who promise big, disruptive change while refusing to accept the full costs of achieving their idealism. For them, there\u2019s always an easy, slapdash, cost-free revolution Just use the right hashtag on Instagram and you, too, can spark regime change in the Arab world.</p><p>I suspect we\u2019ll need a bolder candidate to take on Trumpism and corporate control. The Mayor from McKinsey is the wrong man to make the case.</p><p>The Democrat who meets Trump in 2020 will face a big challenge countering the idea that Trump\u2019s economic policies are \u201cworking,\u201d at least according to the traditional way we measure this stuff.</p><p>The American economy, we are told, is resplendent and aglow. Thanks to a tax cut that swelled corporate coffers and a frenzy of deregulation that unleashed long-term dangers in exchange for short-term profits, the hits just keep coming We\u2019re now in the longest expansion in history, with little sign of abating. Job growth regularly defies naysayers. The stock market seems to set a record more often than people stream Mariah Carey Christmas hits.</p><p>On CNBC the other day, anchor Jim Cramer, reflecting the mood of Wall Street, said, \u201cThese are the best numbers of our lives.\"</p><p>For the president, the political argument here is straightforward. Like Bill Clinton in 1996 or Ronald Reagan in 1984, Trump is planning to point to an economy doing its best George Costanza We\u2019re back, baby, we\u2019re back! Every week on Twitter, Trump chef-kisses new economic stats as if he\u2019d personally assembled the national dish.</p><p>That\u2019s one way to put it. Here\u2019s another way This economy is stupid.</p><p>As my colleague David Leonhardt writes, headline economic stats are increasingly divorced from more substantive metrics on American well-being. This is a country in which prosperity rains on the rich while hundreds of thousands of people go bankrupt every year for getting sick. This is a country in which it is not unusual to encounter developing-world misery alongside the most obscene collections of wealth ever recorded. There\u2019s a lot of job growth, but a lot of the jobs are low-wage, high-toil jobs. It\u2019s a country in which every nearly every economic sector trends toward monopoly and oligarchy, and in which regulators let companies call the shots \u2014 see the FAA and Boeing or the FTC and Google.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have turned these dismal realities into the central pillars of their campaigns. Both are calling for policies that fundamentally overhaul corporate control of the economy. As their detractors note, it\u2019s unlikely that they will be able to achieve many of those goals in our polarized political climate. But what matters to me is that they are making the case. They have articulated both far-reaching, structural policy goals and political strategies that mesh with the spirit of those goals. Not only are they calling for fundamental change that will alter vast sectors of the economy, but they are also committed to undoing the influence of corporations and the wealthy in their own path to the White House, underscoring their commitment to their goals.</p><p>I don\u2019t see how Mayor Pete can make a similarly compelling case. I don\u2019t see how he can take on Trump\u2019s economy without at least attempting to fight the CEOs who championed the corporate cash-grab that made it so hot. And I don\u2019t see how he can take on those CEOs while holding fundraisers in Napa Valley \u201cwine caves.\u201d</p><p>Mayor Pete seems like a lovely man. That\u2019s the problem. He\u2019ll get eaten alive by the corporate machine that now runs the world.</p><p>Farhad Manjoo is an opinion columnist for The New York Times with a background of reporting and writing about technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLTRIB-httpswwwsltribcomopinioncommentary20191218farhadmanjoodoyoung</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLTRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSG-7WJ1-JCB3-X2HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144579</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1200\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Salt Lake Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Salt Lake Tribune</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

This week, Farhad and Mike also talked with Nellie Bowles, who just joined The Times as a technology reporter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farhad: Good morning, Mike! I got back from vacation in Hawaii this past week. I ate at the famous doughnut place and passed out, and then I ate at that famous shave ice place and also passed out. I didn't have much poke, though. I bet you're disappointed in me. </p><p>  Mike: Honestly, I am disappointed in you, but not for the reasons you think. I'm mostly hurt you didn't bring me back a souvenir like I asked. Did I not specify 15 pounds of macadamia nuts?</p><p>  Farhad: Well, next time. Anyway, speaking of people who are disappointed in me, we have a special guest today -- Nellie Bowles, who just joined The Times to cover digital culture. Nellie, I'm thrilled you could chat with us today. Here is the basic drill: We go over the big tech news of the week, make fun of Mike, and then make fun of Mike some more. Sound good?</p><p>  Nellie: Hello, boys.</p><p>  Farhad: Great. O.K., here goes. So, let's start with Snap. Remember Snap? It made an app that teenagers really loved. They loved it so much people thought it would be the next Facebook. But yeah, no, that didn't happen. This week Snap's stock price plummeted after Morgan Stanley, the bank that led the company's recent I.P.O., issued a report downgrading the company's shares. Now Snap is trading under $17, its I.P.O. price.</p><p>  Mike: Talk about a knife in the back. Has Brian Nowak, the Morgan Stanley analyst who wrote the report, not heard of Snapchat's viral dancing hot dog? Billion-dollar idea right there.</p><p>  Farhad: What's ailing Snap? Facebook, obviously. The social giant has copied basically all of Snapchat's best features. Instagram, also owned by Facebook, seems to have kneecapped Snapchat's growth. Also, advertisers don't seem to be warming to Snap's platform.</p><p>  What can they do? Is Snap done?</p><p>  Mike: I don't think it's fair to count them out entirely. Snapchat still has a lot of highly engaged users who love the product, and the company is moving into augmented reality, via the aforementioned Mr. Hotdog.</p><p>  Nellie: People seem to have overestimated how loyal kids are to apps and how impactful stunts like Spectacles are. But mostly I think Snap out-cooled itself. They designed the app to be explained by word-of-mouth, so olds like me couldn't use it very easily. The only snap I've snapped was me asking if I was snapping. That said, it's worrisome how fast Facebook consumed this company, its last real social competition. And it's a reminder that we may still be seeing only the beginning of Facebook's reign.</p><p>  Mike: Honestly, I feel it's an issue of expectations. The bankers compared Snap to Facebook during the I.P.O. roadshow. But it's nowhere near the scale of Facebook, nor will it ever be. That was what Twitter's bankers did during its I.P.O., and look how well that worked for them in the long term.</p><p>  My advice, which I take to heart: Underpromise, overdeliver. Snapchat seemed to do the opposite.</p><p>  Farhad: In other news, the internet celebrated two big events this week. First, Prime Day. On this special day of grace, Peace Be Upon Jeff, we pledged our honor and devotion to Amazon. I picked up a few deals, and Amazon said it rang up huge sales of its Echo devices.</p><p>  Did you two find any bargains?</p><p>  Nellie: I did not.</p><p>  Mike: Um, yeah. I went a little wild and bought a printer and a PlayStation. Paper documents and killing bad guys are two very important things to me. Thankfully, I did not buy 100 knockoff iPhone cables like everyone else.</p><p>  Farhad: The day after Prime Day, in an odd bit of timing, the internet moved on to the ''Day of Action'' -- a huge online protest in opposition of the Federal Communication Commission's plan to undo so-called net neutrality regulations. Lots of internet companies altered their sites to show off the horrors they say will come when the government scraps rules meant to prevent broadband companies from blocking or throttling certain sites online. The protests were big, but from my view, they weren't really internet-stopping; I'd doubt if they changed much of the politics of the issue. Am I wrong?</p><p>  Nellie: Never thought I'd say this, but you're completely right. Net neutrality isn't a charismatic issue, and it's difficult to galvanize folks to march for internet speed. Net neutrality rules could be scrapped before most people know what they were in the first place.</p><p>  Mike: Where is John Oliver and his viral video team when you need him?</p><p>  I agree with Nellie, it seems like a done deal, and quite tough to get into the weeds with folks in a way that would make them care about the issue either way. . I guess it's time to prepare to watch Netflix originals with the spinning wheel of latency interrupting me every so often?</p><p>  That was fun! Welcome to the team, Nellie. I look forward to dunking on Farhad together for years to come.</p><p>  Nellie: I'm so excited to be joining the tech team!</p><p>  Farhad: I'm so excited to be done talking with Mike for the week. See ya!</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-656542170716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P1K-9JP1-JBG3-62RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"868\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/technology/farhads-and-mikes-and-nellies-week-in-tech-struggles-for-snap.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/15/technology/farhads-and-mikes-and-nellies-week-in-tech-struggles-for-snap.html</url><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 16, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They loved it so much people thought it would be the next <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/facebook-inc?inline=nyt-org\">Facebook</url>. But yeah, no, that didn\u2019t happen. This week Snap\u2019s stock price plummeted after Morgan Stanley, the bank that led the company\u2019s recent I.P.O., issued a report downgrading the company\u2019s shares. Now Snap is trading under $17, its I.P.O. price.</p><p>Mike: Talk about a knife in the back. Has Brian Nowak, the Morgan Stanley analyst who wrote the report, not heard of Snapchat\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/07/snapchat-dancing-hot-dog-filter-how-to-use.html\">viral dancing hot dog</url>? Billion-dollar idea right there.</p><p>Farhad: What\u2019s ailing Snap? Facebook, obviously. The social giant has copied basically all of Snapchat\u2019s best features. Instagram, also owned by Facebook, seems to have kneecapped Snapchat\u2019s growth. Also, advertisers don\u2019t seem to be warming to Snap\u2019s platform.</p><p>What can they do? Is Snap done?</p><p>Mike: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to count them out entirely. Snapchat still has a lot of highly engaged users who love the product, and the company is moving into augmented reality, via the aforementioned Mr. Hotdog.</p><p>Nellie: People seem to have overestimated how loyal kids are to apps and how impactful stunts like Spectacles are. But mostly I think Snap out-cooled itself. They designed the app to be explained by word-of-mouth, so olds like me couldn\u2019t use it very easily. The only snap I\u2019ve snapped was me asking if I was snapping. That said, it\u2019s worrisome how fast Facebook consumed this company, its last real social competition. And it\u2019s a reminder that we may still be seeing only the beginning of Facebook\u2019s reign.</p><p>Mike: Honestly, I feel it\u2019s an issue of expectations. The bankers compared Snap to Facebook during the I.P.O. roadshow. But it\u2019s nowhere near the scale of Facebook, nor will it ever be. That was what Twitter\u2019s bankers did during its I.P.O., and look how well that worked for them in the long term.</p><p>My advice, which I take to heart: Underpromise, overdeliver. Snapchat seemed to do the opposite.</p><p>Farhad: In other news, the internet celebrated two big events this week. First, Prime Day. On this special day of grace, Peace Be Upon Jeff, we pledged our honor and devotion to <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/amazoncom-inc?inline=nyt-org\">Amazon</url>. I picked up a few deals, and Amazon said it rang up huge sales of its Echo devices.</p><p>Did you two find any bargains?</p><p>Nellie: I did not.</p><p>Mike: Um, yeah. I went a little wild and bought a printer and a PlayStation. Paper documents and killing bad guys are two very important things to me. Thankfully, I did not buy 100 knockoff iPhone cables like everyone else.</p><p>Farhad: The day after Prime Day, in an odd bit of timing, the internet moved on to the \u201cDay of Action\u201d \u2014 a huge online protest in opposition of the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s plan to undo so-called <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/net_neutrality/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">net neutrality</url> regulations.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/technology/see-how-tech-companies-got-together-for-a-day-of-online-protest.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">Lots of internet companies altered their sites</url> to show off the horrors they say will come when the government scraps rules meant to prevent broadband companies from blocking or throttling certain sites online. The protests were big, but from my view, they weren\u2019t really internet-stopping; I\u2019d doubt if they changed much of the politics of the issue. Am I wrong?</p><p>Nellie: Never thought I\u2019d say this, but you\u2019re completely right. Net neutrality isn\u2019t a charismatic issue, and it\u2019s difficult to galvanize folks to march for internet speed. Net neutrality rules could be scrapped before most people know what they were in the first place.</p><p>Mike: Where is John Oliver and his viral video team when you need him?</p><p>I agree with Nellie, it seems like a done deal, and quite tough to get into the weeds with folks in a way that would make them care about the issue either way. . I guess it\u2019s time to prepare to watch Netflix originals with the spinning wheel of latency interrupting me every so often?</p><p>That was fun! Welcome to the team, Nellie. I look forward to dunking on Farhad together for years to come.</p><p>Nellie: I\u2019m so excited to be joining the tech team!</p><p>Farhad: I\u2019m so excited to be done talking with Mike for the week. See ya!</p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/technology/uber-chief-executive-officer-travis-kalanick.html\">Uber Offers a Thankless Job, and the Applications Flood In</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/technology/uber-russia-yandex.html\">Uber and Yandex, a Russian Ride-Hailing Rival, Opt to Share the Road</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/business/uber-drivers-class-action.html\">Uber Drivers Win Preliminary Class-Action Status in Labor Case</url></p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005265654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P1C-F0P1-DXY4-X28Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 15, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Snap Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Net Neutrality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Communications Commission</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>Snap Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Snap Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Snap Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Snap Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Communications Commission</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL3L</classCode><className>AUGMENTED REALITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000CZTI</classCode><className>STOCK PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS127</classCode><className>HAWAII, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

How was your week? I've been busy trying to get my digital life in order. For instance, I've decided to check my email just twice a day, and I'm carrying around my Kindle so that when I get the urge to check Twitter on my phone, I read a book instead. I have high hopes that it will make me fitter, happier and more productive. What do you think? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mike: Um, no wonder it's taking so long for you to respond to my emails. I'm going to start texting you my email threads instead. Prepare for a lot of chain letters.</p><p>GoogleMakes Another Big Smartphone Bet</p><p>  Farhad: Great. Well, let's talk tech. First, quickly: Googleis spending $1.1 billion to hire about 2,000 employees from HTC, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that has run into financial problems. Googleand HTC have long been partners -- HTC made Google's Pixel smartphone -- so this deal effectively creates a more tightly integrated team for building Google's hardware. And Googlehas bet big on hardware lately. On that note: Nest, one of Google's sister companies, unveiled a set of home security gadgets this week.</p><p>  I wish I had some sparkling insight to offer here to make sense of all this. Why is Google, which has repeatedly failed to make it big in hardware, spending so much to become a big player? But the answer is really straightforward: because it has the money, so why not? We're at that stage in the tech industry where every one of the five tech giants is doing everything, because their money is endless and their appetites are ferocious. There is not much more to it than that.</p><p>  Mike: I honestly am a bit confused here. Remember the Motorola debacle from a few years back? Googlepaid more than $12 billion to buy Motorola Mobility, another struggling handset maker, in an attempt to take on Apple more directly and own the hardware stack from top to bottom.</p><p>  That didn't work out so well. Googleended up selling Motorola for parts after it realized that, uh, no one wanted to buy Motorola phones.</p><p>  Some people are saying this is about gaining more expertise inside Googlefor building hardware. O.K., I guess. But let's hope it works out better than last time.</p><p>  Tough Week for Big Tech</p><p>  Farhad:  Let's turn to Apple, Facebook and Amazon, since they all had a rough week. For Apple, it was about a buggy smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is supposed to work on cellular networks, meaning it can reach the internet even if you're away from your phone. Our own reviewer, Brian X. Chen, found that it worked quite well, but reviewers at The Wall Street Journal and The Verge discovered a flaw in the devices that prevented them from reaching cellular networks in some instances. Apple said it would fix the bug in a software update, but it's still an embarrassing slip from a company that prides itself on getting things perfect.</p><p>  Mike:  Do we have to call this one ''Watchgate?'' I swear, every few iPhone launches we see some damning flaw in the hardware, and it takes a little shine off their huge annual product introductions.</p><p>  However, people will still buy their new iPhones in droves, as they always do. Probably the new watch, too. And to be fair to Apple, at least they aren't shipping phones that explode in your pants pocket.</p><p>  Farhad: Facebook, meanwhile, had to scramble to fix its ad targeting engine after ProPublica found that advertisers could use the system to target ads using racial slurs--for instance, people could show ads to ''Jew haters.'' Other reporters soon found that Google's and Twitter's ad systems could also be used to target heinous categories. Coming on top of reports that Russia used Facebook's ad system to manipulate the American election, the stories fed the perception that these companies just don't know how their systems are being used.</p><p>  Mike: And don't forget that Facebook finally came out with a nine-point list on how the company plans to comply with continuing investigations into Russian-linked ads and even begin some forms of self-regulation for political ads on Facebook. It's a huge story.</p><p>  Farhad: Oh, for further evidence of the cluelessness of tech companies over their platforms, Amazon's website has been recommending bomb-making materials to people, a British report found. Boy oh boy. Remember when tech was fun and zany, when it was all about getting cool gadgets? We're long past that.</p><p>  Mike: I started playing a video game the other day that's basically Grand Theft Auto meets San Francisco hackers. Part of the game includes making guns from a 3-D printer. The future is terrifying.</p><p>  A Tainted Image</p><p>  Farhad: The rapidly deteriorating image of tech companies is having real-world consequences. Our colleague Cecilia Kang reported that Facebook and Googlehave lost so much clout in Washington that they've all but given up trying to stop a sex-trafficking bill that they think could have negative consequences for their businesses. The bill would allow people to sue some websites for the content they host -- a huge change to existing law, which doesn't hold companies responsible for stuff their users post on their sites, as long as they work to take down illegal material.</p><p>  Internet giants were gearing up to fight the law, but they've determined that the growing anti-tech sentiment makes it too difficult. It's hard out there for a tech giant -- other than all those billions of dollars they keep raking in.</p><p>  Mike: Right, and I think tech companies have grown wise to where the tide is turning. Right now, we're seeing Facebook try to get ahead of Congress by announcing that it wants to essentially regulate its own political ads, largely because it doesn't want Congress to intervene. Also, I can only imagine that Google, Twitter and Amazon are bracing for the possibility of this story picking apart their businesses, too.</p><p>  In any case, the future is scary! Should we trust these tech companies that say they've got it covered, and have our best interests in hand?</p><p>  Farhad: Um ... probably not? O.K., see ya.</p><p>  Mike: Ta ta for now!</p><p>  Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter @fmanjoo and Mike Isaac @MikeIsaac.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-512435170923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ8-CY51-JBG3-63JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-a-very-bad-week-for-digital-giants.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-a-very-bad-week-for-digital-giants.html</url><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 23, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0003LCB</classCode><className>HTC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

How was your week? I\u2019ve been busy trying to get my digital life in order. For instance, I\u2019ve decided to check my email just twice a day, and I\u2019m carrying around my Kindle so that when I get the urge to check Twitter on my phone, I read a book instead. I have high hopes that it will make me fitter, happier and more productive. What do you think?</p><p>Mike: Um, no wonder it\u2019s taking so long for you to respond to my emails. I\u2019m going to start texting you my email threads instead. Prepare for a lot of chain letters.</p><p>Google Makes Another Big Smartphone Bet</p><p>Farhad: Great. Well, let\u2019s talk tech. First, quickly: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/google-htc-smartphones.html?_r=0\">Google is spending $1.1 billion to hire about 2,000 employees from HTC</url>, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that has run into financial problems. Google and HTC have long been partners \u2014 HTC made Google\u2019s Pixel smartphone \u2014 so this deal effectively creates a more tightly integrated team for building Google\u2019s hardware. And Google has bet big on hardware lately. On that note: Nest, one of Google\u2019s sister companies,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16337562/nest-secure-guard-detect-tag-alarm-home-security-system\">unveiled a set of home security gadgets this week</url>.</p><p>I wish I had some sparkling insight to offer here to make sense of all this. Why is Google, which has repeatedly failed to make it big in hardware, spending so much to become a big player? But the answer is really straightforward: because it has the money, so why not? We\u2019re at that stage in the tech industry where every one of the five tech giants is doing everything, because their money is endless and their appetites are ferocious. There is not much more to it than that.</p><p>Mike: I honestly am a bit confused here. Remember the Motorola debacle from a few years back? Google paid more than <url normalizedValue=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/google-to-buy-motorola-mobility/?mcubz=0&amp;_r=0\">$12 billion to buy Motorola Mobility</url>, another struggling handset maker, in an attempt to take on Apple more directly and own the hardware stack from top to bottom.</p><p>That didn\u2019t work out so well. Google ended up selling Motorola for parts after it realized that, uh, no one wanted to buy Motorola phones.</p><p>Some people are saying this is about gaining more expertise inside Google for building hardware. O.K., I guess. But let\u2019s hope it works out better than last time.</p><p>Tough Week for Big Tech</p><p>Farhad:  Let\u2019s turn to Apple, Facebook and Amazon, since they all had a rough week. For Apple, it was about a buggy smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is supposed to work on cellular networks, meaning it can reach the internet even if you\u2019re away from your phone. Our own reviewer, Brian X. Chen, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-series-3-review-cellular.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpersonaltech\">found that it worked quite well</url>, but reviewers at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-series-3-review-untethered-and-unreliable-1505905203\">The Wall Street Journal</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16334066/apple-watch-series-3-lte-new-features-review-2017\">The Verge</url> discovered a flaw in the devices that prevented them from reaching cellular networks in some instances. Apple said it would fix the bug in a software update, but it\u2019s still an embarrassing slip from a company that prides itself on getting things perfect.</p><p>Mike:  Do we have to call this one \u201cWatchgate?\u201d I swear, every few iPhone launches we see some damning flaw in the hardware, and it takes a little shine off their huge annual product introductions.</p><p>However, people will still buy their new iPhones in droves, as they always do. Probably the new watch, too. And to be fair to Apple, at least they aren\u2019t shipping phones that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/samsung-galaxy-note-7-battery-fires-report.html?mcubz=0\">explode in your pants</url> pocket.</p><p>Farhad: Facebook, meanwhile, had to scramble to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\">fix its ad targeting engine</url> after ProPublica found that advertisers could use the system to target ads using racial slurs\u2014for instance,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters\">people could show ads to \u201cJew haters.\u201d</url> Other reporters soon found that Google\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s ad systems could also be used to target heinous categories. Coming on top of reports that Russia used Facebook\u2019s ad system to manipulate the American election, the stories fed the perception that these companies just don\u2019t know how their systems are being used.</p><p>Mike: And don\u2019t forget that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/technology/facebook-russian-ads.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">Facebook finally came out with a nine-point list</url> on how the company plans to comply with continuing investigations into Russian-linked ads and even begin some forms of self-regulation for political ads on Facebook. It\u2019s a huge story.</p><p>Farhad: Oh, for further evidence of the cluelessness of tech companies over their platforms, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/uk-amazon-bomb.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">Amazon\u2019s website has been recommending bomb-making materials to people</url>, a British report found. Boy oh boy. Remember when tech was fun and zany, when it was all about getting cool gadgets? We\u2019re long past that.</p><p>Mike: I started playing a video game the other day that\u2019s basically Grand Theft Auto meets San Francisco hackers. Part of the game includes making guns from a 3-D printer. The future is terrifying.</p><p>A Tainted Image</p><p>Farhad: The rapidly deteriorating image of tech companies is having real-world consequences. Our colleague Cecilia Kang reported that Facebook and Google have lost so much clout in Washington that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/technology/internet-giants-face-new-political-resistance-in-washington.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=rank&amp;module=package&amp;version=highlights&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">they\u2019ve all but given up trying to stop a sex-trafficking bill</url> that they think could have negative consequences for their businesses. The bill would allow people to sue some websites for the content they host \u2014 a huge change to existing law, which doesn\u2019t hold companies responsible for stuff their users post on their sites, as long as they work to take down illegal material.</p><p>Internet giants were gearing up to fight the law, but they\u2019ve determined that the growing anti-tech sentiment makes it too difficult. It\u2019s hard out there for a tech giant \u2014 other than all those billions of dollars they keep raking in.</p><p>Mike: Right, and I think tech companies have grown wise to where the tide is turning. Right now, we\u2019re seeing Facebook try to get ahead of Congress by announcing that it wants to essentially regulate its own political ads, largely because it doesn\u2019t want Congress to intervene. Also, I can only imagine that Google, Twitter and Amazon are bracing for the possibility of this story picking apart their businesses, too.</p><p>In any case, the future is scary! Should we trust these tech companies that say they\u2019ve got it covered, and have our best interests in hand?</p><p>Farhad: Um \u2026 probably not? O.K., see ya.</p><p>Mike: Ta ta for now!</p><p>Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/fmanjoo\">@fmanjoo</url> and Mike Isaac       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac\">@MikeIsaac</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005451243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ8-90Y1-DXY4-X1NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 22, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HTC Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HTC Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HTC Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HTC Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HTC Corp</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon.com Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

I am particularly happy this morning because this weekend I am seeing ''Alien: Covenant.'' It's a film that combines nearly all of my passions: The vast expanse of space, the terror of murderous xenomorphs and the boyish good looks of <person><nameText>Michael Fassbender. </nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Farhad: Fun fact about me: Never seen an ''Alien'' movie.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mike: Wow, crazy. Well, they do say in Silicon Valley, no one can hear you scream.</p><p>  O.K., let's talk tech news. Earlier this week in transportation drama, I wrote a piece on how Waymo and Lyft -- two of Uber's largest competitors -- are collaborating in some sort of future self-driving car initiative. It will no doubt stoke all sorts of speculation that Waymo, the self-driving car arm spun out of Google, may one day decide to buy Lyft. Who knows if they actually produce anything from the partnership -- which is still light on detail -- but at the very least it's a big ding to Uber at a time the company is vulnerable to attack.</p><p>  Farhad: I know it's hard to love Uber, and also it's quite possible that Uber stole Google's self-driving tech (we'll find out as the big lawsuit proceeds). But to me, Google's actions here also deserve scrutiny.</p><p>  Look at all the sides Googleand its parent company, Alphabet, are playing in self-driving. Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Googleis running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber's biggest competitor.</p><p>  Isn't this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Googleis getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Googleis trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.</p><p>  Mike: It reminds me of how you act around the office.</p><p>  Anyway, in non-Uber news, Wired dropped a huge story on Apple's new campus, Apple Park, which basically looks like something out of a Kubrick film. My favorite follow-up story, however, came from The Outline, which had a source send them a pizza box from the company. Apple patented a circular pizza box that keeps pizza crispy and well-ventilated as employees walk from Apple's cafeterias back to their desks.</p><p>  This is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.</p><p>  Farhad: I don't care how much rounded glass Apple's HQ has, it won't beat working from home.</p><p>  Mike: Moving on, Instagram added face filters to its app, continuing its streak of innovatively finding new ways to rip off Snapchat for its product road map. Bravo.</p><p>Facebook had a series of embarrassing errors this week. After admitting it made its 10th mistake in advertising measurement, they had to pay back a bunch of the marketers who advertise through the platform. Nothing worse for a business than paying the people back who, um, are the ones paying you.</p><p>  Shortly after that, Facebook also was ordered to pay a $122 million fine to the European Union for making misleading statements regarding user privacy back when the company bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, for an obscene amount of money. Ouch.</p><p>  Since our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.</p><p>  Farhad: Not just Facebook, I imagine. As the world gets more and more worried about the size and power of Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, foreign regulators might become the most powerful checks on the tech giants. It will be an interesting fight to watch.</p><p>  Mike: I should note Google's slew of announcements at I/O, the company's annual conference for software developers. They basically do a gigantic news dump where they announce the latest in software updates, the status of Android, and the evolution of some of their latest initiatives like GoogleHome and GoogleAssistant.</p><p>  But to be honest with you, the Googlestuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.</p><p>  Nothing against Google, mind you. It's just difficult for me to concentrate on the slow dribble of tech news when the United States seems to be going through what amounts to the final season of ''Lost'' in front of our very eyes. I'm hoping that -- spoiler alert! -- we wake up at the end and realize it was all a hallucination directly preceding our untimely deaths. Or maybe something less grim.</p><p>  Farhad: Oh, yes. I went to Google's opening keynote and I thought there was actually a bunch of cool stuff there. But half the time I was glued to my phone for news of an impending constitutional crisis. It's hard to muster much interest in easier photo sharing when your entire photo deck is full of screenshots of crazy headlines.</p><p>  Mike: Just look at our front page on any given day. Or, heck, turn on literally any form of electronic communication around 6 p.m. each day and watch a shotgun blast of political news dumps drop.</p><p>  This week was the continuing saga with former F.B.I. director James Comey, the investigation into Russia's possible collusion with Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election, and the latest on Michael Flynn, the disgraced National Security Advisor. And that was just Monday!</p><p>  How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.</p><p>  Farhad: It's an interesting question -- and as someone who's usually hooked to both politics news and tech news, I've been feeling this tug. On the one hand really nothing in tech seems like it's that interesting at the moment. It's not just that national headlines are eating up all my brainspace; it's also that so much of what's interesting in tech, these days, is pretty speculative.</p><p>  Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.</p><p>  We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.</p><p>  One thing I've found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they're working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.</p><p>  Mike: Maybe, but we still have to talk to each other every week.</p><p>  Farhad: Oh man, you're right. Maybe it doesn't get better after all.</p><p>  Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter @fmanjoo and Mike Isaac @MikeIsaac.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-175196170521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NKM-Y6M1-DXY4-X1B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1229\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-caring-about-tech-news.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/technology/farhads-and-mikes-week-in-tech-caring-about-tech-news.html</url><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 21, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They basically do a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654432/google-io-2017-keynote-highlights-news-announcements-recap\">gigantic news dump</url> where they announce the latest in software updates, the status of Android, and the evolution of some of their latest initiatives like Google Home and Google Assistant.</p><p>But to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.</p><p>Nothing against Google, mind you. It\u2019s just difficult for me to concentrate on the slow dribble of tech news when the United States seems to be going through what amounts to <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)\">the final season of \u201cLost\u201d</url> in front of our very eyes. I\u2019m hoping that \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 we wake up at the end and realize it was all a hallucination directly preceding our untimely deaths. Or maybe something less grim.</p><p>Farhad: Oh, yes. I went to Google\u2019s opening keynote and I thought there was actually a bunch of cool stuff there. But half the time I was glued to my phone for news of an impending constitutional crisis. It\u2019s hard to muster much interest in easier photo sharing when your entire photo deck is full of screenshots of crazy headlines.</p><p>Mike: Just look at our front page on any given day. Or, heck, turn on literally any form of electronic communication around 6 p.m. each day and watch a shotgun blast of political news dumps drop.</p><p>This week was the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/us/politics/james-comey-memo-fbi-trump.html?ref=politics\">continuing saga with former F.B.I. director James Comey</url>, the investigation into Russia\u2019s possible collusion with Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election, and the latest on Michael Flynn, the disgraced National Security Advisor. And that was just Monday!</p><p>How do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.</p><p>Farhad: It\u2019s an interesting question \u2014 and as someone who\u2019s usually hooked to both politics news and tech news, I\u2019ve been feeling this tug. On the one hand really nothing in tech seems like it\u2019s that interesting at the moment. It\u2019s not just that national headlines are eating up all my brainspace; it\u2019s also that so much of what\u2019s interesting in tech, these days, is pretty speculative.</p><p>Self-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.</p><p>We might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.</p><p>One thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.</p><p>Mike: Maybe, but we still have to talk to each other every week.</p><p>Farhad: Oh man, you\u2019re right. Maybe it doesn\u2019t get better after all.</p><p>Follow Farhad Manjoo on Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/fmanjoo\">@fmanjoo</url> and Mike Isaac       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac\">@MikeIsaac</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000005117519</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NKF-2NV1-JBG3-62H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1217\"/><timeReceived>00:00 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 20, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Driverless and Semiautonomous Vehicles</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers and the Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mobile Applications</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Advertising and Marketing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust Laws and Competition Issues</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Uber Technologies Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lyft Inc</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Uber Technologies Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Alphabet Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Uber Technologies Inc</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lyft Inc</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning! Let's talk tech. </p><p>NetflixKeeps Growing</p><p>  People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflixwas growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It's even faster.</p><p>  The company reported this week that it had added 8.3 million subscribers in the last quarter, about two million more than analysts were expecting. But it's still spending tons of money on content -- about $8 billion this year, and perhaps more in future years. Many in the industry continue to wonder whether the company's business will ever work.</p><p>  The problem: To start making money, Netflixmight eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?</p><p>  Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix's earnings report. Netflixraised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.</p><p>  I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there's just so much stuff on Netflix-- so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies -- it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it's indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.</p><p>  A Smart, if Tardy, Speaker</p><p>  Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon's Echo and <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.</p><p>  Then, nothing.</p><p>  A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn't come until after the holidays.</p><p>  It was a crucial miss -- the Echo seems to have had a gangbusters holiday, with Amazon expanding its head start in the category by probably tens of millions of devices. In a widely passed-around post, the venture capitalist M. G. Siegler wondered whether Amazon was so far ahead that HomePod was essentially dead on arrival.</p><p>  Well, we'll see. Apple announced this week that HomePod was back in action -- available to order on Friday, and in stores starting Feb. 9.</p><p>  It's still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.</p><p>  Democrats vs. Silicon Valley</p><p>  My colleagues Cecilia Kang and Daisuke Wakabayashi had an interesting article this week about the growing tensions between the tech industry and the Democratic Party. Democrats and techies have long been reliable allies -- techies donate tons of money, and Democratic candidates get to show off their association with widely admired visionaries of the future.</p><p>  That's past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising -- a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.</p><p>  There's another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they're all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry's leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.</p><p>  It's an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.</p><p>  Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.

Let\u2019s talk tech.</p><p>Netflix Keeps Growing</p><p>People on Wall Street thought they knew how fast Netflix was growing. Very fast, they thought. It turns out they were wrong: It\u2019s even faster.</p><p>The company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/netflix-earnings-q4-2017.html\">reported this week</url> that it had added 8.3 million subscribers in the last quarter, about two million more than analysts were expecting. But it\u2019s still spending tons of money on content \u2014 about $8 billion this year, and perhaps more in future years. Many in the industry continue to wonder whether the company\u2019s business will ever work.</p><p>The problem: To start making money, Netflix might eventually have to raise prices a lot. What will happen then?</p><p>Well, we learned something interesting in Netflix\u2019s earnings report. Netflix raised the prices of some its plans over the last quarter, and people still signed up.</p><p>I suspect that accounts for how the service is changing. Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.</p><p>A Smart, if Tardy, Speaker</p><p>Remember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.</p><p>Then, nothing.</p><p>A new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.</p><p>It was a crucial miss \u2014 the Echo seems to have had a gangbusters holiday, with Amazon expanding its head start in the category by probably tens of millions of devices. In a widely passed-around post, <url normalizedValue=\"https://500ish.com/alexa-everywhere-eeee670a5f02\">the venture capitalist M. G. Siegler wondered</url> whether Amazon was so far ahead that HomePod was essentially dead on arrival.</p><p>Well, we\u2019ll see. Apple announced this week that HomePod was back in action \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/homepod-arrives-february-9-available-to-order-this-friday/\">available to order on Friday</url>, and in stores starting Feb. 9.</p><p>It\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.</p><p>Democrats vs. Silicon Valley</p><p>My colleagues Cecilia Kang and Daisuke Wakabayashi had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/technology/democrats-silicon-valley.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=technology&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=10&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\">an interesting article</url> this week about the growing tensions between the tech industry and the Democratic Party. Democrats and techies have long been reliable allies \u2014 techies donate tons of money, and Democratic candidates get to show off their association with widely admired visionaries of the future.</p><p>That\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.</p><p>There\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.</p><p>It\u2019s an election year. It will be interesting to see whether Democrats run against tech, whether tech sticks with Dems and, always, what Trump does with all this.</p><p>Farhad Manjoo writes a weekly technology column called State of the Art.

In a phone interview, FBN cofounder and CEO Amol Deshpande described the new business as a way to help reward farmers for their efforts as environmental stewards. The San Carlos, California-based company plans to announce the spinout later today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farmers deserve more opportunities to be recognized for sustainable practices,  Deshpande, 42, says.  The extra incomes and premiums could be the difference between running a profitable business and losing money. </p><p>That s especially true these days as the economic downturn has squeezed family farms. Corn prices have fallen to $3.50 a bushel or less, while the prices of seeds and other inputs, like fertilizer and pesticide, have not dropped.</p><p>Devin Lammers, FBN s president of crop marketing and financial services, who helped to create and launch the new business, will serve as GRO s president and interim CEO. The new venture will ultimately bring in a new CEO.  Agriculture can be a solution to the climate challenges we face today,  says Lammers, who grew up on a bison ranch in South Dakota.  Consumers are looking for sustainability in all the products they buy. </p><p>Supply-chain issues in agriculture are extraordinarily complex. In major crops like corn and soy, farmers generally drop off their grains at depots that don t distinguish between those that have been grown using a lot of chemicals versus those that have been grown using more environmentally friendly farming practices. For farmers, worried about yield of their crops during tough times that makes switching tacks a risky choice as it could depress yield or squeeze already-thin profit margins. FBN, whose entire business is based on data and loads of it, had long discussed how its data might help farmers make   and be paid for making   more sustainable decisions.</p><p>Since its 2014 founding, Farmers Business Network has grown from a small data provider to farmers to one of the largest venture-backed agtech startups, worth a reported $1.75 billion at<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>latest fundraise,</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>of some $250 million led by BlackRock, in August.

But it has also struggled as the large name-brand seed producers have refused to sell through its digital store.

One method of carbon scoring that GRO uses is based on a model developed by Argonne National Labs, but it expects that different customers will choose among a variety of models.  The score is associated with a bushel of grain from that farm,  says Lammers.  We are building the technology, and have built much of it already, that will preserve the information as it moves through the value chain. </p><p>Matt Alford, who farms some 1,300 acres of corn and soy in southern Minnesota, is among those who signed up for the pilot projects and plans to work with GRO Network.  Part of my frustration with the current farm system is there is no incentive to do things the quote-unquote right way or environmentally sound way,  he says. While Alford, who is 32, changed his own farming practices, to use less fertilizer and to do strip tillage, which leaves the majority of land undisturbed, he wasn t able to be paid more for those choices when he brought his grain to the local elevator.  I haul my grain to the same places everyone else does even though I more than likely am using less fertilizer, my ground has less erosion and I am releasing less CO2 into the atmosphere due to my farming practices,  he says. With GRO s incentives, he hopes that will change   and will also spur other farmers to think differently about the risk-reward of chasing yield.</p><p>Biofuels giant POET, based in Sioux Falls, Dakota (where FBN has an outpost), was one of the project s earliest customers. It began working with FBN on a pilot project in South Dakota more than a year ago that helped the two determine that GRO Network could work. POET bought a total of 8 million bushels of corn from farmers through the FBN program that scored farm practices. Now it s gearing up for what both hope will be a larger effort with GRO.  Many states could adopt low-carbon fuel standards to create even lower carbon biofuels,  says POET founder and CEO Jeff Broin.  We re all looking for solutions to make a significant impact on climate change, and this is a very exciting program for that. </p><p>California s policy on low-carbon fuel has pushed cleaner liquid fuels, but the program currently scores all grain inputs for biodiesel, ethanol and the like the same. FBN is pushing to get scoring of grains included in the calculations, which would give a regulatory push to its work and a method of incentivizing farmers financially for making better environmental choices. Steele Lorenz, FBN s head of sustainable business, says the company hopes to get the sign-off from regulators in 2021 for use in 2022.  It is a natural extension of what the intent of the policy is now, made possible by technology,  says Lorenz, noting that Oregon also has a low-carbon fuel policy and other states, including Minnesota and Washington, are considering them.</p><p>In the pilot project in South Dakota, farmers got approximately 22 cents premium per bushel of corn, Lorenz says, a big bonus at a time when corn prices are around $3.50 per bushel. FBN expects that farmers would get around 10 cents per bushel extra over time, a still substantial amount at a time of low commodity prices. For markets other than biofuels, such as consumer products or animal feed, the premiums will vary based on the customer and market demand. GRO Network will generally take a small cut of the premium for its role in doing the carbon scoring and tracking the low-carbon grain.</p><p> We want to create an opportunity for farmers to participate in all this interest that consumers and corporate America has in sustainability,  Deshpande says.  Farmers are very critical environmental stewards. It s really key that we find a way to recognize their efforts. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-content_5f44420e9f586d000616aa4d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RH-J7N1-DXVP-50NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1369\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In a phone interview, FBN cofounder and CEO Amol Deshpande described the new business as a way to help reward farmers for their efforts as environmental stewards. The San Carlos, California-based company plans to announce the spinout later today.    \u201cFarmers deserve more opportunities to be recognized for sustainable practices,\u201d Deshpande, 42, says. \u201cThe extra incomes and premiums could be the difference between running a profitable business and losing money.\u201d    That\u2019s especially true these days as the economic downturn has squeezed family farms. Corn prices have fallen to $3.50 a bushel or less, while the prices of seeds and other inputs, like fertilizer and pesticide, have not dropped.     Devin Lammers, FBN\u2019s president of crop marketing and financial services, who helped to create and launch the new business, will serve as GRO\u2019s president and interim CEO. The new venture will ultimately bring in a new CEO. \u201cAgriculture can be a solution to the climate challenges we face today,\u201d says Lammers, who grew up on a bison ranch in South Dakota. \u201cConsumers are looking for sustainability in all the products they buy.\u201d    Supply-chain issues in agriculture are extraordinarily complex. In major crops like corn and soy, farmers generally drop off their grains at depots that don\u2019t distinguish between those that have been grown using a lot of chemicals versus those that have been grown using more environmentally friendly farming practices. For farmers, worried about yield of their crops during tough times that makes switching tacks a risky choice as it could depress yield or squeeze already-thin profit margins. FBN, whose entire business is based on data and loads of it, had long discussed how its data might help farmers make \u2014 and be paid for making \u2014 more sustainable decisions.    Since its 2014 founding, Farmers Business Network has grown from a small data provider to farmers to one of the largest venture-backed agtech startups, worth a reported $1.75 billion at latest fundraise, of some $250 million led by BlackRock, in August. FBN\u2019s 14,000 members farm some 40 million acres in the U.S. and Canada. It was on track for $200 million in revenue in 2018 when we wrote a magazine feature on on the company ; Deshpande declined to disclose an updated revenue figure.    It has battled against the large agricultural players, positioning itself as an upstart working on behalf of farmers against an entrenched system with transparent pricing. But it has also struggled as the large name-brand seed producers have refused to sell through its digital store. After FBN purchased a Canadian distributor, major suppliers including Bayer, Corteva and Cargill stopped selling to it, leading to a civil investigation by Canada\u2019s Competition Bureau and, even catching the eye of the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust division, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe tech industry is helpful to the consumer compared to the ag industry,\u201d rails Deshpande. \u201cI was like, \u2018My god, I understand everyone is mad at these big tech companies, but you should see how these big ag companies behave.\u2019\u201d    FBN had incubated the idea for GRO internally over the past few years, testing and refining the concept with farmers, but ultimately decided to spin it out as a separate entity. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a new company that we are the sponsor of,\u201d Deshpande says. He declined to disclose FBN\u2019s ownership stake in GRO.         Farmers will share information on their practices \u2014 including fertilizer usage and tillage \u2014 with GRO Network, which FBN then runs through algorithms that leverage its massive database of farm data to distill it into a single score. That score helps buyers like Tyson Foods and Unilever source premium grain, while helping farmers make more money for taking sustainability seriously. One method of carbon scoring that GRO uses is based on a model developed by Argonne National Labs, but it expects that different customers will choose among a variety of models. \u201cThe score is associated with a bushel of grain from that farm,\u201d says Lammers. \u201cWe are building the technology, and have built much of it already, that will preserve the information as it moves through the value chain.\u201d    Matt Alford, who farms some 1,300 acres of corn and soy in southern Minnesota, is among those who signed up for the pilot projects and plans to work with GRO Network. \u201cPart of my frustration with the current farm system is there is no incentive to do things the quote-unquote right way or environmentally sound way,\u201d he says.

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings earlier this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p>The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years, Poole said.</p><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles, said Catherine Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner, at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the technology - even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology.</p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America - young people move to the cities, leaving the average age of U.S. farmers at 58, according to the Agriculture Department. Similar forces are pushing self-driving tech into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semi-truck licensed to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada with a splashy press show. Self-driving trucks are being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world.</p><p>The success of self-driving technology in agriculture could serve as a guidepost for carmakers who are trying to figure out how to move similar technologies onto U.S. streets.</p><p>Tractor makers started exploring the possibility of putting software in the driver's seat decades ago. At first, they used satellite technology to help farmers plot courses they could drive manually. About 15 years ago, John Deere started using similar systems to guide the tractors automatically, Reed said.</p><p>Crops are generally planted in one long row after another - and farmers want to make sure they use up all their land. Before auto-steering, that often meant a few feet would get reworked in every row. But with modern technology, that overlap can be reduced to less than an inch so it takes fewer passes to cover each field - saving farmers time and money.</p><p>Tractor buyers today can pile on modular systems that give computers more and more control over operations. You start with a basic satellite guidance system and a touchscreen interface, but from there the options are almost endless. Some add-ons let the tractor make very precise turns without the driver even touching the steering wheel. Others use radio base stations set up around fields to provide even more accurate navigation than satellites.</p><p>John Deere isn't the only company selling this kind of tech; its main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems, as do lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden, boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver.</p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of-the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upward of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscription fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals.</p><p>There are risks to reliance on software. Poole said one neighbor using self-driving technology downloaded a software update that disabled his tractor for a week in the middle of planting season this spring. If a system is working, farmers will often hold off on updates rather than risk complications, he said.</p><p>Those gaps could raise added cybersecurity risks. John Deere takes this issue seriously, Reed said, and encrypts its systems to protect them from hackers.</p><p>Still, issues such as digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfill the promise of autonomous vehicles is here.</p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years, Reed said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2015174522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRDYM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G92-J1X1-JCB7-10MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1107\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Daily Mail (West Virginia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 23, 2015, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000292K</classCode><className>DEERE &amp;

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way. Do not publish, will redirect to The Switch</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings earlier this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said.</p><h>On farms, the future is now</h><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles,\" said Catherine J.K. Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner, at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the technology - even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><h>Less risk, fewer rules</h><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology.</p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America - young people move to the cities, leaving the average age of U.S. farmers at 58, according to the Agriculture Department. Similar forces are pushing self-driving tech into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semi-truck licensed to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada with a splashy press show. Self-driving trucks are being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world.</p><p>The success of self-driving technology in agriculture could serve as a guidepost for carmakers who are trying to figure out how to move similar technologies onto U.S. streets.</p><p>Tractor makers started exploring the possibility of putting software in the driver's seat decades ago. At first, they used satellite technology to help farmers plot courses they could drive manually. About 15 years ago, John Deere started using similar systems to guide the tractors automatically, Reed said.</p><p>Crops are generally planted in one long row after another - and farmers want to make sure they use up all their land. Before auto-steering, that often meant a few feet would get reworked in every row. But with modern technology, that overlap can be reduced to less than an inch so it takes fewer passes to cover each field - saving farmers time and money.</p><h>Computers take the wheel</h><p>Tractor buyers today can pile on modular systems that give computers more and more control over operations. You start with a basic satellite guidance system and a touchscreen interface, but from there the options are almost endless. Some add-ons let the tractor make very precise turns without the driver even touching the steering wheel. Others use radio base stations set up around fields to provide even more accurate navigation than satellites.</p><p>John Deere isn't the only company selling this kind of tech; its main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems, as do lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden, boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver.</p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of-the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upward of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscription fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals.</p><p>There are risks to reliance on software. Poole said one neighbor using self-driving technology downloaded a software update that disabled his tractor for a week in the middle of planting season this spring. If a system is working, farmers will often hold off on updates rather than risk complications, he said.</p><p>Those gaps could raise added cybersecurity risks. John Deere takes this issue seriously, Reed said, and encrypts its systems to protect them from hackers.</p><p>Still, issues such as digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfill the promise of autonomous vehicles is here.</p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years,\" Reed said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrea.peterson@washpost.com\">andrea.peterson@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-1f992c6e-15ec-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G8J-B1B1-JBFW-C0M7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1132\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Suburban Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 22, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000292K</classCode><className>DEERE &amp;

But for years, John Deere has been selling tractors that practically drive themselves for use on farms in America's heartland, where there are few pesky pedestrians or federal rules to get in the way. Do not publish, will redirect to The Switch   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a glimpse at the future, meet Jason Poole, a 34-year-old crop consultant from Kansas. After a long day of meetings earlier this month and driving five hours across the state to watch his little girl's softball game, he was still able to run his John Deere tractor until 2 a.m., thanks to technology that left most of the driving to a computer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The land is hilly on Poole's family farm, so he drives the first curved row manually and handles the turns himself to teach the layout to his tractor's guidance system. But after that, he takes his hands off the steering wheel and allows the tractor to finish.</p><p>\"We kind of laugh when we see news stories about self-driving cars, because we've had that for years,\" Poole said.</p><p>          On farms, the future is now          </p><p>The advancements being rolled out on the farm could soon show up next door: Your neighbor can already replace his lawn mower with the John Deere equivalent of a Roomba robotic vacuum for his yard.</p><p>The self-driving technology being sold by John Deere and some of its competitors is less technically complex than the fully driverless cars that big tech companies and car manufacturers are working on. For now, the tractors are still supposed to have a driver behind the wheel - even if they never touch it.</p><p>They've already started to transform farming in America and abroad: John Deere is selling auto-steering and other self-guidance tech in more than 100 countries, said Cory Reed, vice president of the company's Intelligent Solutions Group.</p><p>\"John Deere is the largest operator of autonomous vehicles,\" said Catherine J.K. Sandoval, a California public utilities commissioner, at a recent event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Some farmers aren't shy about their enthusiasm for the technology - even uploading videos showing it off online. One appears to show a tractor hauling a planter making a tightly choreographed turn without a driver in the cab. In another, the driver takes pictures, throws paper airplanes and balances a water bottle on his nose before appearing to nod off while the tractor keeps working his field.</p><p>The systems come with their own risks, including concerns that they could be hacked. But because farm-equipment makers operate almost exclusively on private land, they've been able to bring products to market much more quickly than consumer automakers - and without the same level of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>          Less risk, fewer rules          </p><p>There are no federal rules specifically addressing self-driving tech for tractors, largely because farm equipment is designed for use in fields where it doesn't pose the same level of risk to other vehicles or people as a self-driving vehicle on a public road. The closest thing to national regulations are safety standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but the agency does not have any rules directly aimed at self-driving technology.</p><p>That lack of regulations is one reason that the future reached the farm first. But another is pure necessity: There's a labor crunch in rural America - young people move to the cities, leaving the average age of U.S. farmers at 58, according to the Agriculture Department. Similar forces are pushing self-driving tech into other industrial sectors at a pace that outstrips the consumer market. Earlier this year, the first self-driving semi-truck licensed to drive on public roads in the United States made its debut in Nevada with a splashy press show. Self-driving trucks are being rolled out for mining and oil operations in remote parts of the world.</p><p>The success of self-driving technology in agriculture could serve as a guidepost for carmakers who are trying to figure out how to move similar technologies onto U.S. streets.</p><p>Tractor makers started exploring the possibility of putting software in the driver's seat decades ago. At first, they used satellite technology to help farmers plot courses they could drive manually. About 15 years ago, John Deere started using similar systems to guide the tractors automatically, Reed said.</p><p>Crops are generally planted in one long row after another - and farmers want to make sure they use up all their land. Before auto-steering, that often meant a few feet would get reworked in every row. But with modern technology, that overlap can be reduced to less than an inch so it takes fewer passes to cover each field - saving farmers time and money.</p><p>          Computers take the wheel          </p><p>Tractor buyers today can pile on modular systems that give computers more and more control over operations. You start with a basic satellite guidance system and a touchscreen interface, but from there the options are almost endless. Some add-ons let the tractor make very precise turns without the driver even touching the steering wheel. Others use radio base stations set up around fields to provide even more accurate navigation than satellites.</p><p>John Deere isn't the only company selling this kind of tech; its main competitor, Case IH, markets similar systems, as do lesser-known companies. Some are going even further than modifying existing tractor designs: The aptly named Autonomous Tractor Corp. designed a fully autonomous tractor prototype that looks like a golden, boxy tank, but without a seat for a driver. </p><p>The systems are pricey: Outfitting a new tractor with top-of-the-line auto-steering, navigation and guidance tech could cost upward of $20,000, Reed said. There are also activation and subscription fees if farmers want to use the company's satellite or radio signals.</p><p>There are risks to reliance on software. Poole said one neighbor using self-driving technology downloaded a software update that disabled his tractor for a week in the middle of planting season this spring. If a system is working, farmers will often hold off on updates rather than risk complications, he said.</p><p>Those gaps could raise added cybersecurity risks. John Deere takes this issue seriously, Reed said, and encrypts its systems to protect them from hackers.</p><p>Still, issues such as digital security fears, along with more traditional physical safety concerns, make it hard for consumer automakers to get their self-driving vehicles past various regulators and on to public roads. But tractor makers have shown that much of the technology needed to fulfill the promise of autonomous vehicles is here.</p><p>\"All of the things we're doing on the farm will find their way into the consumer market in the coming years,\" Reed said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:andrea.peterson@washpost.com\">andrea.peterson@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-1f992c6e15ec11e59518f9e0a8959f32</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G8R-J441-JCDY-T00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1143\"/><timeReceived>2:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 22, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000292K</classCode><className>DEERE &amp;

WHAT SORT OF ANTITRUST REGIME WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE INDUSTRIAL CONCENTRATION AND CARTELIZATION THAT FACILITATED HITLER'S RISE? CONCLUSION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INTRODUCTION</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Decartelization Branch ... should, therefore, make every effort to teach the German people that political democracy cannot long survive the disappearance of economic democracy ...</p><p>--U.S. Office of Military Government Decartelization Branch, March 28, 1946</p><p>In the wake of the Second World War, the United States Congress enacted reform antitrust legislation to halt the \"rising tide of economic concentration\" in the American economy. (1) The framers of the 1950 Celler-Kefauver Act advanced a stark claim about dangers of undue concentrations of economic power: industrial \"monopolies ... brought Hitler to power,\" and the same could happen in the United States. (2) Congressman Celler and Senator Kefauver's claim arose from extensive reports by the U.S. Army's Decartelization division (operating in Germany from 1945 to 1949), which concluded that German industrial monopolies and cartels in key fields such as chemicals, armaments, steel, and electricity had played a key role in Hitler's rise to power and the atrocities of the Nazi regime. (3)</p><p>After a period of intensive antitrust enforcement against mergers and monopolies in the 1950s, '60s, and early '70s, the antitotalitarian rationale for antitrust enforcement was lost in the tectonic shift in antitrust policy begun by the Chicago School. (4) Despite occasional reminders that antitrust has a \"political content,\" antitrust law became concerned near-exclusively with the promotion of consumer welfare. (5) Debate over antitrust law and policy continued, but it was largely closeted within an establishment clique of lawyers and economists operating within the antitrust profession. (6)</p><p>The insulated, technocratic decades of antitrust may be coming to a close. In the last several years, antitrust law has achieved a political saliency that it has not experienced since its formative years around the turn of the twentieth century. From right to left, the top tiers of the political class have returned to antitrust as a popular political issue, a potential holding place for a wide variety of problems and anxieties, from wealth inequality to Big Tech's power over data and privacy. (7)</p><p>There are growing signs that, in the nascent challenge to the reigning consumer welfare regime, concerns over monopoly's effects on liberal democracy may come again to the fore, as they did at the end of the Second World War. Voices on the Democrats' progressive wing like Senator Elizabeth Warren have been warning that \"[c]oncentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy.\" (8) The influential Open Markets Institute argues that the Progressive obsession with the Supreme Court's Citizens United (9) decision ignores the equally antidemocratic effects of corporate consolidation brought about by lax antitrust. (10) The critique has migrated to the political center, with the congressional Democrats asserting that \"concentrated market power leads to concentrated political power.\" (11) Centrist policy groups like the Brookings Institution argue that stronger antitrust is necessary to prevent large tech firms from \"wield[ing] excessive influence in our democracy.\" (12)</p><p>These critiques are not limited to the political left or center. On the right, President Trump warns that allowing deals like AT&amp;T-Time Warner \"destroy[s] democracy.\" (13) Even staunch defenders of the consumer welfare standard, like Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, have recently trumpeted the importance of antitrust as a political institution--\"the magna carta of the free enterprise system\" and \"the capitalist answer to the siren song of the central planner.\" (14) Along the broad political continuum, there appears to be a consensus forming--at least a rhetorical one--that antitrust is an important institution of democracy, not merely a tool for extracting lower prices for consumers. At this potentially generative moment in antitrust history, antitrust's relationship to democracy is back on the table for reexamination.</p><p>As the relationship between monopoly and democracy seeps back into popular discourse, attention is naturally reoriented to the post-War moment when that relationship was last squarely on the table. Across a variety of political, popular, and scholarly platforms, a debate has ignited about the role of industrial monopolies and cartels in enabling Hitler's rise to power and wars of aggression. (15) The political stakes in characterizing German heavy industry's support for the Nazi regime are presentist and significant: establishing that industrial concentration contributed to the rise of fascism and that industrial concentration is on the rise in the United States lends support to those pushing urgently for a return to aggressive antitrust. On the other hand, advocates of a less interventionist antitrust regime tend to dismiss the assertion that industrial concentration was a significant factor in Hitler's rise to power, noting that many social and political factors other than industrial organization explain Nazism and that big business did not support Hitler until he was already in power. (16)</p><p>My purpose in this Article is to provide a fresh examination of the historical record on the relationship between monopoly power and the rise of the Nazi regime and to assess that relationship using concepts from contemporary economic learning and antitrust analysis. More particularly, in order to sharpen the ongoing debate over fascism and monopoly, I ask the following research questions: (1) Did industrial concentration facilitate the rise of German fascism; (2) was the problem overly large industrial organizations (i.e., \"the Curse of Bigness\") or rather organizations with excessive market power; (3) by what mechanisms did monopoly facilitate fascism; and (4) what manner of antitrust regime would have been necessary and sufficient to prevent the unholy relationship between big business and Nazism from developing? To foreshadow the answer to each of these questions briefly, I find: (1) industrial concentration did facilitate the rise of Nazism and, particularly, its consolidation of power; (2) although it is not always possible to separate the effects of large business firms from that of market power, market power did play a distinct role in facilitating Nazism; (3) the concentrated and cartelized structure of the Weimar economy contributed to the consolidation of Nazi power through several distinct mechanisms, including a Faustian bargain exchanging regime support for a privileged monopoly position, lending organizational infrastructure to the regime, and steering entire industries to the regime's bidding through expansive and coercive cartel structures; and (4) application of contemporary consumer welfare-oriented antitrust norms would have prevented most of the paths of economic power concentration that facilitated Hitler's rise and wars of aggression.</p><p>The organization of the remaining portions of this Article is as follows: Part I sets the stage by reviewing the record of political reform efforts in antitrust that grew out of perceptions that fascism ascended on the backs of monopolies. In particular, it reviews the work of the U.S. occupation authorities to document and diagnose the role of monopolies and cartels in Hitler's rise to power and consolidation of totalitarian control, the influence of this learning on the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950 and the subsequent period of aggressive antitrust enforcement, and the demise of this antitrust enthusiasm in the 1970s. It also surveys the influence of anti-Nazi thinking in the formation of Ordoliberalism, an influential school of European antitrust in the post-War period.</p><p>Part II examines the historical record on the relationship between the concentration of economic power in Weimar Germany and the subsequent concentration of political power in the Nazi regime. Section A surveys the increasing consolidation and cartelization of the German economy from unification under Bismarck at the end of the nineteenth century up to Hitler's ascension to power in 1933. Section B considers the extent to which German heavy industry supported the Nazi regime, showing that the large industrial firms were generally reluctant to support Hitler prior to 1933 but provided critical support to the Nazi regime from 1933 forward. Section C conducts case studies of three leading industries--chemicals, armaments, and electricity--showing both heterogeneity and significant common threads in the attitudes and relationships of German heavy industry with respect to the Nazi regime and the roles that different kinds of concentrated economic power played in facilitating Hitler's consolidation of political power.</p><p>Part III analyzes the mechanisms by which industrial concentration facilitated the rise and dominance of fascism and groups them into five buckets: (1) a Faustian bargain in which dominant firms exchanged financial and other material support for Hitler for implicit guarantees that their dominant positions would be protected and furthered in the new regime; (2) the ability of monopoly firms to lend the Nazi Party bureaucratic and organizational resources capable of dominating entire industries and swaths of German society at a time when the Nazis did not yet have plenary control over other critical institutions, such as the government and the military; (3) cartel structures that were easily appropriated by the Nazis to centralize power over industry, coerce unwilling firms to follow the regime's policies, monitor dissidents, and generally steer the course of industry to the regime's purposes; (4) the existence of \"national champion\" firms that enabled Hitler's rearmament plans and, through cartel agreements with foreign firms, undermined the Allies' war readiness; and (5) centralization of power and loss of democratic features within the monopoly firms themselves as they became intermeshed with the Nazi apparatus.</p><p>Finally, Part IV asks whether the history of German fascism lends support to the claim that antitrust law and enforcement need to take into account political and democratic values explicitly and not simply advance economic efficiency and consumer welfare. It shows that most of the conduct that created the economic conditions that facilitated Hitler's rise would be prohibited even under the consumer-welfare standard that governs contemporary antitrust law in the United States. While this by no means proves that consumer-welfare antitrust would have stopped Hitler, it is relevant to ongoing debates about antitrust policy to observe that the cartelization, monopolistic mergers, and naked market division agreements that pervaded Weimar Germany would not be tolerated under contemporary antitrust norms.</p><p>I. ANTITRUST'S ANTI-FASCIST TURN AND ITS DEMISE</p><p>To set the stage for this Article's substantive inquiry into the relationship between fascism and monopoly in Germany, this Part positions that inquiry in its political and legal context in the United states and Europe, both before and after the second World War. Even before American entry into the war, American political leaders had begun to identify monopolization and cartelization as root causes of fascism. In the wake of the war, spurred by political leaders who attributed Hitler's rise to the overconcentration of the German economy, the United States Office of Military Government (OMGUS) undertook an extensive \"Decartelization\" project in Germany. Although the project was shuttered in 1949 without yielding significant fruit on German soil, the research and documentation done by the Decartelization team contributed intellectually to subsequent programs of heightened antitrust enforcement in the United States and Europe. The two regimes were subject to different influences and took different paths, but they shared a common underlying concern about the role that economic concentration had played in the rise of fascism in Europe. With the passage of time and the confluence of events, the anti-fascist strand of antitrust law has eroded--to the point of oblivion in the United States and near-oblivion in Europe.</p><p>A. The Lost Concern of the Post-War Congress</p><p>1. Investigating Germany's Monopolies and Cartels</p><p>Before American entry into the Second World War, American political leaders were already arguing that cartels and monopolies were propelling the rise of fascism. In a 1938 address, President Roosevelt asserted that the essence of fascism was \"the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the[] democratic state itself.\" (17) With the advent of war, American political rhetoric linking fascism to industrial monopolization and cartelization increased. In the winter of 1943-1944, the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on War Mobilization of the Committee of Military Affairs held hearings on the influence of German cartels and monopolies in Hitler's rise to power and their cooption of American industry. (18) Senator Harley Kilgore, who chaired the committee, would later write that \"[t]he cartel system, in great measure, was responsible\" for Hitler's dictatorship as the cartels' \"funds and influence made possible Nazi seizure of power.\" (19) In September of 1944, President Roosevelt characterized Germany's cartels as \"weapons of economic warfare\" that would have to be eradicated along with the Wehrmacht. (20)</p><p>As victory neared in Europe, the U.S. military prepared to carry out the president's directive to decartelize Germany. In April of 1945, General Eisenhower issued an order to the U.S. Army to \"prohibit all cartels or other private business arrangements and cartel-like organizations.\" (21) The Potsdam Agreement of August 1945 provided that \"[a]t the earliest practicable date, the German economy shall be decentralized for the purpose of eliminating the present excessive concentration of economic power as exemplified in particular by cartels, syndicates, trusts and other monopolistic arrangements.\" (22) A U.S. Decartelization Branch was established on December 15, 1945 as a branch of the Economics Division of OMGUS, with a mandate to deconcentrate and decartelize German industry. (23) The Decartelization Branch explicitly linked its economic and political goals:</p><p>The Decartelization Branch, acting with and through other Military Government activities should, therefore, make every effort to teach the German people that political democracy cannot long survive the disappearance of economic democracy, and that the freedom of the individual consumer to buy and sell in freely competitive markets is the economic philosophy most suitable to their needs. (24)</p><p>The Decartelization Branch was well staffed, with ninety-four lawyers and investigators at its peak. (25) It was largely responsible for the breakup of the I.G. Farben chemical combine (discussed in greater detail in Part II below) in 1945. (26) Thereafter, it identified an additional seventy firms or cartel organizations as potential targets for breakup or dissolution. (27) A February 12, 1947 decartelization law promulgated by OMGUS gave further legal status to the Decartelization Branch's efforts. (28) Nonetheless, the Farben breakup proved to be the program's one substantial achievement. The program was largely shuttered in 1949, depleted of personnel and demoralized. (29) The Secretary of the \"Ferguson Committee\" that investigated the operation of the German decartelization program and rendered a critical report on it opined that a variety of factors contributed to the program's failure, including confusion over the program's aims and objectives, lack of support by American allies, lack of support by the German people, and lack of support from American officials and the American business community. (30)</p><p>If the decartelization program failed to achieve significant remedial results in the German economy, it nonetheless provided a useful service by thoroughly researching and reporting on the concentrated and cartelized state of the German economy and the role of that concentration and cartelization in the rise and perpetuation of the Nazi regime. The program's reports on specific firms and industries and on the history and nature of German industrial concentration and cartelization more generally became focal points for subsequent political discourse and reforms concerning concentration in the American economy, most particularly with respect to the Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950.</p><p>2. The Anti-Fascist Roots of the Celler-Kefauver Amendment to Section 7 of the Clayton Act</p><p>In 1950, Congress enacted the Celler-Kefauver Act, substantially expanding Section 7 of the Clayton Act of 1914, which prohibits anticompetitive mergers. (31) At a technical level, Celler-Kefauver accomplished three things: (1) closing the asset \"loophole,\" which had allowed merging firms to escape Section 7's coverage through asset, rather than stock, acquisitions; (2) deleting \"acquiring-acquired\" language in the original text of Section 7 that could be read to limit Section 7 to horizontal mergers and exclude coverage of vertical and conglomerate mergers; and (3) clarifying that Section 7 reached \"incipient\" trends toward increasing concentration levels that might threaten competition. (32) In a more general sense, Celler-Kefauver served up a congressional mandate for a post-War program of intensive antimerger enforcement by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission from the 1950s through the early 1970s to stem the perceived \"rising tide of economic concentration in the American economy.\" (33)</p><p>As the Supreme Court acknowledged in Brown Shoe, the Act's legislative history reveals \"Congress' fear not only of accelerated concentration of economic power on economic grounds, but also of the threat to other values a trend toward concentration was thought to pose.\" (34) Although the Supreme Court did not specify what \"other values\" Congress perceived to be at stake, floor statements by the bill's two primary sponsors--New York Senator Emanuel Celler and Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver--reveal a preoccupation with the political consequences of concentrated economic power, particularly in the correlation between industrial cartelization and monopoly and the rise of fascism in pre-War Germany, and with totalitarianism more broadly. Celler and Kefauver relied heavily on work generated from the findings of the Decartelization Branch. Celler warned:</p><p>I want to point out the danger of this trend toward more and better combines. I read from a report filed with former Secretary of War Royall as to the history of the cartelization and concentration of industry in Germany: Germany under the Nazi set-up built up a great series of industrial monopolies in steel, rubber, coal and other materials. The monopolies soon got control of Germany, brought Hitler to power and forced virtually the whole world into war. The report continues: A high degree of concentration throughout industry fosters the formation of cartels and readily enables a war-minded government to mobilize for hostilities. Such was the history of war preparations in Germany in both World War I and World War II. (35)</p><p>Senator Kefauver seconded Celler's anti-totalitarian themes. The rising tide of concentration would lead to totalitarianism of either the fascist or Stalinist variety:</p><p>I am not an alarmist, but the history of what has taken place in other nations where mergers and concentrations have placed economic control in the hands of a very few people is too clear to pass over easily. A point is eventually reached, and we are rapidly reaching that point in this country, where the public steps in to take over when concentration and monopoly gain too much power. The taking over by the public through its government always follows one or two methods and has one or two political results. It either results in a Fascist state or the nationalization of industries and thereafter a Socialist or Communist state. Most businessmen realize this inevitable result. Certain monopolistic interests are being very shortsighted in not appreciating the plight to which they are forcing their Government. (36)</p><p>Celler and Kefauver's floor speeches reflected a broader concern of the U.S. Congress and other national institutions that industrial concentration facilitated the incubation of totalitarianism and threatened democracy. (37) Senator Charles Kersten of Wisconsin linked the dangers of \"big government\" and \"business so big that it is monopolized in the hands of a very few.\" (38) Senator William Langer of North Dakota introduced into the record a March 26, 1947 Christian Science Monitor article warning of the \"danger ... for any democracy which allows economic concentration of power to spread at the expense of small business.\" (39) For its part, the Federal Trade Commission warned that \"[i]f nothing is done to check the growth in concentration, either the giant corporations will ultimately take over the Country or the Government will be impelled to step in and impose some form of direct regulation.... In either event, collectivism will have triumphed over free enterprise.\" (40)</p><p>The period of post-war antimerger enthusiasm, which lasted roughly from 1950 to the mid-1970s, thus reflected, at its core, a deep concern that industrial concentration threatened the democratic order, as evidenced by the recent experience with Nazism.</p><p>3. Post-War Antimerger Enthusiasm and Its Demise</p><p>The Celler-Kefauver Act empowered the federal antitrust agencies to pursue an antimerger agenda that included successful challenges to many mergers that posed little, if any, immediate threat of oligopolistic concentration. (41) The federal courts largely rubber-stamped the agencies' enforcement agenda in the 1950s through the mid-1970s, leading Justice Stewart famously to complain in dissent that \"[t]he sole consistency that I can find is that in litigation under [Section 7 of the Clayton Act], the Government always wins.\" (42)</p><p>The period of enthusiastic merger-busting subsided in the mid-1970s as a result of two distinct forces. One was the rise of the Chicago School of economic analysis, which had been mounting a critique of post-War antitrust since at least the 1950s and succeeded in conquering the Supreme Court by the late 1970s. (43) The Supreme Court signaled a turn toward Chicago in one of its last major merger decisions of the 1970s, General Dynamics, (44) shortly after which it got out of the merger business entirely. The Court has not decided a merger case on the merits since 1975. (45)</p><p>And, not coincidentally, that was also the year of the second distinctive force that ended the era of enthusiastic merger-busting--the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Hart-Scott created a premerger notification system and effectively shifted merger review out of the courts and into the agencies, from an adjudicatory model to an administrative model. (46) Following Hart-Scott, merger control settled into a technocratic data-crunching exercise performed by professional economists more interested in the predictive power on prices and output from changes in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index than the veiled specter of fascism. (47)</p><p>Chicago and Hart-Scott killed the aggressively anti-incipiency version of Celler and Kefauver's project, but what happened to the concern with economic concentration leading to political concentration? Many different forces, including dimming collective memory of the war, distrust of governmental institutions post-Watergate, and the rise of the consumerist movement, had a hand in the demise of the antimerger regime. (48) But one particular angle has the strongest explanatory power: the anti-fascist political strain of Celler-Kefauver ideology coincided so neatly with the rising economic theory of antimerger enforcement--structuralism--that the two lines became intermeshed and inseparable. Then, when Chicago demolished structuralism empirically and theoretically to the point that even leading structuralists admitted error and moved on, (49) structuralism pulled down anti-fascism in its collapse. Anti-fascism was effectively subsumed in structuralism, and hence shared its fate.</p><p>Few schools of antitrust thought have enjoyed such temporal success as the structuralist school, which came to become known as the Harvard School because of its association with Harvard professors Carl Kaysen, Donald Turner, and Phil Areeda, and Joe Bain, a Harvard-trained economist who spent the bulk of his career at the University of California, Berkeley. (50) Structuralism's core and elegant tenet was that a strong, deterministic relationship exists between a market's structure, conduct, and performance (thus giving rise to the Structure-Conduct-Performance, or just S-C-P, paradigm). (51) Concentration was the most significant component of structure. (52) Thus, a highly concentrated market inexorably led to anticompetitive firm behavior, and such behavior inexorably led to poor market performance, expressed as higher prices and lower quality. (53) The upshot was that the government could directly attack concentrated market structures without worrying about the specific mechanisms (conduct) that led from that structure to poor market performance. (54) Structuralism had the virtue of aiming for the same policy objectives--reducing economic concentration through active scrutiny of mergers and market dominance--as suggested by the anti-fascist strain of post-War antitrust ideology. (55)</p><p>Structuralism prevailed in the academy, antitrust agencies, courts, and political institutions until the mid-1970s. In late 1967, President Lyndon Johnson secretly asked Phil Neal, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, to lead a commission of distinguished economists and lawyers to report on the state of competition in the United States and recommend potential changes to the antitrust laws. (56) Johnson intended to use the report as part of his reelection campaign, but he eventually decided not to seek reelection because of the unpopularity of the Vietnam War. (57) Nonetheless, the commission concluded its work and released its report. The report represented the high watermark of structuralist thinking. It proposed a Concentrated Industries Act that would give the Attorney General a mandate to \"search out\" oligopolies and order divestiture to the point that no firm would end up with a market share exceeding 12 percent. (58) It also proposed a much stronger structuralist presumption in horizontal merger cases, condemning any merger in which the four-firm concentration ratio exceeded 50 percent and one of the firms involved in the merger had a market share exceeding 10 percent. (59)</p><p>None of the report's recommendations was adopted into law. Not only did Richard Nixon's election kill off its immediate political prospects, but by the early 1970s the Chicago School was rapidly eroding structuralism's theoretical and empirical assumptions. In the 1970s, Turner underwent a \"conversion experience\" in which he accepted many of the Chicago School critiques of the S-C-P paradigm. (60) Vestiges of structuralist thinking appeared as late as 1979 in various iterations of the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission's Horizontal Merger Guidelines (61) and in Jimmy Carter's National Commission to Review Antitrust Law and Procedures's recommended adoption of a no-fault monopolization statute. (62) But the S-C-P paradigm had long since been intellectually and politically vanquished. The Harvard School that undergirded the antimerger regime of the 1950s and '60s morphed into a neo-Harvard School that focused on institutionalism (the institutional and procedural mechanisms of antitrust enforcement) rather than structuralism as a theory of market behavior. (63)</p><p>Structuralism's claims were distinct from the anti-totalitarian claims of Celler and Kefauver. S-C-P was a purely descriptive economic theory, if such a thing exists. All of Chicago's empirical and theoretical refutations of S-C-P could have been well taken without touching the separate Celler-Kefauver claim that an aggressive industrial deconcentration regime was necessary to prevent the consolidation of political power and erosion of democracy. Nonetheless, the temporal coincidence and prescriptive alignment of the political and economic theories contributed to the demise of the political theory when the economic theory fell. Merger policy in the 1970s concerned the predictive power of the S-C-P's models; once those models were discredited, Celler-Kefauver's political project largely ended too without separate examination. The anti-fascist strand of post-War antitrust ideology vanished from American political and legal discourse without almost any separate consideration.</p><p>B. Fascism and European Ordoliberalism</p><p>The fate of the anti-fascist strand of American antitrust law can be contrasted with another post-War, anti-fascist antitrust ideology that has had a much longer political run--the Ordoliberalism of the Freiburg School, which viewed economic competition as a key constitutional guarantor of liberty and continues to exert influence in the European Union. (64) Ordoliberalism has its roots in pre-War Germany largely as a reaction to the failure of the Weimar state and the rise of Nazism. (65) Franz Bohm, Walter Eucken, and Hans Grossmann-Doerth, professors at Freiburg, penned their Ordo Manifesto in 1936 amid the dominion of National Socialism and were elevated to prominence during the Allied reconstruction of Germany. (66)</p><p>Methodologically, the Ordoliberals lamented the compartmentalization of academic disciplines, particularly economics. According to Eucken, \"during the nineteenth century economic thought gradually had become isolated, and economists had lost sight of both the political and social contexts of economic issues.\" (67) As a result, the liberal tradition had become narrowly associated with laissez-faire political ideology. The Ordoliberals sought to promote moralistic and humane values by fusing economic and legal understanding into a comprehensive account of a just and liberal social order.</p><p>Competition entered the Ordoliberal framework not merely as instrumental to achieving consumer or social welfare but as a fundamental requirement of social justice and a well-functioning democratic society. (68) Free economic participation by all citizens was the primary channel for achieving liberal and humane values. (69) Market power by individuals or firms stood in the way of this goal. According to Ordoliberalism, \"[t]he economic problems of the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany were attributable in part to the inability of the legal system to control and, if necessary, to disperse private economic power.\" (70) Accordingly, the state had an affirmative obligation to promote market competition in order to secure liberal goals.</p><p>A major point of difference between Ordoliberalism and mainstream Anglo-American traditions is that the Freiburg School conceived of competition principles as bedrock constitutional principles operating on both the state and private actors. (71) Although the U.S. Supreme Court has described the Sherman Act as the \"Magna Carta of free enterprise,\" (72) the U.S. antitrust laws have never been understood as constitutional in any meaningful sense. (73) The government has no affirmative obligation to protect any private firm or individual from monopolistic oppression. It may and frequently does exempt large actors from antitrust scrutiny and, more generally, makes judgments about what degrees of market power are tolerable or intolerable insofar as they promote or retard efficiency. (74)</p><p>By contrast, the Ordoliberals understood the promotion of individual economic freedom as a core obligation of the state. Freedom, in this lexicography, meant the absence of arbitrary control by private actors. Even if concentrations of market power could advance economic efficiency, the government could not permit such concentrations without compromising the liberal interest in personal freedom. As Bohm explained, \"[i]f we want freedom, we have no option but to sacrifice some advantage which we could obtain only by employing concentrated power.\" (75)</p><p>Ordoliberalism resonated with Brandeisian atomistic competition values and the belief in antitrust law as creating a level playing field and economic opportunity. (76) Consistent with antitrust's historical tendency to draw support from both right and left, (77) the Ordoliberal tradition resonated with some on the populist-libertarian right like Friedrich von Hayek who maintained close intellectual connections to the Freiburg school and made frequent contributions to the ORDO journal. (78)</p><p>Partly owing to its proponents' anti-Nazi credentials and its lineage as an anti-Nazi ideology, Ordoliberalism grew in favor during the post-War era. (79) With West Germany's meteoric economic growth paralleling the rise of European integration and the creation of European-wide antitrust principles, Ordoliberalism was poised to become an important--perhaps the dominant--European antitrust ideology. Comparativists often explain divergencdivergences between U.S. and EU antitrust law in recent decades as founded on Europe's Ordoliberal commitments that have no analogue in contemporary U.S. antitrust ideology. (80)</p><p>Ordoliberalism, like Celler-Kefauver anti-concentrationism, linked industrial pluralism with political pluralism and owed its ascent to the demise of mid-century fascism. Why, then, did Ordoliberalism survive as an antitrust ideology in Europe long after anti-fascism faded as an antitrust ideology in the United States? The lines of influence are many and complex, but an important differentiating factor was that Ordoliberalism never became conceptually and politically comingled with a \"purely economic\" theory of concentration and oligopoly, as occurred with respect to the Celler-Kefauver legacy in the United States. Ordoliberalism remained a moral theory of coercion and restraint that recognized the possible efficiency costs of a deconcentrated economy and demanded it nonetheless in light of recent European experience. Hence, when the assault on economic structuralism arrived in the 1970s, European Ordoliberalism did not find its fundamental claims threatened.</p><p>In recent years, the European Commission has stated a goal of moving away from a \"form-based\" approach to an \"effects-based\" approach to com petition law issues, which is widely seen as throwing down the gauntlet to Ordoliberalism. (81) This is occurring at a time when the economics profession has moved somewhat away from the more laissez-faire prescriptions of the Chicago school, so the implications for European antitrust law are not as liberalizing as the Chicago assault on structuralism in the 1970s. Still, this shift, if ultimately endorsed by other elite European institutions (particularly the General Court and Court of Justice), could bring to a close the post-War European experiment with antitrust as an explicitly democracy- and pluralism-reinforcing institution. It is perhaps a sign of antitrust's inherently cyclical nature that Europe appears to be moving away from a political conception of antitrust just as that theme is reemerging in American political discourse.</p><p>Both the United States and Europe experienced periods--albeit a longer one in Europe--in which the shades of Nazism and the role of monopolies and cartels in supporting the Third Reich motivated the dominant antitrust ideology of the day, at least in part. On both sides of the Atlantic, those influences have waned over time as antitrust has become more technocratic and focused on efficiency and consumer welfare. Today, as the political value of antitrust as a democracy-reinforcing instrument is under reexamination at the highest levels in Washington, the forgotten learning of the post-War period deserves reexamination as well. But the political rhetoric of the post-War era linked German industrial concentration and cartelization, and the Nazi regime should not be accepted without critical examination. As discussed below, many scholars have questioned the degree to which German heavy industry actually supported Hitler, and some have urged caution in accepting the characterizations of the Decartelization Branch, which have been described as the product of zealous American trustbusters and prosecutors primarily concerned about playing to a domestic American audience and supporting an enhanced antitrust regime in the United States. (82) Drawing on the work of the Decartelization Branch and independent historical sources, the following Sections assess the evidence concerning the relationship between German industrial concentration and cartelization and the rise of Hitler.</p><p>II. GERMAN INDUSTRIAL CONCENTRATION AND THE NAZI REGIME</p><p>There can be no doubt that the German economy had become extremely consolidated and cartelized by the end of the Weimar Republic and that many dominant German firms and cartels played significant roles in the malevolent business of the Third Reich. However, historians have long debated the extent to which the monopolies and cartels were instigators of Nazism, or rather its hapless pawns. This Part begins to reframe the question away from the one often debated by historians--the moral culpability or volitional participation of heavy industry--and toward an inquiry into whether the extremely concentrated structure of an economy may facilitate the extreme concentration of political power, regardless of the conscious intentions of dominant firms.</p><p>A. The Cartelization and Consolidation of German Industry from Bismarck to the Third Reich</p><p>The roots of German industrial consolidation leading up to the monopolization and cartelization of industry under the Third Reich run back to the unification of Germany under Otto von Bismarck. Professor Wilhelm Roepke identified 1879 as the year when Germany began a transformation from free trade to cartelization (control of an industry through orchestration by a number of firms) and monopolization (dominance of an industry by one or two leading firms) as Bismarck pushed an industrial policy supporting \"hierarchical organization and centralization\" of all aspects of economic life. (83) Cartelization began to grow rapidly in the German economy, with German courts upholding and enforcing cartel agreements in the last decades of the nineteenth century. (84) Cartelization was not only tolerated but actively encouraged by state policy. An 1888 Bavarian Supreme Court decision declared that \"it is incumbent upon prudent business men belonging to a branch of industry which is suffering from a depression to get together and enter into agreements regulating the ways and means of operating their industry with a view to promoting recovery.\" (85) In 1897, just as the U.S. Supreme Court was interpreting the Sherman Act to foreclose the argument that cartel agreements were necessary to prevent \"ruinous competition\" and establish \"reasonable prices,\" (86) the German Supreme Court was accepting just such assertions. (87)</p><p>Despite occasional political contestation over the benefits of cartelization, the number of cartels continued to grow during the imperial period, expanding from raw materials to manufactured goods. (88) During the First World War, the German government moved from tolerance of cartels to active compulsion, enforcing and managing price fixing agreements and production quotas as part of the government's industrial policy. (89) Following the war, cartelization continued to grow rapidly, leading to some political backlash (mostly arising out of Bavaria) concerning the effects of cartels on consumers. (90) The government did little to arrest the growing tide of cartelization until 1923, when it passed a cartel decree that, if anything, reinforced the legal status and protection of cartels. (91) Although providing for the terminability of cartel agreements by parties to the contract upon a showing of good cause and subjecting the agreements to the control and supervision of the government, the decree now gave cartels explicit statutory recognition. (92) Further, the regulatory provisions were generally not enforced by the government, which showed little interest in arresting the spread of cartelization. (93) German courts continued to show little interest in reigning in cartels and monopolies. (94)</p><p>Unfettered by a government ranging from complacent to affirmatively enthusiastic for cartels, cartelization progressively swept through the German economy from the time of Bismarck to the Third Reich. One German historian estimated the following numbers of cartel agreements in Germany by year: 4 in 1865; 70 in 1887; 300 in 1900; 600 in 1911; 1,000 in 1922; 2,100 in 1930; and 2,500 by 1943. (95) These included most significant industries: coal, iron and steel, steel processing, wire and cable, machinery, vehicles, non-ferrous metals, building materials, chemicals, rubber, textiles, paper, printing, wood, electrotechnical, optics, porcelain and stoneware, glass, leather, sugar, food, and brewing and milling. (96) Germany has been called \"the fatherland of the cartel movement.\" (97)</p><p>In the economic distress and disorganization that followed the First World War, many of Germany's cartels and syndicates found themselves in a state of decay, which paved the way for the second stage of concentration--outright monopolization in many industries--facilitated by German bankers. (98) Many industries transitioned from tight cartelization to merger to monopoly, as for example the chemical industry, which merged from two cartels into a single integrated firm in 1925.99 The steel industry also moved through mergers and acquisitions in the direction of large, vertically integrated conglomerates. (100) By the time the Nazis came to power, significant swaths of the German economy were subject to monopolies or near monopolies. These included, among many others:</p><p>* Wintershall Potash Works, controlling over two-thirds of the German potash industry; (101)</p><p>* Robert Bosch, GmbH, with a near-monopoly position in fuel injection equipment and magnets; (102)</p><p>* Siemens &amp; Halske A.G. and Allgemeine-Elektrizitaets-Geselleschaft (\"AEG\"), collectively controlling over three-quarters of the electro-technical industry; (103)</p><p>* I.G. Farben, with monopoly or near-monopoly shares in many segments of the chemical industry; (104)</p><p>* Deutsche Zuendwaren-Monopolgesellschaft, with a complete monopoly over all match sales in Germany pursuant to a 1930 Reichstag law; (105)</p><p>* Henschel und Sohn, GmbH, with a dominant position in locomotive and heavy machine manufacturing; (106)</p><p>* The Krupp armaments firm, with a monopoly over heavy artillery and many other military product lines; (107)</p><p>* Vereinigte Stahlwerke (United Steel Works), created in 1926 by the merger of three major steel firms; (108) and</p><p>* The Degussa firm, with a dominant position in precious met als. (109)</p><p>In sum, before Hitler came to power, the German economy had been thoroughly cartelized and monopolized. A 1946 report of the Decartelization Branch summed up the situation as follows:</p><p>[D]espite war, defeat, inflation, and depression, the concentration of German industry proceeded without interruption as merger succeeded merger. By 1928 the officers and directors of the principal combines were in a position to dictate national economic policy, sometimes but not always in consultation with state officials. In fact, such companies as Vereinigte Stahlwerke and I.G. Farben, producing a wide range of raw materials, semi-finished products and commodities themselves, and a vastly wider range through their numerous subsidiaries and affiliates, were in effect an industrial dictatorship capable (should it suit their purposes) of reorganizing the German state. (110)</p><p>As previously noted, contemporary historians urge caution in relying on rhetorical characterizations in the Decartelization Branch reports, which were made \"for prosecutorial purposes by persons who were also trustbusters\" and often were not well steeped in German economic history. (111) But whether or not the industrial giants that dominated Germany's business landscape in the Weimar period are rightly characterized as an \"industrial dictatorship,\" the high degree of concentration and cartelization in the German industry and the monopolies' practical power to reorganize the German state is beyond peradventure.</p><p>B. German Heavy Industry's Support for the Nazi Regime</p><p>The historical record on heavy industry's support for the Nazi regime is hotly contested. Marxist-leaning historians have consistently taken the view that capitalist monopolies supported Hitler's ascent. (112) For instance, Dietrich Eichholtz, writing in East Germany in 1969, faulted the \"leading German monopolies[] for their initiative and leading role\" in propelling the Nazi march toward war. (113) By contrast, among non-Marxists there has been no such consensus, with many taking the position that the captains of industry were largely not supportive of Hitler until he was already in power, at which point they had no choice but to fall in line with the Nazi regime. (114)</p><p>Much of the dispute over the characterization of the historical record turns on questions of timing. Adherents to the view that big business pushed Hitler's ascent point to early support from Fritz Thyssen of the steel combine, who began to contribute funds to Hitler's coffers in 1923, (115) and Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank. (116) On January 27, 1932, a year before Hitler became chancellor, Thyssen organized a meeting at the Industry Club of Dusseldorf to introduce Hitler to leading industrialists. (117) According to Thyssen's first-person account (published after he fell out with Hitler), the meeting resulted in \"a number of large contributions flow[ing] from the resources of heavy industry into the treasuries of the National Socialist party.\" (118) Similarly, OMGUS's Decartelization Report claimed that, in the final years of the Weimar Republic, industrialist Emil Kirdorf used his influence in the domestic coal cartel to levy assessments on every ton of coal mined or sold to raise money for the Nazis, (119) although historians have questioned the extent of Kirdorf's support for the Nazis before 1934. (120)</p><p>Despite early support for Hitler by a few industrialists, the historical record does not bear out claims that Germany's monopolies and cartels were pining for Hitler's rise or providing material support to his ascension during most of the years of the Nazi Party's ascent from 1919 forward. Yale historian Henry Turner observed that \"most of the political money of big business went, throughout the last years of the republic, to the conservative opponents of the Nazis\" and that most of the business community backed Paul von Hindenburg against Hitler in the 1932 presidential campaign. (121) Similarly, George Hallgarten observed that \"[d]own to 1929 [the Nazi Party] appears to have lived, in the main, on membership dues and individual gifts, mainly from local South German producers. A donation by Fritz Thyssen in 1923 remained an isolated fact.\" (122)</p><p>The situation changed with Hitler's ascension as chancellor on January 30, 1933. (123) Leading industrialists, who were often more motivated by profits than political ideology, began to bet on Hitler's political future and its implications for their businesses. On February 20, 1933, Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank organized a meeting among Hitler, Hermann Goring, and several dozen leading industrialists, including executives from the Krupp, Bosch, Farben, and United Steel Works firms, during which Hitler promised to destroy the Marxists and rearm Germany. (124) The industrialists responded with enthusiasm, and Schacht collected three million Reichsmarks in donations to the Nazis. (125) On February 27, 1933--perhaps not coincidentally the day of the Reichstag fire--the I.G. Farben chemical monopoly deposited RM 400,000 in the Nazi Party's coffers. (126) A succession of further donations followed, providing Hitler with a source of extragovernmental funding even while he struggled to consolidate his power over the state. (127) As discussed further below, the Krupp armaments monopoly led a fundraising effort among twenty other leading industrial firms a month later, raising millions of reichmarks for the Nazis. That these donations may have been made through \"political extortion\" and without enthusiasm by the industrial donors does not diminish the fact that they were made and that, through them, \"big business was helping consolidate Hitler's rule.\" (128)</p><p>Although the best reading of the historical record suggests that most of the Weimar monopolies and cartelists were not generally disposed to support Hitler and did not do so until he was already grabbing the reins of power, this Article's purpose is not to judge the ethical responsibility of heavy industry for the rise of German fascism but rather to understand the ways in which the concentrated economic structure of industry may facilitate the rise of totalitarian government. In this vein, it is important to make clear that the thesis that extremely concentrated economic power facilitated Hitler's rise to power is distinct from the controversy that has occupied historians since the end of the Second World War about whether the Nazi regime was an outgrowth of capitalism. In German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler, Turner systematically debunked the claim that the captains of heavy industry deliberately boosted Hitler to power, which Turner saw as an inaccurate interpretation of history for anticapitalist ideological purposes. (129) Turner argued that support for Hitler was much more concentrated among small businessmen, who felt trapped between the powerful and rapacious monopolies and cartels, on the one hand, and the labor unions, on the other. (130) But that small business may have supported Hitler's rise while big business largely did not does not prevent the concentrated structure of German industry from having contributed significantly to the Third Reich's ascent, just as other structures of German society may have helped the Nazis without being designed to do so. Nor is it an indictment of capitalism in general to observe that extreme monopolization and cartelization may pose a threat to democracy--capitalism, tended by anti-monopoly principles, need not result in extreme monopolization and cartelization. Thus, the record of German heavy industry's lack of willing support for the rise of the Nazis before 1933 is only one small piece of the wider story of how the steady cartelization and monopolization of the German economy from the time of Bismarck through the end of the Weimar Republic set the stage for the fascist period that followed.</p><p>C. Concentration and Nazi Facilitation in Three Principal Industries</p><p>As discussed in the previous Section, the story of big business support for Hitler is contested, complex, and varied. This Section presents case studies from three German industries--chemicals, electricity, and armaments--that were critical to Hitler's consolidation of power, Germany's rearmament, and its wars of aggression. Each industry was dominated by one or two large firms subsequently charged with war crimes. The case studies reveal both the heterogeneity and homogeneity of the relationship between monopoly and fascism. On the one hand, the principal firms differed in their enthusiasm for competition, monopolization, and cartelization and in their support for the Nazi regime. On the other hand, all three industries were characterized by high levels of economic concentration and played a role in Hitler's consolidation of political and economic power. The case studies that follow survey the paths by which the leading firms in these industries rose to economic dominance, their attitudes toward Nazism, what they concretely and specifically did to support it and when, and how they benefitted from it once they had Hitler's favor. Although the firms differed in how they supported the Third Reich, the common pattern of dominance across industries played a crucial role in consolidating the Nazis' power.</p><p>1. Chemicals</p><p>Among the German firms most important to the rise of Nazism and the perpetuation of its atrocities, none was more significant than the I.G. Farben chemical cartel. (131) A 1945 OMGUS Report on the Investigation of I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G. concluded that Farben, although \"nominally a private business enterprise,\" was \"in fact, a colossal empire serving the German State as one of the principal industrial cores around which successive German drives for world conquest have been organized\" and served as \"a trump which... almost enabled Hitler and Goering to extinguish the flame of freedom and human decency everywhere.\" (132)</p><p>Ironically, for all of the headaches it would eventually induce, the story of I.G. Farben's rise to power begins with a growing German chemical company--Bayer--which introduced the world to aspirin in 1899. (133) Inspired by the American trusts of the Gilded Age, which were just beginning to receive serious antitrust scrutiny, Bayer entered into a pooling arrangement with two other chemical companies--BASF and Agfa--in 1904. (134) A rival chemical pool, headed by the Hoechst firm and including six German chemical companies, formed in the same year. (135) The two rival pools operated as conventional cartels, including coordination on pricing, research and development, investment decisions, market allocations, and entry into foreign markets. (136)</p><p>In 1916, with the British making inroads at the Somme, the two pools began to fret about the advent of foreign competition following the war. (137) These anxieties resulted in a combination of the two trusts into a single mega-trust or profit-sharing pool, with the power to enable industry-wide coordination with respect to pricing, research and development, patent strategies, legal affairs, and insurance. (138) The cartel structure persisted until 1925, when the pool's nine members underwent a final corporate integration, merging into a single corporate entity (albeit with a complex structure of subsidiaries and holdings). (139) Thereafter, until its dissolution in the postwar era, Farben no longer operated as a \"chemical cartel\" as it is often styled in the literature. In modern legal and economic terms, it was an integrated, widely held corporation, with 140,000 shareholders. (140)</p><p>After the great merger of 1925, Farben continued to extend its control over the German chemical industry and adjacent sectors that were important to Germany's rearmament project. A series of 1936 agreements ceded control over the German explosives industry to Farben. (141) But it was a 1930 market division agreement with the American company Standard Oil of New Jersey, or Esso, that garnered the most critical attention after the commencement of hostilities.</p><p>In the convention of the times, Farben had long engaged in global market division agreements with foreign rivals. A 1923 agreement with the Sterling unit of the American firm Winthrop Chemical had allocated to Sterling the right to market aspirin in the United States, some of the Commonwealth countries, and South America, and to Farben the rest of the globe. (142) In 1925, Farben initiated similar discussions with Standard Oil, these on the question of synthetic fuel. (143) After a five-year courtship, the negotiations resulted in the creation of the Joint American Study Company (JASCO), a research and development joint venture that also involved allocation of global markets for hydrogenated fuel. (144)</p><p>Since Farben's exclusive area was limited to Germany, the fuel market-division agreement turned out to be relatively unimportant to subsequent war efforts. But a separate agreement turned out to be hugely damaging to U.S. interests. In addition to fuel, a form of synthetic rubber called buna can be extracted from coal. The parties enlarged the JASCO agreement to include joint research and development related to buna. Under the terms of the agreement, Standard Oil was obliged to assign to Farben any patents and know-how related to buna production. (145) Farben had no reciprocal obligation, although, in 1930, the parties had anticipated some sort of collaboration on the marketing of buna. (146) However, as Germany remilitarized, Farben became integrated into the Wehrmacht, and buna became strategically important to military mobilizations, Farben began to drag its feet on sharing any proprietary information with Standard Oil. (147) Other American manufacturers interested in manufacturing synthetic rubber, such as Goodyear Rubber Company and Dow Chemical, unsuccessfully sought a patent license from Standard Oil, which stalled them on a licensing arrangement due to being stalled themselves by Farben. (148) The JASCO arrangement had the effect of delaying American development of buna by a number of years. (149)</p><p>After Pearl Harbor and the commencement of the war in the Pacific, American access to rubber supplies from Southeast Asia faltered and access to synthetic rubber became critical. (150) Due to Farben's cooption of Standard Oil under the JASCO agreement, American scientists were far behind in developing their own way of producing buna, and it took an immense expenditure of time and effort to catch up to the Germans. (151) The U.S. War Depart-Department felt that the cooption of Standard's buna research efforts by Farben \"seriously imperiled the war preparations of the United States.\" (152) So did the United States Justice Department, which indicted and convicted Standard Oil, six subsidiaries, and three executives on charges of criminally conspiring with Farben to restrict trade in synthetic fuel and buna. (153)</p><p>With Hitler's rise to power in the early 1930s, Farben initially resisted Nazification, worried about potential ill effects on its global business of becoming overly intertwined with a controversial political party. (154) However, by the mid-1930s, the firm's management had acceded to the reality that alliance with the Nazis was critical to the continued success of the Farben enterprise. The firm purged its Jewish managers, began making financial contributions to Hitler's slush fund, and began to align politically with the Nazis. (155) By 1935-1936, as Hitler's rearmament project intensified, the firm became organizationally intermeshed with the Wehrmacht. (156) From then until the end of the war, Farben effectively served as an industrial branch of the Nazi regime, with profits continuing to flow to the firm's managers and shareholders.</p><p>The rewards of the Nazi alliance paid off handsomely. By the late 1930s, Farben controlled almost all German chemical and synthetic production, including 100% of synthetic rubber, 100% of lubricating oils, 100%</p><p>of serums, 90% of plastics, 88% of magnesium, 84% of explosives, and 75% of nitrogen. (157) Even during the economic downturn of the Great Depression, Farben continued to earn handsome profits. (158)</p><p>Following the Austrian Anschluss of 1938 and the German invasion of much of Europe beginning the following year, Farben gobbled up the chemical industries in the conquered territories, annexing them into the Farben empire. (159) Farben effectively served as the prime economic arm of Germany's European conquests, coercing firms in conquered territories to sell cheaply or simply taking them over. Tragically, Farben also served as one of the many faces of Third Reich evil, running a factory concentration camp at Auschwitz and supplying the Zyklon B gas used to exterminate Jews and other prisoners. (160)</p><p>After German capitulation in 1945, Farben fell under the control of the occupying forces. Convinced that Farben's global network of subsidiaries and interests remained a threat to the free world, OMGUS set out immediately to dismantle the company. (161) In 1947, twenty-four Farben executives were tried for war crimes at Nuremberg; among them, nine defendants were ultimately found guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity through the plunder of public and private property in territories that came under German occupation, and five found guilty of enslavement and deportation for slave labor of civilians. (162) In 1951, Farben was split into three large companies--Bayer, Hoechst, and BASF--and six smaller firms. (163) The pre-1904 market was largely recreated, with substantial adjustments for the passage of time. (164)</p><p>The cooption of monopoly firms as agents of the Nazi regime was not limited to firms of enormous scale like Farben. The Third Reich selected even smaller-scale business partners that could exercise exclusive control over industrial segments important to the regime's goals, and it then ensured the perpetuation and deepening of those firms' monopoly power. For instance, the Degussa chemical firm was one-tenth the size of Farben, but it played a significant role in the Nazi's rearmament project and in the plundering of precious metals from the Jews. (165) From its incorporation in 1873 through the Weimar period, Degussa was largely a niche player in precious metals and specialty chemical products. (166) In the late 1920s and early '30s, Degussa made a number of strategic acquisitions to strengthen its position in precious metals and also to diversify into niche product lines like carbon black, an additive that could be used to increase the durability of rubber tires. (167) In 1933, Degussa leveraged Nazi threats against Jewish-owned firms to buy up Degea AG, the leading producer of gas masks and radioactive earth metals, at the same time that the Nazi regime issued decrees to eliminate competition with Degussa in its carbon black development project. (168) The deeper Degussa became intermeshed with the Nazi regime, the more it became an arm of Nazi industrial and political policy, eschewing even more lucrative product lines to focus on the Nazis' priorities. (169)</p><p>By 1937-1938, Degussa was a full-fledged participant in the Nazis' atrocities, plundering Jewish-owned firms to increase its holdings and processing gold, silver, and platinum seized from Jews in Germany. (170) Even though the profit margins from performing the processing function were initially very low, Degussa took on this function in order to preserve its dominance in previous metals and, hence, its position in the Nazi industrial hierarchy. (171) From 1939 to 1941, Degussa processed 80 percent of the gold seized from German and Austrian Jews and shared over 50 percent of other precious metals as well. (172) Thereafter, its dominant position reinforced, the firm took an even larger role in processing precious metals seized from occupied territories. (173) With Farben, Degussa also took part in the manufacture of Zyklon B and the use of slave labor. (174)</p><p>The chemical industry was a backbone of the Third Reich. Its extreme economic concentration facilitated Hitler's consolidation of political power, wars of aggression, and atrocities.</p><p>2. Electricity</p><p>Like the chemical industry, the electrical industry played a significant role in Germany's industrial development during the early twentieth century, and it too transitioned from a competitive market to an oligopoly dominated by two large firms--Siemens and Allgemeine Elektricitats Gesellschaft (AEG). (175) An economic crisis in 1901-1902 took a particularly harsh toll on the electricity industry and enabled Siemens and AEG to gobble up a number of distressed firms or jointly liquidate their smaller rivals in order to clear the market. (176) Siemens and AEG emerged from this period of intensive consolidation with a combined share approaching two-thirds of the market. (177) In the years leading up to the First World War, both firms continued to acquire rival firms, thus solidifying their position of dominance. (178) During the Depression, Siemens and AEG bought up yet additional failing rivals or, as during the 1901-1902 crisis, jointly liquidated them. (179) The two firms held serious discussions about a potential merger, but were ultimately unable to come to agreement. (180) Even without integration through merger, AEG and Siemens quickly grew to a tremendous scale. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Siemens employed 187,000 workers, making it among the top five largest firms in the world. (181) By 1944, AEG and its subsidiaries employed more than 200,000 workers. (182)</p><p>In addition to consolidation through acquisition or joint liquidation, the electrical industry achieved anticompetitive coordination through cartels that fixed prices and imposed marketing quotas on a wide variety of electricity-related submarkets. (183) For example, a 1903 cartel agreement between Siemens, AEG, and F&amp;G-Lahmeyer committed the firms to a secret \"business sharing\" arrangement where the firms essentially agreed not to compete against one another in bids to public works or industrial plants. (184) Siemens and AEG also entered into a variety of bilateral cooperation agreements, including the opening of several jointly owned subsidiaries, (185) and worked together to undermine or weaken smaller rivals that had reached a level of production that threatened the two big firms. (186) At its height, Siemens participated in more than one thousand foreign and domestic cartel agreements. (187)</p><p>The House of Siemens did not welcome Hitler's rise to power. Carl Friedrich von Siemens, the family patriarch, supported the democratic German People's Party up through the March 1933 elections--several months after Hitler had assumed the chancellorship--and the family thereafter participated reluctantly in the Nazi regime. (188) Still, the highly concentrated structure of the electrical industry--produced through decades of mergers, liquidation of rivals, and cartel activity--facilitated the Nazis' projects of centralizing political and economic power and rearming Germany for wars of aggression. The Nazis quickly seized on the consolidated and cartelized structure of the electrical industry to force it within the party's control and reorient the industry to remilitarization. (189) In November of 1933, the Nazis reconstituted the Zentralverband de Deutschen Elektrotechnischen Industrie (Central Association of the German Electrical Industry, or ZVEI)--the association of electrical industry cartels formed in 1918--into the Reichsfachverband Elektroindustrie (RFE), effectively transforming the cartel umbrella organization into an organ of the regime. (190) Through this means and a succession of additional decrees in 1934 and 1935, the Nazi brought the cartels under the direct control of the regime and ensured that \"[t]he self-governing industrial bodies were to feel responsible for ensuring that the cartels, in all the measures they took, adhered to the economic policy of the Reich government.\" (191)</p><p>Chief among the regime's policies was rearmament, and the cartelized electrical industry quickly bent to the regime's will. As the Nazis increasingly employed the preexisting cartel structure to remove \"production and sales ... from the sphere of entrepreneurial decision making\" and prevent \"[t]he possibilities of pursuing an autonomous corporate policy,\" electrical \"[c]ompanies were increasingly less able to resist integration in rearmament and the war economy.\" (192) Although political support for Hitler varied within the German electrical industry as it did throughout many other facets of German society, the concentrated and cartelized structure of the industry offered the Nazis an organizational structure that facilitated the consolidation of economic--and hence political--power and the push toward the war.</p><p>With the advent of war, AEG, like Farben, used its close connections with the military to seize firms in occupied territory. (193) It also employed slave labor, about which reparations litigation has occurred in recent decades. (194) And, like Farben, cartel agreements with U.S. electrical companies undermined U.S. war readiness. Siemens's refusal to honor the terms of a patent exchange agreement with California-based Bendix Aviation Company \"seriously handicapped the production of electrically-driven automatic pilots in the U.S.,\" and a separate cartel agreement with Beryllium Corporation of New York \"resulted in limitation of defense production in the U.S.\" (195)</p><p>The electrical industry differed structurally from the chemical industry--it was characterized by duopoly rather than monopoly and relied extensively on cartelization to achieve economic control. Its industrial captains were slower to lend aid to the Nazis than their peers in the chemical industry. Nonetheless, as in the chemical industry, the industry's concentrated structure was easily coopted to bolster Hitler's political and economic strength and hence facilitated Germany's transformation from democracy to totalitarianism.</p><p>3. Armaments</p><p>At the Nuremberg Military Tribunal, Justice Robert Jackson indicted the Krupp steel and armaments concern as key supporters of the Nazi regime and its wars of aggression:</p><p>Four generations of the Krupp family have owned and operated the great armament and munitions plants which have been the chief source of Germany's war suppliers. For over 130 years this family has been the focus, the symbol, and the beneficiary of the most sinister forces engaged in menacing the peace of Europe. (196)</p><p>Although the firm patriarch was too mentally infirm to stand trial, most of Krupp's directors were convicted for employing slave labor and plundering occupied Europe in a subsequent war crimes trial. (197) But though Krupp surely deserved blame for its conduct during the war, the family firm's attitude toward both cartelization and the Nazi regime was significantly different from those of Farben and Siemens. In assessing the relationship between German industrial concentration and the rise of fascism, it is important to avoid painting all firms and industries with a broad brush, as often occurs when histories are being contested. Krupp's dominance in the armaments industry surely facilitated Hitler's aggressive rearmament policies, but in some very different ways than Siemens or Farben.</p><p>Krupp's transition from a steel company to an armaments company in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries reflects the limits of the cartelization-and-merger story to explain the concentration of German industry and the need to identify additional sources of economic concentration, such as long-term exclusive or semi-exclusive governmental procurement relationships. On the one hand, the Krupp firm was generally averse to participation in cartel agreements. Firm patriarch Alfred Krupp once remarked: \"I hate the idea of fraternization with our competitors, since nobody will do anything for us, and everyone just wants to derive some benefits from such fraternization.\" (198) The firm also resisted pressure to merge with other firms, preferring the independence of the family-owned tradition, (199) and declined to join the steel trust in the mid-1920s. (200) On the other hand, in eschewing anticompetitive collusion and merger, the Krupp firm steered toward a different strategy to avoid direct competition: moving away from homogenous mass-market products subject to intense price competition and toward cultivation of markets subject to long-term exclusivity and guarantees, namely military contracting. (201) In the run-up to the First World War, the firm engaged in intensive, arguably cutthroat, competition to expand its market share in the supply of munitions and artillery products to the German army. 202 When a rival firm attempted to sell a hydraulic recoil gun to the army, Krupp asked the army for an exclusive contract, including lodging an appeal with Wilhelm II. (203) When this gambit failed, Krupp secretly bought up shares of the rival firm in order to hamper its investment ability. (204) By the First World War, the German army had become so reliant on Krupp to supply heavy artillery that Krupp had a near-monopoly. (205)</p><p>The Treaty of Versailles and its implementing agreements required German demilitarization and for Krupp to exit the arms business. (206) On the surface, Krupp shifted back towards its mid-nineteenth century roots in manufacturing finished commercial products like railway cars, but almost immediately it began a secret campaign to retain its arms-building capacity, with the sanction of the German army. (207) By the mid-1920s, Krupp had furtively developed \"eight types of heavy artillery, howitzers, and light field guns; a new, mobile 21-cm. mortar; and the tank family.\" (208) Years before the Nazis' first electoral successes, the House of Krupp had been mass producing tanks for the German army and tightening its grip as the monopoly supplier of German arms and as one of the largest firms in the world. (209) At Hitler's ascension, the head of the Krupp family bragged that he \"had the honor to report to the Fuhrer that Krupp stood ready after a short warm-up to begin the rearmament of the German people without any gaps of experience.\" (210)</p><p>This is not to say that Krupp immediately supported the Nazis--despite the financial benefits of remilitarization, the family was initially skeptical of Hitler. (211) George Hallgarten has observed that family-owned enterprises like Krupp were significantly less likely to support Hitler than were widely held firms: \"It would appear that the old industrial families of the Ruhr feared Hitler's budding totalitarianism much more strongly than did the directors of the anonymous companies who live on big salaries, instead of on individual profits.\" (212) Still, Krupp broke for Hitler before he came into office, probably sometime after the November 1932 elections. (213) On February 20, 1933, the senior Krupp, Gustav, attended the previously mentioned meeting with Hitler and Goring, at the conclusion of which he donated a million reichmarks to the Nazis and organized the collection of two million more from other industrialists. (214) Thereafter Gustav Krupp became a leading fundraiser for the Nazi Party. (215)</p><p>In the years following 1933, Krupp worked closely with the Nazi regime and the German army and navy on rearmament, not only filling orders for its own products but also leveraging its financial strength to spur rearmament more generally. For instance, in 1934, it participated with four other large firms (including Siemens) in the creation of the Metallurgische Forschunggesellschaft, which provided creditworthy signatures permitting the Reichsbank to discount armament bills. (216) The Krupp firm became an organizational spearhead for the Nazi's rearmament project and the Nazification of German industry; for example, it required all of its workers to demonstrate allegiance to Hitler by performing the Nazi salute. (217)</p><p>Krupp also directed its efforts to neutralizing technological development by foreign firms that might develop technologies important to waging war. In 1941, the United States Justice Department brought an antitrust case against General Electric (GE) and Krupp, alleging that the firms had colluded in 1938 to monopolize worldwide production and sale of carboloy, a trade name for tungsten carbide. (21) 8 The case was suspended during the war but eventually went to trial in 1947, with the Krupp firm under control of the U.S. occupation authorities. (219) Despite the suspension of the antitrust case, the Senate Patents Committee held hearings in April of 1942, in which GE was accused of participating in a conspiracy that led to a \"drastic shortage\" of carboloy, which was freely available in Germany. (220) Ostensibly settling patent infringement claims, Krupp and GE had agreed to divide up the world markets for carboloy, with GE getting the United States and Canada and Krupp the rest of the world. (221) Throughout the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that the market division agreement had led to price increases and losses of American jobs. (222) The trial also underscored the importance of carboloy to the war effort and the deleterious effects of its limited availability in the United States during the war: one witness testified that a tool edged with tungsten carbonite could be used one thousand times before it had to be reground compared to one hundred times for other tools. (223) By contrast, \"without [carboloy,] the German military machine could not have been built in the time that it was built and in the efficient fashion that it was built.\" (224) The district court ultimately found GE liable and imposed a relatively small corporate fine. (225)</p><p>Krupp's path to dominance looks very different from Farben's or Siemens's. A family-run business to the end, it was enamored neither of merger nor cartelization. Nonetheless, its position of dominance also served Hitler's nefarious purposes and contributed to the rise of the Third Reich.</p><p>These case studies of Farben-Degussa, Siemens-AEG, and Krupp demonstrate both heterogeneity and commonality when it comes to characterizing the relationship between German cartels and monopolies and the rise of the Third Reich. The firms had different corporate structures, attitudes toward competition, and receptivity to Hitler, and they obtained their market dominance in different ways. None of them instigated Hitler's rise to power. Yet the concentrated market power that characterized each of their industries facilitated Hitler's ascension to totalitarianism and his wars of aggression while undermining U.S. war readiness. The Section that follows subjects the raw historical facts just discussed to a variety of analytical questions, such as the degree to which industrial concentration \"caused\" Hitler, whether the problem was large corporate scale or market power in an economic sense, and by what mechanisms industrial concentration may have facilitated Hitler's rise and consolidation of power.</p><p>III. CAUSATION, MECHANISMS, AND QUESTIONS OF SCALE AND POWER</p><p>A. Four Analytical Questions</p><p>The previous Section showed that industrial cartels and monopolies played a significant role in Hitler's consolidation of power, in Germany's wars of aggression, and in the evils perpetrated by the Nazi regime. But it does not necessarily follow that the concentration of German industry is causally related to the rise of fascism--or that monopoly enabled Nazism. Four matters should give us pause before making such an inference.</p><p>First, we should dispense at the outset with the strongest version of the causation argument: that industrial concentration is the root cause of Nazism--as some of the previously cited political rhetoric suggests. In drawing morals from the history of fascism for current antitrust policy, skeptics frequently note that a large number of complex social, political, economic, and ideological factors lie at the root of Nazism, (226) and that reducing the story to \"monopoly caused Hitler\" is overly simplistic. (227) Of course, these critics are right--industrial concentration was only one of many factors that contributed to the rise of Third Reich. The burden of this paper is not to prove any particular version of causation--\"but for,\" proximate, necessary and sufficient, substantial, contributing, etc. Rather, it is to show that the high concentration of the German economy facilitated Hitler's rise to power, consolidation of power, and wars of aggression. Had economic power in critical industries been significantly more dispersed, it would have been considerably more difficult for the Nazis to obtain such an inexorable grip on all aspects of German society once they came to political power in 1933.228 Whether or not monopolies and cartels \"caused\" Hitler, they facilitated his rise and consolidation of power.</p><p>Second, the direction of causation requires further specification. Did preexisting monopoly conditions in the German industry precipitate the initial rise of Nazism, or did ascendant Nazism promote monopoly? In other words, were monopoly and cartelization causes or symptoms of German fascism? The answer, in short, is that the monopolization and cartelization of the German economy preceded the Nazis by several decades. Although the Nazis certainly furthered and deepened the concentration of economic power after 1933, (229) as shown in Section II.A, the stage was fully set by 1933. For example, Farben's chemical monopoly did not come about as a facet of national industrial policy during wartime. (230) Rather, the cartel preceded World War I by a decade and the merger-to-monopoly process preceded the Second World War by fifteen years.</p><p>However, that the Nazis made such a priority of furthering industrial concentration and consolidation as a key facet of their economic, political, social, and military policy also speaks to the relevance of the pre-Nazi monopolization and cartelization of the German economy as a factor in facilitating the Nazis' rise to power. According to the Decartelization Branch's report Germany's Major Industrial Combines, \"the structural changes that took place after 1933 would seem to indicate that there was scarcely any economic or political measure, no matter what its ostensible aim, that did not ultimately result in the increased concentration and centralization of industrial and political power.\" (231) Further, the Nazi Party and bureaucracy displayed a strong preference for dealing with a single business or small handful of businesses per industry, consistently directing procurement and patronage to monopoly or dominant firms. (232) Fascist governments in Italy and Japan also tended to consolidate political power by consolidating and concentrating industry. (233) The fact that the Nazis pushed concentration and monopolization as part of their industrial and political strategy suggests that an already-concentrated, monopolized, and cartelized economy was congenial to the character of the Nazi regime at the time of its ascension. (234)</p><p>Third, economic concentration could have facilitated the German war effort without necessarily facilitating fascism per se. Characteristically of the German businessmen tried at Nuremberg for war crimes, the I.G. Farben executives vigorously objected that they had acted only as patriotic businessmen serving their country during wartime, just as their counterparts did in Allied territory. (235) Though gigantic, Farben remained smaller than three American industrial concerns--General Motors, U.S. Steel, and Standard Oil. (236) Nor was Farben's wartime market power exceptional. During both World Wars, the United States largely suspended the antitrust laws in war-critical industries in order to mobilize economically and militarily. (237) During the First World War, the federal government relaxed antitrust enforcement to permit competitor collaborations and suspended pending antitrust cases against U.S. Steel, Eastman Kodak, American Can, and International Harvester. (238) President Wilson opined that \"to vindicate the [antitrust] law, [it] would disorganize industry.\" (239) During the Second World War, the Roosevelt administration issued grants of formal immunization to permit otherwise anticompetitive activities supporting the war effort, allowed small firms to pool resources, allowed the Secretaries of War and Navy a veto over antitrust prosecutions, and tolled over thirty antitrust cases. (240) Even the previously mentioned prosecution of Standard Oil for its participation in the JASCO debacle was ordered tolled at the instance of the War Department in order to allow Standard to focus on the war effort, as was the case against General Electric and Krupp. (241) That the U.S. government viewed some degree of enhanced industrial concentration and collaboration as critical to the war effort suggests that such relaxation of competition norms and increases in market power may be endemic to war efforts in general, whether in the service of liberal democracy or its regrettable alternatives.</p><p>Fourth, and perhaps most importantly for present purposes, there is a question of whether the industrial factor that facilitated the rise of Nazism was \"bigness\" or market power. Corporate size is distinct from market power in the sense in which economists and antitrust lawyers use that term--as the power to raise price above a competitive level and exclude competitors. (242) A firm of tremendous size may have little market power, and a relatively small firm may have significant market power. The distinction between market power and corporate bigness has long been understood, and it has been consequential to antitrust law. In 1952, future Nobel Laureate George Stigler drew a distinction between two meanings of \"bigness\" in business: \"First, bigness may be defined in terms of the company's share of the industry in which it operates .... Second, bigness may mean absolute size--the measure of size being assets, sales, or employment as a rule.\" (243) He added that antitrust law deals adequately with the first phenomenon but \"cannot cope effectively with the problem posed by big business.\" (244) Even during the era in which Brandeisian views largely prevailed in the Supreme Court, mere corporate bigness was not sufficient to constitute an antitrust offense. (245) Still, though modern antitrust law distinguishes between size and power, strands of antitrust ideology have at times been concerned with sheer scale, as reflected in the Brandeisian concept of \"the Curse of Bigness.\" When Berle and Means warned in 1932 that \"[t]he rise of the modern corporation has brought a concentration of economic power which can compete on equal terms with the modern state,\" (246) their supporting data tables largely demonstrated corporate size as represented by such factors as gross assets, cash positions, and proportions of securities issued. (247) Thus, it is important to be clear in specifying whether it was the sheer scale of industrial firms, or the market power they held in a contemporary microeconomic sense, that played the vital role in facilitating the Third Reich.</p><p>The remainder of this Part responds to issues three and four--facilitating war versus facilitating fascism, and bigness versus market power--by distilling the mechanisms of facilitation.</p><p>B. The Mechanisms by Which Industrial Concentration and Cartelization Enabled Nazism</p><p>The German Weimar economy was undoubtedly characterized by high levels of concentration and cartelization, and Hitler utilized the dominant firms and cartels to his advantage, but that alone does not demonstrate that extreme economic concentration facilitated extreme political concentration. Without identified mechanisms of influence, the relationship between industrial concentration and political concentration may reflect correlation rather than causation. This Part identifies five mechanisms by which Germany's extreme economic concentration facilitated Hitler's consolidation of political power.</p><p>1. Monopoly Profits and the Faustian Bargain</p><p>Historians who debate the extent to which big business support was important to Hitler's rise to power often focus on financial donations to the Nazi Party. A U.S. Senate report charged that \"Krupp, Thyssen and other powerful figures on the German industrial scene provided the Nazis with indispensable financial and political support.\" (248) On the other hand, many historians argue that most of the pre-1933 donations from big business were token amounts given on the same basis as donations to political parties across the spectrum and did little to aid Hitler's ascent to power. (249) As previously noted, donations from big industry picked up significantly in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor and arguably helped to \"consolidate Hitler's rule.\" (250)</p><p>In judging the importance of big industry's financial donations and other forms of material support to the Nazis, it is important to bear in mind that Hitler did not achieve full consolidation of political power immediately upon his appointment as chancellor on January 30, 1933. The Nazis controlled only three out of eleven cabinet posts and continued to require the legislative support of the Center Party and the Conservatives for the passage of the Enabling Act of March 23, 1933, which granted the Reich cabinet \"temporary\" ruling powers for an ostensible period of four years. (251) Even after the abolition of political parties other than the Nazis on July 14, 1933 and the Reichstag's effective abdication, Paul von Hindenburg, as president, remained commander-in-chief of the military and held the power to negotiate foreign treaties until his death in August of 1934. (252) It was not until soldiers were required to swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler on August 20, 1934, over a year and half after his ascension as chancellor, that Hitler achieved full dictatorial power over Germany. (253) Hitler's plenary control over industry arguably preceded his plenary control over the army.</p><p>Moreover, as Hallgarten observes, the significance of big industry's financial contributions to the Nazis in the critical years of his ascension lies in much more than the immediate impact on filling the party's coffers:</p><p>While Hitler was strongly assisted by the industrialists' funds, one cannot say that industry \"made\" his movement. A movement of such enormous size as his which in 1932 controlled 230 seats in the Reichstag, is not made by any individual or group. It might be more correct to state that heavy industry by its very existence and social nature caused the movement, or, at least, helped to cause it and once it was given birth tried to use it for the industrialists' purposes. Mechanization and economic concentration, maintenance of monopoly prices and monopoly agreements, with the resulting pressure on small competitors, were the fertile ground on which mass fascism grew. (254)</p><p>The significance of financial contributions by the monopolists and cartelists from 1933 forward cannot be measured solely in terms of enabling the Nazi Party's financial activities. More importantly, the donations evidence big industry's willingness to strike a Faustian bargain with the Nazi regime, in which the captains of industry would support the regime not only with their pocketbooks but also through a variety of other organizational, political, and economic mechanisms in exchange for the party's favor and furtherance of their market dominance. That big industry may have come into the Nazi fold grudgingly does not negate the fact that, when the political winds turned and Hitler's long-term political dominance seemed likely, the concentrated structure of German industry produced the Faustian bargain--the exchange of continued monopoly rents for the support of a political regime that big industry was not otherwise inclined to favor.</p><p>The case of German fascism may be a vivid illustration of what economist Luigi Zingales has called a \"Medici vicious circle\" (based on a case study of the Medici dynasty in medieval Florence), \"in which money [derived from monopoly profits] is used to gain political power and political power is then used to make more money.\" (255) Zingales argues that monopolists have a unique ability to capture politics over the long term based on (1) their ability to make credible long-term promises; (2) their grip on the market for specific human capital; (3) their ability to wrap their self-interest in \"a bigger, noble[] idea\"; and (4) the social control they acquire through their image in society as it affects employment, data ownership, media ownership, advertising, research funding, and other methods. (256) In 1933, German heavy industry had already accumulated significant economic and political power through consolidation and cartelization. Hitler's rise simultaneously threatened the persistence of the industrialists' monopoly rents and created an opportunity to retain and even grow those rents in the future through increased state patronage and national rearmament. By casting their lot with Hitler in 1933, the monopolies and cartels were spending some of the income earned from their existing monopoly status to buy political power in the rising regime. In coming years, the monopolies and cartels would spend their political capital to earn even greater monopoly rents--an outcome clearly evidenced by their soaring profits in the later years of the Nazi regime. (257)</p><p>To understand the significance of monopoly power to this Faustian bargain, it may be helpful to imagine a counterfactual situation in which the German economy was significantly less concentrated at the time of Hitler's ascension to power. Smaller individual firms in unconcentrated markets might still have been willing to make the Faustian bargain--support for the regime in exchange for economic privileges--but the bargain would have been much harder to strike or enforce because the mutual gains would have been significantly more difficult to assure. A small business firm in an unconcentrated market would not have the financial or other economic resources to offer the regime in its quest to centralize power. Nor could the regime as easily promise smaller firms long-run monopoly profits, which would require suppressing many competitor firms capable of mounting robust political and economic opposition. As previously noted, Hitler's initial political support was far deeper among small-scale businesspeople who felt threatened by the power of the cartels and monopolies, (258) but it was to those cartels and monopolies that Hitler turned when he sought to consolidate his power and arm for war. The exchange of material support from monopolies for the promise of continued and deepened monopoly power depends on the preexistence of monopoly power and the regime's ability to credibly promise its continuation. Those were the circumstances of Germany in 1933.</p><p>2. Organizational Structure, Industry-Wide Mobilization, and Dissemination of Propaganda</p><p>Beyond cash payments to finance the Nazis directly, which may nor may not have been critical to the Nazis in the years of their ascendance, the Faustian bargain manifested itself in forms of organizational, industrial, and political support that were of immense help to Hitler as he worked to consolidate power after his ascension as chancellor. Monopoly business firms were ideally positioned to facilitate the rapid consolidation of political power by lending the Nazi Party an organizational and bureaucratic structure at a time when the party was not yet in full control of either the political or military bureaucracy. For instance, once Farben's senior managers had made a bet that alliance with Hitler was critical to the firm's long-run profitability (particularly given the immense commercial benefits that would come to a chemical monopoly from a program of rearmament and industrial-military independence), they effectively put the firm and its resources at Hitler's disposal--with the understanding, of course, that the firm would be allowed to cash in financially by serving as a military-economic arm of the state. (259) Thus developed a codependent relationship between the firm and the regime. Over time, the firm became evermore organizationally intermeshed with the Wehrmacht and took on many economy-wide planning functions characteristic of governmental bureaucracies. (260) With fewer internal checks and balances to overcome than in the political and military spheres, a massive organization that already, by virtue of its monopoly position, controlled large swaths of the German economy was a prime vehicle for a rising political force eager to centralize power.</p><p>More generally, once the Faustian bargain had been struck, the great industrial monopolies were well-positioned to begin carrying out the Nazi regime's economic, political, and social policies with immediate and far-reaching effect. These policies included such measures as purging Jews from senior management positions, reorienting industries toward rearmament, achieving German industrial independence, and spreading Nazi propaganda. Having signed onto the Nazi regime, the monopolies were able to begin advancing these policies across hundreds of thousands of employees and entire industries spread throughout Germany.</p><p>In many cases, the Nazis allowed the bureaucratic and managerial functions assigned to the monopolies and cartels during the early days of the regime to continue even after the Nazis had secured plenary political power. A U.S. War Department study submitted to Congress found that the Nazi apparatus never achieved an economic organizational superstructure independent of the dominant business firms assigned to run the major sectors of the German economy and that the Nazis were economically \"helpless\" with out the bureaucratic structure of the firms themselves. (261) The Nazis built up their own \"army and police and spy system\" but relied heavily on the centralized power of their corporate partners to administer the regime's economic policies. (262) \"[T]he bureaucratic structure itself was controlled by an oligarchy consisting of the chief stockholders of the great combines, the political hierarchy, and the military High Command.\" (263) Often the captains of industry were given official governmental titles so that they could run economic functions officially from within their own firm structures. The head of I.G. Farben held the position of National Deputy for Chemicals, and the chairman of the coordinating organization of coal cartels was also given the title National Deputy and ran the coal industry through the offices of the Ruhr coal syndicate. (264)</p><p>The role of big industry in propagating Nazi propaganda and coercing allegiance to the Nazi cause was also important to the regime. Farben played a significant role as an incubator and disseminator of Nazi propaganda. The firm employed 120,000 people (265) and owned a number of newspapers, (266) which allowed the firm to spread Nazi propaganda in Germany and around the world. (267) Although senior Farben managers continued to have private qualms about the Nazi regime, (268) the firm sprang into action to ensure ideological purity and adherence to the regime among its workforce. On May Day--May 1--1933, Farben lined up its plant workers to hear Nazi speeches and give \"Sig Heil\" chants. (269) Similarly, as of August 1933, all workers in Krupp factories were required to give the Nazi salute; any who refused were terminated. (270) Once the dominant firms had bet on Hitler, they were able to serve as channels of his policies and ideology with greater alacrity than many other institutions of German society.</p><p>3. Cartelization and Political Control</p><p>In a September 1944 letter to Secretary of State Cordell Hull, President Roosevelt observed that German \"cartels were utilized by the Nazis as government instrumentalities to achieve political ends.\" (271) Thurman Arnold, a Yale law professor and Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, echoed similar themes in his 1943 introduction to a book by two federal officials on Hitler's use of Germany's cartels, observing that \"the vast centralized cartel organization of Germany became a tool in the hands of a dictator who no longer operated for private profit but solely to serve a ruthless ambition.\" (272) Although some of this rhetoric was directed at drumming up domestic opposition to the cartelization of the U.S. economy rather than providing a sober assessment of Germany, the basic point was correct: the existence of German cartels greatly facilitated Hitler's goal of achieving plenary political control over the German economy and reorienting it for war. (273)</p><p>As noted supra in Section II.A, the German economy was subject to an increasing pattern of cartelization from the Imperial period up through the Weimar period, to the point that, with the Nazi ascendancy, cartels permeated the German economy. The Nazis quickly turned the cartelized structure of the German economy to their own ends. A decree of July 15, 1933 amended the 1923 permit decree to centralize power over cancellation of cartel agreements in the minister of economics, which \"made possible a more effective integration of state control over cartels and general economic policy.\" (274) A second decree the same day authorized the minister of economics to create compulsory cartels--essentially allowing the Reich government to force firms to participate in cartels. (275) Little by little, the government employed these powers to bring industry firmly under state control and transform the cartels into \"agents of a totalitarian government.\" (276)</p><p>The Nazis used the reinforced cartel structure pervading the German economy as a means to achieve total control over every aspect of German industry. A decree of November 12, 1936 integrated the cartels into the state's administrative hierarchy and charged administrative groups with regulating the German markets through the means of the cartels. (277) This administrative structure also served as one of the Nazis' chief means of orchestrating business surveillance. The groups were charged with maintaining nonpublic registers of the cartels' existence, composition, area, membership, and duties and reporting any market-regulating activities contemplated by the cartels. (278) The Decartelization Branch observed that \"[i]n a war economy, the ability to deal with a few large organizations in possession of detailed information concerning all the various aspects of production and distribution is of inestimable advantage--as the Nazis were quick to realize.\" (279) Similarly, writing in 1957, German scholar Ivo Schwartz summarized the Nazi appropriation of Germany's highly cartelized economy as follows:</p><p>Cartels proved themselves a very appropriate device to increase the power of the totalitarian system. By law the Reich Minister of Economics was authorized to establish compulsory cartels in any branch of industry or, by executive decree, to compel outsiders to join cartels already existing. Compulsory and free cartels were used to establish and maintain price, raw material and production controls as introduced by the government. Finally, they were used to strengthen the government-planned war industry. At the beginning of World War II, German industry was highly cartelized and concentrated, and completely in the hands of the Nazi administration. (280)</p><p>The Nazis succeeded in centralizing political power over German industry by appropriating a decades-long tradition of industrial cartelization as the launchpad of a state-directed and state-controlled economy. (281) Although the Nazis possibly could have achieved economy-wide cartelization on their own initiative from scratch, the existing cartel structure greatly expedited their campaign to achieve total control over the German economy. Significantly, this power-consolidating effect arose not so much from corporate \"bigness\" as from a culture of business collusion rather than competition. Many of the cartels included scores of smaller or medium-sized firms. (282) The Nazis effectively used their mutual interdependence through the medium of anticompetitive agreements as a lever to exert political control over entire industries.</p><p>4. National Champions and the Military-Industrial Complex</p><p>As applied to German fascism, the classic version of the \"military-industrial complex,\" of which President Eisenhower would warn in his valedictory address in 1961, (283) holds that German industrial monopolies that would profit from rearmament and war propelled Hitler to power. As previously discussed, this characterization of heavy industry's support for Hitler during the Weimar period is doubtful. (284) Still, that big industry was initially reluctant to support the Fuhrer does not mean that the highly concentrated structure of German industry critical to rearmament played no role in Hitler's rise. The previously described Faustian bargain depends not on industry having been enthusiastic for Hitler's rise but on it having the incentive to pledge loyalty to a regime whose consolidation of power seemed imminent and who could promise war profits in exchange for the monopolies' support. Once convinced that Hitler was in power for the long term and that this meant an opportunity to grow monopoly profits, firms like Farben had the capacity to \"creat[e] an infrastructure that would allow it to respond directly to the government's demands for strategic autarky--in effect, taking a leading role in getting Germany ready for war.\" (285)</p><p>Moreover, the monopolies were in a unique position to play the role of \"national champions\" neutralizing or pacifying foreign rivals' efforts at developing products critical for war. As noted in the earlier case studies, Farben, Siemens, and Krupp were each involved in market allocation agreements with U.S. firms that the Nazi regime used to impede American development in war-critical product lines: Farben with Standard Oil as to buna rubber, (286) Siemens with Bendix as to automatic pilots and as to beryllium with Beryllium Corp., (287) and Krupp with General Electric as to carboloy. (288) A 1941 Congressional Research Service report on foreign control of U.S. patents found numerous other instances in which German firms were able to limit the availability of defense-related materials in the United States because of market division agreements under color of patent law with U.S. firms. (289) Although some of the market division agreements predated the Nazis, the Nazi regime made strategic use of them to prevent U.S. firms from developing indigenous technologies that could replace German-made products during wartime. The regime's capacity to use its national champion firms in this way to centralize its global political and military power was only possible because Germany had national champion firms--that is, firms with a position of domestic dominance tolerated and encouraged by the regime as instruments of foreign policy.</p><p>5. Decline of Democracy Within the Firm</p><p>A final potential mechanism by which the concentration of economic power facilitated the concentration of political power in Nazi Germany concerns the decline of democracy within the firms themselves in parallel with the decline of democracy in the surrounding political sphere. As firms that once replicated forms of democracy--or at least the dispersion of authority--internally began to serve the regime's goals of concentrating political power, it was not long until power within the firm had to be centralized as well. Once the firms became intermeshed with the hierarchical and centralized power structure of the state, democracy within the firm could not long survive. The decline of democracy within the firm, in turn, furthered the regime's power-centralizing goals in society generally.</p><p>Consider the symbiotic effects of the relationship between I.G. Farben and the Nazi regime and the resulting loss of checks and balances--of democratic features--within the Farben organization itself. In 1937-1938, as Farben was becoming increasingly an arm of the regime, the company reorganized to centralize power in a few senior managers: forty-six once-distinct subsidiaries were absorbed into the main enterprise, the number of managing and supervising board members was reduced, the governing powers of the firm's central committee were largely transferred to the company's president, company minutes and records ceased to be widely circulated, and board members were denied access to financial reports. (290) In short, the firm organizationally replicated many of the democracy-quashing changes occurring in the political regime, with the effect of extending totalitarian control from the political to the business realm.</p><p>Similarly, the Krupp firm also underwent a structural transition under the Nazis in the direction of increasing centralization of power in the Krupp family. Although the Krupp family largely controlled the firm, its corporate form allowed for some degree of influence by external directors. (291) After managerial conflicts arose during the war, Alfried Krupp made a personal appeal to Hitler for the Krupp firm to be reorganized by state decree, arguing that \"the concentration of responsibility in a single head, especially in critical times ... cannot be valued highly enough.\" (292) On November 12, 1943, a Fuhrer decree that became known as \"Lex Krupp\" specified that \"the owner of the Krupp family wealth is empowered to create a family enterprise with a particular regulation of succession.\" (293) The decree resulted in a complete centralization of corporate power in the Krupp family. (294)</p><p>The Nazi regime favored centralization of power within its partner monopoly firms, just as it favored the centralization of power throughout the economy and society more generally. As the regime worked to centralize its own political power, the concentration of economic power in a few dominant firms was congenial to its purposes.</p><p>The beginning of this Section asked whether industrial concentration and cartelization facilitated Germany's war effort or the Nazis per se and whether the problem was really large-scale business or market power in an economic sense. With the mechanisms by which the concentrated and cartelized structure of German industry facilitated Hitler distilled, these questions can now be answered directly, although not necessarily in an unqualified or dogmatic way.</p><p>As to the first question, it is difficult to disentangle Germany's radical rearmament and wars of aggression from the Nazi regime, since forcibly destroying the Treaty of Versailles regime was Hitler's chief political aim. That said, the historical record reveals that German monopolies and cartels played an important role in consolidating Hitler's power and carrying out his policies even apart from the directly military functions--for example, by incubating and disseminating Nazi ideology, purging Jewish managers, and cencentralizing power over industry.</p><p>As to the question of large scale versus market power, it is true that some of the democracy-eroding effects were products of large organizational structure rather than market power in an economic sense. Still, the historical record suggests that it was not just the gigantic size of the Farbens but also the economic dominance of even the much smaller Degussas that made them such convenient vehicles for the rise of Nazism. What Hitler needed in 1933 was firms willing to cut the Faustian bargain with ample cash to bankroll his political regime extragovernmentally, an organizational structure spread throughout German society, and the economic power to drive an entire industry at a dictator's direction. Abnormal financial resources, ubiquitous local presence, and--in particular--the power to direct an entire industry are attributes of monopoly. In 1933, the German economy possessed all of these in large quantities due to a course of economic concentration dating back to Bismarck. Further, the cartel structures that the Third Reich used to control and direct industry, police dissent, and dictate commercial and political uniformity did not require economic bigness in the form of large corporations. Economic interdependence and habituation to concerted action even among smaller firms made the cartels convenient mechanisms for achieving political control over the economy. Market power, whether achieved through merger, monopolistic exclusion, or cartelization, played a distinct role in facilitating the Third Reich.</p><p>IV. WHAT SORT OF ANTITRUST REGIME WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE INDUSTRIAL CONCENTRATION AND CARTELIZATION THAT FACILITATED HITLER'S RISE?</p><p>This final Section turns from historical analysis to use of history for presentist concerns (and hence runs the usual risks of distortion and anachronism). What does the history of early and mid-twentieth century German industrial concentration and fascism mean for contemporary debates over antitrust policy? Nearly forty years ago, Bob Pitofsky wrote, in his classic article The Political Content of Antitrust, that it is \"bad history, bad policy, and bad law to exclude certain political values in interpreting the antitrust laws.\" (295) Pitofsky argued that pervasive monopoly threatened democratic values in three ways:</p><p>[F]irst, ... excessive concentration of economic power will breed antidemocratic political pressures .... [S]econd, ... by [increasing the possibility that] private discretion by a few in the economic sphere controls the welfare of all.... [Third] if the free-market sector of the economy is allowed to develop under antitrust rules that are blind to all but economic concerns, the likely result will be an economy so dominated by a few corporate giants that it will be impossible for the state not to play a more intrusive role in economic affairs. (296)</p><p>Pitofsky cited the history of Nazi Germany and the influence of the decartelization program on the Celler-Kefauver Act in furtherance of his thesis that antitrust policy should not be blind to the political and democratic value of maintaining a deconcentrated industrial sector. (297)</p><p>The historical record of German fascism lends credence to the claim that concentrated economic power fuels concentrated political power, with corrosive effects for democracy. But does it follow that an antitrust regime explicitly focused on political values is necessary for the preservation of democracy, or would an antitrust regime focused on economic values such as preserving allocative efficiency and maximizing consumer welfare serve the same function? Some data relevant to answering these questions can be gathered by subjecting the German story to a counterfactual inquiry that imagines the German economy constrained by contemporary economically oriented antitrust norms. Would the presence of a consumer welfare-oriented antitrust law have prevented the economic dominance of the Farbens, Siemens, and Krupps, and hence the crucial role they played in supporting the rise and evils of Nazism? Yes, even an economically and consumer welfare-oriented antitrust law would have prevented much of the monopolization and cartelization that characterized the German economy in 1933. Prior to reconstruction under the Allies, Germany had no antitrust law--at least none that would be recognizable under contemporary global standards. (298) If it had, the levels of concentration and cartelization that characterized Germany in 1933 would not have been possible.</p><p>Consider Farben's path to monopoly, which consisted of five steps: (1) domestic cartelization, (2) domestic merger to monopoly, (3) international market division, (4) integration with the state, and (5) foreign industrial conquest through economic and military coercion. The first three steps were accomplished prior to the rise of the Nazi regime and put in place the economic and institutional arrangements that Hitler would seize upon in his navigation to power. The second two steps, mediated by the Nazi regime, consolidated and expanded Farben's preexisting power.</p><p>The first three steps present relatively straightforward cases for condemnation under economically oriented antitrust norms. Naked cartel agreements, including the two 1904 pooling arrangements, the 1916 megapool, and the 1926 explosives agreement, are considered per se illegal under contemporary antitrust doctrine. (299) The Justice Department vigorously prosecutes them criminally, yielding billions of dollars in fines and hundreds of years in prison terms. (300) If contemporary antitrust norms had applied to early twentieth-century Germany, the chemical cartel could not lawfully have occurred. By the same token, the vast swath of naked cartel arrangements that permeated German industry would have been unlawful.</p><p>Similarly, the 1925 merger-to-monopoly process that created Farben would almost certainly have been disallowed under consumer welfare-oriented antitrust norms. Although mergers, unlike cartels, are judged under a rule of reason standard rather than a per se rule of illegality, a merger between the nine largest chemical companies in the country, resulting in a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index figure of a perfect 10,000 in many sectors, would almost certainly be prohibited. (301)</p><p>Farben's international market division agreement with Standard Oil presents a somewhat closer case than the domestic cartel agreements and merger to monopoly. Though it involved market division, JASCO nominally advanced two interests recognized as generally procompetitive under contemporary antitrust norms: (1) licensing contested patent rights and (2) pooling economic and technical resources for joint research and development activities. (302) Despite these facially procompetitive effects, the JASCO arrangement would likely fail under contemporary antitrust norms--as it did when challenged by the Justice Department in 1942.303 The sweeping global market division accomplished by the JASCO agreements--allocating entire product segments and the entire globe--quite plainly exceeded the scope of any relevant patent rights, and hence would be considered per se illegal market division under prevailing contemporary norms. (304) Moreover, the \"joint research\" functions of JASCO apparently did not involve much genuine pooling of technical resources by the two companies, as evidenced by the fact that Standard's scientists and engineers were unable to replicate the production of buna without Farben's help until, after the termination of the agreement, they effectively reinvented the wheel. (305) The \"joint study\" arrangement seems to have operated principally as an allocation of buna research and market exploitation to Farben, with a loose expectation that Farben might later enable Standard to enter the field as well. (306) Such an arrangement would also be considered unlawful market division under contemporary antitrust norms, as it was in 1942.307 By the same token, Krupp's market division agreement with American firms under color of patent law was challenged in American court under American antitrust principles. (308)</p><p>The last two steps--integration with the state and foreign conquest--permitted Farben to consolidate and enlarge its preexisting monopoly power under the Third Reich. Contemporary antitrust norms would not likely have been availing to curb these abuses, but not due to antitrust's contemporary economic or consumer welfare orientation. Direct state involvement in the creation of monopoly power generally renders the scheme untouchable under the antitrust laws, not out of solicitude to consumer welfare or efficiency but because of political commitments to federalism and democratic processes. (309) Indeed, it has largely been advocates of the consumer welfare approach that have argued for narrowing state action immunity on the view that states systematically distort competitive processes for the benefit of rent-seekers. (310) As to economic conquests during the war, this facet of Farben's malfeasance is quite obviously beyond the possible scope of any domestic antitrust law. This is not to say that it is untouchable by law more generally. Nine of the Farben defendants were convicted at Nuremberg on the charges of plundering and spoliation of public and private property, (311) and expropriation of property during war remains a serious crime under the Hague Convention. (312)</p><p>In sum, application of contemporary economically oriented antitrust principles could have prevented Farben's rise to dominance in Germany, and hence the exploitation of Farben's monopoly to facilitate Hitler's rise to power. Once the firm and state were organizationally intermeshed and part of a single, lawless program of domestic and international conquest and control, no form of antitrust law--nor any other domestic law--realistically could have arrested their brutal trajectory.</p><p>Application of contemporary antitrust principles could also have prevented the rise to dominance of Siemens and AEG. As noted, the electrical industry achieved its duopolistic concentration through a chain of horizontal mergers, exclusion of rivals, and cartelization, (313) all of which are subject to scrutiny under prevailing antitrust standards.</p><p>It is less clear that application of contemporary antitrust principles would have prevented Krupp from obtaining such a dominant position in the armaments industry. As noted, the Krupp firm eschewed merger and cartelization as devices to achieve market power, preferring instead to curry favor with the military to secure exclusive or semi-exclusive procurement relationships. (314) Exclusivity in military procurement contracts is not free from antitrust review, (315) but the Department of Defense frequently employs sole-source contracting for important weapons programs, and antitrust law does not touch such sovereign decisions of the government. At a time when the number of major U.S. defense contractors continues to dwindle to a small handful with the consent and often encouragement of the military, (316) it would seem self-righteous to proclaim the Krupp story as one that could have been avoided through application of contemporary antitrust law.</p><p>Although much of the monopolistic and cartelizing conduct that facilitated Hitler's rise and consolidation of power would have been illegal under the consumer welfare standard, contemporary antitrust norms would not have prevented all vestiges of market power in the Weimar economy any more than they eliminate all vestiges in the American economy today. Some of the dominance of the large industrial firms in question came about through legitimate means, such as managerial skill or technological innovation--the \"superior skill, foresight and industry\" that Learned Hand famously held off limits to antitrust scrutiny in Alcoa, another wartime antitrust case. (317) And some of the conduct that spurred the big firms to dominance by impairing smaller rivals might today be found to enhance efficiency, and hence not constitute an antitrust violation. Still, the core elements that drove German industry to its concentrated stage in the late Weimar period-- cartelization and merger to monopoly--are paradigmatic instances of conduct prohibited by contemporary antitrust principles. It is therefore fair to say that application of consumer welfare-oriented antitrust principles would have prevented the path that the German economy took to concentration and monopoly in 1933 and beyond.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>Concerns that industrial monopoly and cartelization undermine democracy are not new. Most recently in Western history, such concerns obtained political traction in the wake of the Second World War, to the point that anti-fascism served as a dominant motivation underlying the post-War antitrust regimes in both the United States and Europe. With the ascendancy of calls for a reinvigorated antitrust regime in service of democracy today, it is important to recall the similar conversation that took place in light of fascism's existential threat to the democratic order. The framers of the postWar antitrust regimes in Europe and the United States were convinced that a strong anti-monopoly and anti-cartelization norm was necessary to prevent the reemergence of the sort of consolidated economic power that empowered fascism and threatened democratic liberalism. This Article has presented historical evidence substantiating that concern--demonstrating that industrial concentration and cartelization in Weimar Germany facilitated Hitler's rise and consolidation of political power.</p><p>What contemporary uses should be made of this history? On a scholarly basis, much work remains to be done to establish the general proposition that extreme concentration of economic power tends to facilitate extreme concentrations of political power. The Nazi story, while obviously significant because of Germany's leading role in mid-twentieth-century fascism, is only one piece in the wider story of fascism. Similar inquiries into periods of fascist or quasi-fascist regimes in other nations, including Japan, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, could allow for a more general conclusion about the importance of industrial concentration and cartelization in the rise of fascism. And then there are important questions about the relationship between economic concentration and other forms of totalitarian or highly centralized political power, such as the Stalinist systems about which the framers of the Celler-Kefauver Act worried as the next frontier of monopoly. The idea that concentrated economic power breeds concentrated political power has much rhetorical appeal, but documenting the relationship historically, exploring the variations and mechanisms, and prescribing the particular antidotes remains a largely incomplete project.</p><p>Finally, how should the history of economic concentration in Weimar and Nazi Germany inform current debates over the goals of antitrust law and the direction of antitrust enforcement? This Article has suggested that the chief culprits in the creation of the overly concentrated German economy--cartelization and merger to monopoly--are already prohibited by antitrust's reigning consumer welfare standard. However, those who believe that the U.S. economy is becoming dangerously overly concentrated because the consumer welfare standard has been laxly applied will worry, with Professor Wu, that conditions that facilitated Hitler's rise are being replicated in our economy today. (318) Although I am skeptical that this is the case, that issue is beyond this Article's purview. Rediscovering the voluminous record of concentration and cartelization that facilitated the Nazi regime and diagnosing the mechanisms by which extremely concentrated economic power served to concentrate political power in Nazi Germany lays a foundation for the important policy debates to come about the relationship between democracy and monopoly.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.36644/mlr.118.7.fascism\">https://doi.org/10.36644/mlr.118.7.fascism</url></p><p>Daniel A.

At a theoretical level, structuralism rested on four broad theoretical and empirical propositions. First, the structuralists assumed a strong link between the number of firms in a market and the propensity of prices to rise above cost. This claim rested principally on strong assumptions, formalized by the nineteenth-century French mathematician Augustin Cournot, that oligopoly behavior would increase as the number of firms decreased. Hovenkamp, supra note 50, at 360. The structuralists claimed that the Cournot assumptions were borne out by empirical studies showing that firms in concentrated industries earned higher profits than those in more competitively structured industries. See, e.g., id. at 349-50 (discussing Professor Bain's research agenda around profit and concentration). Second, echoing a theme from Louis Brandeis, the structuralists rejected the notion that large aggregations of capital were necessary to achieving economies of scale. See Crane, supra note 6, at 122. While economies of scale did exist, in many markets the firms were far larger than minimum efficient scale demanded; such markets could be \"deconcentrated\" by breaking up large firms without causing significant production inefficiencies. See Hovenkamp, supra note 50, at 362. Third, the structuralists claimed that barriers to entry were high in many industries, but particularly in those with a large fixed cost component. See id. at 350. The Harvard School's broad definition of entry barriers would raise a strong challenge from the Chicago School, which gave a much narrower definition to entry barriers--with the implication that far fewer markets would be considered difficult to enter. See id. at 361. Fourth, Kaysen-Turner argued that, given the close link between Cournot theory and maximizing behavior, poor performance in highly concentrated markets was inevitable. See id. at 350, 356. As a result, antitrust should focus on structure and pay relatively less attention to conduct.</p><p>(55.) See Hovenkamp, supra note 50, at 351-52.</p><p>(56.)

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p>We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p>We begin with Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p>But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p>But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p>But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p>Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p>I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p>Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p>SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p>If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p>But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p>To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p>That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p>And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p>So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p>So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p>In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p>Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p>Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p>The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p>Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p>Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p>In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p>Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p>Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p>Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p>But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p>Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p>I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p>You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p>And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p>ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p>The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p>But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p>We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p>So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p>What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p>That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p>So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p>But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p>However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p>And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p>And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p>Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p>But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p>It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p>We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p>We will have more after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p>And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p>I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p>QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p>And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p>And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p>And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p>But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p>Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p>Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p>And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p>We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p>Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p>That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p>And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p>And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p>And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p>CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p>But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p>And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p>Am I right?</p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p>We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p>Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p>We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p>But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p>And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p>Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p>And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p>And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p>I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p>There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p>Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p>BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p>Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p>The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p>And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p>A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p>We will explain next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p>Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p>The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p>The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p>Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p>Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p>But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p>We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p>This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p>But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p>Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p>Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p>In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p>Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p>Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p>This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p>And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p>GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p>But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p>And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p>If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p>GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p>And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p>GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p>GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p>And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p>Am I missing something?  </p><p>GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p>I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p>They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p>So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p>Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p>Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p>Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p>The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p>So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p>I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p>The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p>Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p>Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p>I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p>But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p>But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p>So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p>Gianno?  </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p>However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p>You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p>So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p>But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p>And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p>And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p>But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p>There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p>And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p>But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p>Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p>And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p>BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p>That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p>I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p>All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p>By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p>We're on it after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p>They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p>Hey, Susan.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p>As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p>Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p>Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p>But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p>Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p>The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>We will have more right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p>In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p>When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p>PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p>Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p>But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p>PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p>And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p>He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p>You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p>Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p>But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p>To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p>Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p>President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p>But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p>But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p>PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p>All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p>It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p>Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p> We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p> We begin with Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p> But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p> But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p> But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p> Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p> I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p> Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p> SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p> If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p> But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p> To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p> That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p> And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p> So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p> So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p> In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p> Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p> Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p> The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p> Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p> Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p> In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p> Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p> Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p> Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p> But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p> Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p> I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p> You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p> And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p> ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p> The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p> But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p> We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p> So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p> What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p> That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p> So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p> But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p> However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p> And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p> And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p> Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p> But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p> It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p> We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p> And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p> I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p> QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p> QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p> And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p> And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p> And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p> But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p> Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p> Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p> FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p> And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p> We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p> Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p> That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p> And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p> And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p> And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p> CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p> But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p> And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p> Am I right?</p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p> We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p> Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p> Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p> SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p> We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p> But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p> And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p> Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p> And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p> And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p> I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p> There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p> Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p> BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p> CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p> Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p> The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p> And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p> A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p> We will explain next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p> Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p> The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p> The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p> Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p> JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p> Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p> But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p> We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p> This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p> But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p> Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p> Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p> In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p> Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p> Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p> This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p> LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p> And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p> GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p> But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p> And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p> If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p> GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p> And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p> GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p> GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p> And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p> CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p> Am I missing something?  </p><p> GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p> I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p> They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p> So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p> Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p> Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p> Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p> The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p> So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p> I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p> The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p> Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p> Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p> EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p> I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p> But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p> But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p> So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p> Gianno?  </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p> However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p> You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p> So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p> But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p> And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p> And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p> But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p> There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p> And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p> But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p> Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p> And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p> BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p> That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p> I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p> All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p> By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p> We're on it after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p> They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p> Hey, Susan.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p> As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p> Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p> Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p> But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p> Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p> The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p> We will have more right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p> In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p> When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p> PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p> Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p> But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p> And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p> PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p> And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p> He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p> You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p> Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p> But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p> To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p> Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p> President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p> PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p> But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p> But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p> PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p> All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p> It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p> Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p> See you in about three hours.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p> We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p> We begin with Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p> But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p> But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p> But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p> Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p> I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p> Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p> SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p> If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p> But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p> To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p> That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p> And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p> So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p> So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p> In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p> Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p> Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p> The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p> Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p> Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p> In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p> Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p> Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p> Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p> But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p> Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p> I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p> You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p> And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p> ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p> The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p> But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p> We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p> So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p> What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p> That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p> So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p> But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p> However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p> And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p> And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p> Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p> But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p> It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p> We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p> And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p> I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p> QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p> QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p> And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p> And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p> And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p> But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p> Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p> Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p> FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p> And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p> We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p> Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p> That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p> And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p> And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p> And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p> CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p> But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p> And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p> Am I right?</p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p> We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p> Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p> Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p> SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p> We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p> But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p> And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p> Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p> And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p> And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p> I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p> There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p> Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p> BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p> CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p> Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p> The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p> And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p> A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p> We will explain next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p> Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p> The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p> The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p> Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p> JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p> Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p> But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p> We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p> This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p> But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p> Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p> Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p> In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p> Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p> Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p> This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p> LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p> And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p> GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p> But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p> And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p> If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p> GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p> And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p> GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p> GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p> And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p> CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p> Am I missing something?  </p><p> GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p> I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p> They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p> So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p> Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p> Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p> Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p> The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p> So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p> I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p> The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p> Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p> Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p> EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p> I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p> But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p> But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p> So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p> Gianno?  </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p> However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p> You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p> So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p> But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p> And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p> And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p> But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p> There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p> And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p> But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p> Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p> And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p> BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p> That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p> I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p> All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p> By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p> We're on it after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p> They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p> Hey, Susan.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p> As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p> Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p> Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p> But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p> Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p> The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p> We will have more right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p> In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p> When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p> PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p> Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p> But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p> And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p> PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p> And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p> He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p> You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p> Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p> But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p> To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p> Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p> President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p> PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p> But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p> But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p> PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p> All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p> It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p> Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p> See you in about three hours.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.

Talk about a lot at stake.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"</p><p>We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats that Democrats are trying to flip. There are quite a few. Hillary Vaughn in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could leave some Democrats flipping out. And FOX Business Network's Connell McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop for Republicans.</p><p>We begin with Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break. And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into. They have been counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in November.</p><p>But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the ballot entirely because too many of them are running. So, the DCCC has had to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p>But still, they're worried that it won't be enough. They're targeting 10 seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.</p><p>But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.</p><p>Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA: I'm up against two millionaires, and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the Democratic Party does. So the public is going to wake up to that. And it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control their lives.</p><p>I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p>Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also fighting for his seat. He says it's good for Republicans, because if they are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the ballot entirely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican. So, what I want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on primary night today?</p><p>SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, are you kidding me?</p><p>If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election, it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation altogether. They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't have a candidate in the general elections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through California right here.</p><p>But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much.</p><p>To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily flip. That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to regain control of the House of Representatives.</p><p>That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states. But that's not all that is up for grabs.</p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so California is so important.</p><p>And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties. So here's the short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.</p><p>So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff Denham, that is his photo there. Now, in the 2016 presidential election, Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that district.</p><p>So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District. The incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight. And if you go back to the presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats, and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.</p><p>In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there. And if you go back to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.</p><p>Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these races. That may motivate voters to show up. California is home to more immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S. It's a huge issue there.</p><p>Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that have sanctuary city status. So, people are very clear either on one side or the other particularly about illegal immigration.</p><p>The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of trade wars. So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some of which is exported. California as a whole produces and sells more than $15 billion worth of agricultural products.</p><p>Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5 billion of goods are sold there. So, one of our 50 states, of course California. But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it would be the world's sixth largest economy.</p><p>Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey. And, of course, one of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners and real estate investors in New Jersey.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>BOLTON: There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that. And some calls I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line, that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of what people feel in their own pockets.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much.</p><p>In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's primaries?</p><p>Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p>Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised. Big backers of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes.</p><p>Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember, Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa. And he was talking about some of the concerns.</p><p>But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground -- and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to play out that way.</p><p>Again, it's just anecdotal. But in speaking to people, the president, among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts, with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from the people who supported him in the past. And they're cutting him some slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will play out over a matter of time.</p><p>I have been a little bit surprised by it.</p><p>CAVUTO: And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a -- maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here. So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns out to be a concession on the Chinese part. There's been no follow-up. We will see.</p><p>You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly the House.</p><p>And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good jobs report, and now they're not so sure. What is the latest read?</p><p>ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY: Exactly.</p><p>The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped Republicans. They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not been -- like we have analyzed advertisements. That's not been the number one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.</p><p>But it's certainly helping them. There is concern from Republicans here at the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the future based on national security.</p><p>We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being discussed. And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece of legislation.</p><p>So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.</p><p>CAVUTO: We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or at least that's the plan.</p><p>What is the political fallout of that?</p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Well, politically, some of these Republicans will not be at home in their districts.</p><p>That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands. But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.</p><p>So, right now, kind of hard to say. I will say that it's impossible to know what will be top of mind for voters come November. The Trump presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.</p><p>But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.</p><p>However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for voters, that could hurt the GOP.</p><p>And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p>And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p>Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote. The ones who are more satisfied generally will stay at home.</p><p>But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.</p><p>It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.</p><p>We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market reaction to these developments. If you're think we're focused on this, you should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: CAVUTO: Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his message?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Yes. I think it does.</p><p>And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether it's energy or what have you.</p><p>I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own disadvantage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that was the only thing reporters were interested in. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting Eagles?</p><p>QUESTION: This isn't about the national anthem. It's about so few players coming in the end.</p><p>QUESTION: Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?</p><p>QUESTION: Is this about something more than the national anthem, something other than the national anthem?</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Look, if this wasn't a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.</p><p>And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be overseas.</p><p>And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend the event.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: That was virtually all of the line of questioning.</p><p>And you know who spoke right before Sarah did? Of course, a topic economic adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p>But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again, get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p>Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail White House correspondent.</p><p>Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?</p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL: Well, and, yesterday, we saw something similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional or not for that to have been put in place.</p><p>And so we have seen this several times. But, to that point today, it's not necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked were things that the White House would have liked better.</p><p>We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in office and taxpayer dollars.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the president probably wouldn't like it?</p><p>Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North Koreans. He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the markets, et cetera, and then this.</p><p>CHAMBERS: And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.</p><p>That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe.</p><p>And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.</p><p>And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more, because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that Russia probe. And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.</p><p>CAVUTO: Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.</p><p>And I know I want to listen to what nerds say. I don't need it shoved back in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it. But, again, that's what economic advisers get. Right? So, he's going to make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you. But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer up reporters with some charts...</p><p>CAVUTO: Indeed.</p><p>CHAMBERS: ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting. Got a little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.</p><p>But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it does distract from the message.</p><p>And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more, and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous. And that was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.</p><p>Am I right?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today. She said that there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p>We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who were originally supposed to come.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CHAMBERS: And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that this ultimately fell apart.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow. All right.</p><p>Thank you very much, Francesca. Good seeing you again.</p><p>CHAMBERS: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right through it to save your job? What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate that has even some in his own party saying, really? Really?</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John Barrasso.</p><p>Senator, is this OK with you?</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING: Absolutely, Neil. I think it's an important thing to do.</p><p>We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place. So we want to be able to get more people confirmed.</p><p>But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear. He's not going to sign another continuing resolution. We need to do individual appropriations bills. We have work to be done on behalf of the American people.</p><p>And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me. I'm a surgeon. I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours. I think it's where we ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.</p><p>CAVUTO: How does that work, Senator?</p><p>Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States Senate. Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in session as well?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, no. Every senator makes their own decisions about when they're here or not.</p><p>CAVUTO: Including your own colleagues?</p><p>BARRASSO: Yes, but votes are called. And you can either be there to cast your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the country.</p><p>And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them. I'm going to be here doing the work. I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader, is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes. And that's how we plan to spend August.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them of time to be out on the campaign. Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House Republicans, but what are they saying?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, there are consequences to people's actions.</p><p>And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done. We want to get that work done. And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.</p><p>CAVUTO: Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p>I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not be too, too keen on it. Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during Memorial Day.</p><p>There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women all around Wyoming because of the tax bill. What we have seen is, they're keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p>Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay. Unemployment rates are down, which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that. I would like to make all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the end of this legislative session.</p><p>CAVUTO: When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats, but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p>BARRASSO: So, it's...</p><p>CAVUTO: In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is coming back to bite Republicans.</p><p>Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas. Are you worried about that?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his majority in the House and the Senate.</p><p>The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on. As you know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues. But I think we have great opportunities.</p><p>And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the Senate. And that's what I'm working on through the fall.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much. Very good seeing you again.</p><p>BARRASSO: Hey, thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in this country?</p><p>A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would never encounter this type of controversy again. He has again.</p><p>We will explain next.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.</p><p>Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see coming. They see it now and they're worried about it now.</p><p>The latest from the Big Island -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.</p><p>The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.</p><p>Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil, this is something we were sort of expecting.</p><p>Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.</p><p>But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor. Now, the fortunately thing is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already evacuated.</p><p>We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption from the Kilauea volcano. But just to give you the idea of just how much coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square miles.</p><p>This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the volcano. We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude earthquake. So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.</p><p>But the lava, that is the main thing. It's not stopping. It keeps spreading out. It might flow. The lava fountains might not reach as high as they were. But the lava just keeps spreading. And it's pouring into the ocean right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: Scary stuff.</p><p>Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p>Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word beyond that of human casualties here. But we will keep you posted.</p><p>In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction over Facebook. This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on users, among those device makers, Apple.</p><p>Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p>Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p>This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.</p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY: It can't go away.</p><p>And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, what is this? They would have this data, they would give it to device makers, like Apple. Was there anything sinister going on, on these device makers; part?</p><p>GARBER: Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung. The list keeps going, which is what is very scary.</p><p>But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even private messages with the device makers themselves.</p><p>And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these hardware services as service providers. So, in that way, they're bypassing any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore. You have to be explicit with users in gaining their consent.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.</p><p>If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.</p><p>GARBER: These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.</p><p>And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not responded to comment yet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Why would they want it?</p><p>GARBER: Why would they want it? They can monetize it. They can study the people that are buying their technology.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff. So, did he lie?</p><p>GARBER: Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.</p><p>And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p>CAVUTO: But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.</p><p>Am I missing something?</p><p>GARBER: You're not missing something.</p><p>I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing. And that's part of the problem.</p><p>They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go along. And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have the keys to our data kingdom. But they're making copies and sharing them with everybody else.</p><p>So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data? It looks like it's impossible.</p><p>CAVUTO: You think they don't know this is going on?</p><p>GARBER: Facebook is saying they didn't know. And...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, that's even scarier.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GARBER: It is scary.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p>GARBER: They should understand exactly what's going on. But recent reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I don't get it. But it doesn't all jibe with the public comments out of all of these guys.</p><p>Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.</p><p>Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton book. He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel about the president missing. The president is missing.</p><p>Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The truth is, the hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were asked.</p><p>The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble for me 20 years ago.</p><p>So, the first point is, I did. I meant it then, and I meant it now.</p><p>I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on that tour.</p><p>The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry exchange on NBC. But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats are wondering, do we need this right about now?</p><p>Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p>Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later. Is that a good thing for Democrats?</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Well, of course it's not a good thing for Democrats. And I think Democrats especially in red states know that.</p><p>I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.</p><p>But think about this. If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.</p><p>But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got Juanita Broaddrick. He's got other allegations of assault and harassment that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign trail for other people.</p><p>So, no, it's not good for Democrats. And red state Democrats should be running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton, this year.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa. We live in an age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.</p><p>Gianno?</p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: No, I don't think it's the same.</p><p>However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's greatest assets?</p><p>You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people felt. And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.</p><p>So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally and both locally today. And they said they want to keep their distance from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the upcoming midterms.</p><p>CAVUTO: Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p>But all that is falling on deaf ears.</p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: It is.</p><p>And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being brought back up. And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good. It's doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac. That was the singular moment, the defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that campaign.</p><p>And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech, but free speech has consequences. Just ask Roseanne Barr. We're each responsible for what we say and do. And he's not doing the party any favors rights now.</p><p>CAVUTO: When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.</p><p>But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured lot? That's a bit of a generalization. But people just shrug their shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes. And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p>There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo. And I think that's one of the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty. People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated women horribly.</p><p>And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain people hurt a party, help a party.</p><p>But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable candidates.</p><p>Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons in general, but especially in this MeToo movement. In this MeToo moment, Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a way that other Democrats can't.</p><p>CAVUTO: Gianno?</p><p>CALDWELL: And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's about his response, his reaction to it.</p><p>And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any candidate that he involves himself with. So you certainly don't want to be a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Amen to that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate? Does that make a difference in the scheme of things?</p><p>BIRO: Is that for me?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>BIRO: You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to point out the obvious. I have a responsibility to.</p><p>That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same cloth. They're both pointing themselves as victims here. So, I'm starting to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton here. And no one is buying it.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.</p><p>I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm kidding.</p><p>All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that book tour goes on.</p><p>By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade died. She killed herself. Now the issue is not only why, but what was going on in the financial background?</p><p>We're on it after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her apartment morning, apparent suicide here. That's according to law enforcement officials.</p><p>They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.</p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.</p><p>Hey, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>Tragic news in the fashion world today. The clothing and accessories designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this morning. New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.</p><p>As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The visionary founder of our brand has passed. Our thoughts are with her family at this incredibly heartbreaking time. We honor all the beauty she brought into this world.\"</p><p>Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags. She actually won the Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA.</p><p>Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes and being sold all around the world. Kate Spade doesn't own her own label, though. She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.</p><p>But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.</p><p>Kate was just 55 years old. She's survived by her husband and her daughter.</p><p>Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that: \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p>The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>We will have more right after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's summit with the North Korean dictator.</p><p>In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.</p><p>When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: What the heck? What does that mean?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, it either means Peter Navarro is out or Wilbur Ross. No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Exactly. Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p>PAYNE: Now we know we have got a deal.</p><p>Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>PAYNE: I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p>But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time. He's going to get a lot of publicity. So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or something like that, we will see what is going on.</p><p>CAVUTO: And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.</p><p>And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he can get for this big meeting. But a week from today, the pressure is on, the timetable is on. It's one day. And that's it.</p><p>PAYNE: Kim Jong-un went to school in the West. He obviously admired Western culture, including basketball.</p><p>And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people. And I think the administration must believe that too, because President Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.</p><p>He's made his overture very many times. So, maybe someone in the White House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong negotiating point.</p><p>CAVUTO: What you said is very deep and profound. What you are missing is that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of dangling, right?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, guess what? You could get a McD's. You could get a KFC. You can get it all.</p><p>You know what? Get you a Starbucks. We could throw it all in there. This is like Ron Popeil. But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.</p><p>Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar daddy here.</p><p>But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start denuclearizing.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an answer. But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their only currency they have. They make a few bucks making those big bronze statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that they have.</p><p>To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major economic injections. And so it's going to be a big number, I think. But I think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of this most dangerous part of planet.</p><p>CAVUTO: Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p>Not much reaction. Maybe some people didn't take it seriously. But that would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.</p><p>PAYNE: I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it, spiked the ball, and declared victory.</p><p>President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here. It's a strong, strong, tough, tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p>PAYNE: I think they -- I think it's a good overture. And I think it's -- listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p>But $70 billion is huge. Maybe they will work on the technology side. I think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability to open up their markets.</p><p>But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Charles, thank you very much.</p><p>PAYNE: You got it. Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO: You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately. I thought I would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.</p><p>PAYNE: I'm thinking about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: About an hour from now.</p><p>PAYNE: I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p>CAVUTO: You go. Go, baby, go.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With Charles Payne.\"</p><p>All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries, including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral process.</p><p>It starts at 8:00 p.m. We will go to whenever and however long it takes to give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.</p><p>Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have a very good chance of taking with the right candidate. We will find out tonight.</p><p>See you in about three hours.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018060502cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGV-4781-JB20-G0FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 5, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Kate Spade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Barrasso</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Suicide</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>House of Representatives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p> We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p> We begin with Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p> But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p> But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p> But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p> Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p> I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p> Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p> SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p> If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p> But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p> To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p> That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p> And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p> So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p> So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p> In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p> Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p> Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p> The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p> Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p> Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p> In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p> Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p> Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p> Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p> But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p> Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p> I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p> You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p> And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p> ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p> The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p> But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p> We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p> So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p> What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p> That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p> So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p> But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p> However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p> And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p> And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p> Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p> But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p> It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p> We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p> And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p> I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p> QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p> QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p> And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p> And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p> And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p> But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p> Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p> Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p> FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p> And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p> We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p> Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p> That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p> And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p> And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p> And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p> CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p> But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p> And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p> Am I right?</p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p> We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p> Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p> Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p> SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p> We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p> But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p> And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p> Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p> And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p> And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p> I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p> There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p> Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p> BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p> CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p> Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p> The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p> And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p> A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p> We will explain next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p> Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p> The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p> The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p> Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p> JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p> Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p> But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p> We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p> This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p> But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p> Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p> Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p> In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p> Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p> Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p> This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p> LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p> And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p> GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p> But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p> And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p> If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p> GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p> And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p> GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p> GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p> And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p> CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p> Am I missing something?  </p><p> GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p> I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p> They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p> So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p> Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p> Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p> Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p> The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p> So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p> I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p> The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p> Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p> Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p> EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p> I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p> But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p> But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p> So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p> Gianno?  </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p> However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p> You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p> So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p> But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p> And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p> And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p> But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p> There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p> And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p> But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p> Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p> And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p> BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p> That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p> I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p> All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p> By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p> We're on it after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p> They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p> Hey, Susan.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p> As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p> Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p> Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p> But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p> Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p> The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p> We will have more right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p> In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p> When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p> PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p> Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p> But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p> And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p> PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p> And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p> He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p> You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p> Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p> But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p> To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p> Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p> President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p> PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p> But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p> But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p> PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p> All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p> It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p> Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p> See you in about three hours.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p>We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p>We begin with Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p>But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p>But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p>But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p>Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p>I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p>Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p>SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p>If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p>But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p>To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p>That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p>And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p>So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p>So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p>In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p>Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p>Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p>The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p>Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p>Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p>In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p>Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p>Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p>Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p>But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p>Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p>I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p>You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p>And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p>ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p>The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p>But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p>We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p>So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p>What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p>That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p>So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p>But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p>However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p>And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p>And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p>Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p>But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p>It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p>We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p>We will have more after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p>And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p>I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p>QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p>And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p>And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p>And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p>But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p>Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p>Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p>And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p>We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p>Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p>That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p>And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p>And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p>And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p>CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p>But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p>And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p>Am I right?</p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p>We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p>Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p>We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p>But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p>And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p>Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p>And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p>And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p>I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p>There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p>Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p>BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p>Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p>The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p>And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p>A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p>We will explain next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p>Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p>The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p>The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p>Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p>Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p>But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p>We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p>This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p>But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p>Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p>Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p>In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p>Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p>Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p>This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p>And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p>GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p>But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p>And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p>If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p>GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p>And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p>GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p>GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p>And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p>Am I missing something?  </p><p>GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p>I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p>They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p>So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p>Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p>Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p>Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p>The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p>So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p>I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p>The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p>Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p>Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p>I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p>But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p>But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p>So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p>Gianno?  </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p>However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p>You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p>So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p>But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p>And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p>And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p>But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p>There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p>And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p>But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p>Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p>And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p>BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p>That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p>I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p>All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p>By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p>We're on it after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p>They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p>Hey, Susan.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p>As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p>Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p>Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p>But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p>Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p>The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>We will have more right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p>In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p>When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p>PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p>Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p>But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p>PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p>And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p>He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p>You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p>Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p>But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p>To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p>Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p>President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p>But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p>But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p>PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p>All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p>It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p>Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p>See you in about three hours.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.  Copyright CQ-2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p>We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p>We begin with Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p>But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p>But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p>But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p>Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p>I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p>Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p>SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p>If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p>But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p>To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p>That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p>And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p>So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p>So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p>In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p>Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p>Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p>The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p>Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p>Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p>In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p>Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p>Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p>Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p>But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p>Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p>I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p>You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p>And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p>ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p>The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p>But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p>We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p>So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p>What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p>That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p>So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p>But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p>However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p>And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p>And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p>Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p>But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p>It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p>We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p>We will have more after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p>And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p>I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p>QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p>And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p>And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p>And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p>But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p>Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p>Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p>And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p>We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p>Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p>That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p>And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p>And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p>And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p>CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p>But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p>And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p>Am I right?</p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p>We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p>Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p>We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p>But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p>And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p>Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p>And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p>And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p>I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p>There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p>Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p>BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p>Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p>The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p>And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p>A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p>We will explain next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p>Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p>The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p>The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p>Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p>Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p>But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p>We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p>This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p>But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p>Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p>Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p>In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p>Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p>Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p>This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p>And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p>GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p>But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p>And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p>If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p>GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p>And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p>GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p>GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p>And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p>Am I missing something?  </p><p>GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p>I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p>They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p>So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p>Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p>Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p>Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p>The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p>So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p>I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p>The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p>Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p>Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p>I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p>But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p>But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p>So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p>Gianno?  </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p>However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p>You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p>So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p>But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p>And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p>And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p>But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p>There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p>And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p>But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p>Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p>And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p>BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p>That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p>I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p>All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p>By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p>We're on it after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p>They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p>Hey, Susan.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p>As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p>Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p>Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p>But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p>Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p>The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>We will have more right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p>In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p>When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p>PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p>Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p>But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p>PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p>And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p>He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p>You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p>Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p>But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p>To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p>Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p>President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p>But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p>But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p>PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p>All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p>It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p>Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p>See you in about three hours.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.  Copyright CQ-2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p>We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p>We begin with Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p>But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p>But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p>But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p>Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p>I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p>Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p>SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p>If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p>But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p>To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p>That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p>And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p>So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p>So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p>In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p>Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p>Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p>The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p>Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p>Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p>In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p>Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p>Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p>Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p>But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p>Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p>I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p>You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p>And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p>ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p>The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p>But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p>We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p>So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p>What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p>SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p>That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p>So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p>But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p>However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p>And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p>And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p>Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p>But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p>It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p>We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p>We will have more after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p>And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p>I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p>QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p>And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p>And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p>And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p>But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p>Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p>Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p>And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p>We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p>Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p>That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p>And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p>And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p>And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p>CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p>CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p>But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p>And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p>Am I right?</p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p>We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p>CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p>Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p>We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p>But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p>And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p>Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p>And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p>And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p>I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p>There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p>Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p>BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p>CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p>Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p>The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p>And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p>BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p>A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p>We will explain next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p>Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p>The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p>The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p>Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p>Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p>But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p>We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p>This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p>But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p>Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p>Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p>In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p>Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p>Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p>This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p>LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p>And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p>GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p>But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p>And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p>If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p>GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p>And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p>GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p>GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p>And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p>CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p>Am I missing something?  </p><p>GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p>I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p>They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p>So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p>GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p>CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p>Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p>Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p>Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p>The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p>So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p>I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p>The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p>The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p>Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p>Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p>I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p>But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p>But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p>So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p>Gianno?  </p><p>GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p>However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p>You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p>So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p>But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p>ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p>And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p>And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p>But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p>There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p>And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p>But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p>Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p>CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p>And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p>JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p>BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p>BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p>That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p>I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p>All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p>By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p>We're on it after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p>They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p>Hey, Susan.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p>Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p>As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p>Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p>Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p>But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p>Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p>The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>We will have more right after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p>In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p>When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p>PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p>Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p>PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p>But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p>And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p>PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p>And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p>He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p>You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p>Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p>But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p>To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p>Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p>President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p>PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p>But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p>But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p>PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p>All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p>It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p>Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p>See you in about three hours.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.  Copyright CQ-2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Talk about a lot at stake.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Welcome.  I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  </p><p> We're all over it with FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton on the seats  that Democrats are trying to flip.  There are quite a few.  Hillary Vaughn  in Orange County, California, on how some win-or-take-all primaries could  leave some Democrats flipping out.  And FOX Business Network's Connell  McShane in Iowa on if the president's trade policies could be a big flop  for Republicans.  </p><p> We begin with Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Well, National Democrats tell me this California primary is make or break.   And voting is under way right now in Huntington Beach, California, one of  the districts Democrats poured millions of dollars into.  They have been  counting on a blue wave hitting California to add to their tally of seats  they want to flip across the country to secure the House majority in  November.</p><p> But national Democrats tell me they're worried they could be left off the  ballot entirely because too many of them are running.  So, the DCCC has had  to dump millions in the races, ask candidates to get out of the race.</p><p> But still, they're worried that it won't be enough.  They're targeting 10  seats in the race, four right here in Orange County, two open seats from  Republican representatives retiring, Darrell Issa and Ed Royce.  </p><p> But they're also targeting two seats that Republican incumbents are trying  to hold on to, Congressman Rohrabacher and Mimi Walters.  </p><p> Here's why, because these four districts voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.   So, Democrats saw an opening they want to use for their advantage in 2018.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. DANA ROHRABACHER (R), CALIFORNIA:  I'm up against two millionaires,  and we know that there's billionaires who are financing most of what the  Democratic Party does.  So the public is going to wake up to that.  And  it's not in their -- the interests of hardworking people to support some  political clique that is trying to basically control the state and control  their lives.  </p><p> I'm very confident and the Republican Party is about ready to surge back in  California, as compared to this blue wave that we're being told is coming.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  Here in Huntington Beach, Rohrabacher is not only fending off  Democrats, but also a fellow Republican in this primary.</p><p> Republican Scott Baugh is close friends with Rohrabacher, but he's also  fighting for his seat.  He says it's good for Republicans, because if they  are the two that face off in November, that would leave Democrats off the  ballot entirely.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  You're challenging Rohrabacher, a fellow Republican.  So, what I  want to know is, how do you think that actually helps Republicans on  primary night today?  </p><p> SCOTT BAUGH (R), CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE:  Well, are you kidding  me?</p><p> If the Republicans have two in the playoffs, two in the general election,  it means that this seat is removed from the Democrat calculation  altogether.  They can't win the seat, it's impossible, because they don't  have a candidate in the general elections.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  A Democratic lockout could be a huge nightmare for Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi, who has said the pathway to victory for them runs through  California right here.</p><p> But I talked to Democratic candidates that they have hand-picked and  they're still not ready to vocalize their support for a potential Speaker  Pelosi run if the Democrats were successful to win the majority in November  -- Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much. </p><p> To put California and some of these other states in perspective, California  and New Jersey alone have 12 Republican seats now held that could easily  flip.  That is about half the number that Democrats would need alone to  regain control of the House of Representatives.  </p><p> That's how much is at stake in just two prominent states.  But that's not  all that is up for grabs.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Deirdre Bolton keeping track of some of the tossup  races and issues that could have a huge impact.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, there's a lot, so  California is so important.  </p><p> And, I mean, experts are really saying these primaries are going to  potentially be make-or-break contests for both parties.  So here's the  short list, the ones that we're really focused on in the Golden State.  </p><p> So, the 10th Congressional District, the incumbent there, Republican Jeff  Denham, that is his photo there.  Now, in the 2016 presidential election,  Secretary Clinton beat President Trump by three percentage points in that  district.  </p><p> So, another that we're following, the 25th Congressional District.  The  incumbent there, Republican Steve Knight.  And if you go back to the  presidential election, you had a 7 percentage point gain by the Democrats,  and that was of course Hillary Clinton vs. President Trump.  </p><p> In California's 48th Congressional District, the incumbent there,  Republican Dana Rohrabacher, there is his photo there.  And if you go back  to the presidential election, it's only a 2 percentage point lead that  Hillary Clinton had over President Trump.  </p><p> Immigration, that is one of the most volatile issues for all of these  races.  That may motivate voters to show up.  California is home to more  immigrants, legal, undocumented, than any other state in the U.S.  It's a  huge issue there.  </p><p> Also, of those three key races that we highlighted, they are all ones that  have sanctuary city status.  So, people are very clear either on one side  or the other particularly about illegal immigration.  </p><p> The other big issue that may motivate California voters is the threat of  trade wars.  So, California grows tons of almonds, beans, milk, pork, some  of which is exported.  California as a whole produces and sells more than  $15 billion worth of agricultural products.  </p><p> Now, in that 10th Congressional District, all by itself, more than $2.5  billion of goods are sold there.  So, one of our 50 states, of course  California.  But, as a stand-alone country, like this trivia point, it  would be the world's sixth largest economy.  </p><p> Neil, you mentioned those three seats in New Jersey.  And, of course, one  of the things that the Republicans are going to be fighting against are the  Trump administration's tax plans, which hurt a lot of real estate owners  and real estate investors in New Jersey.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> BOLTON:  There's a lot of people pretty bitter about that.  And some calls  I made, they said, listen, if you're independent, if you're on the line,  that actually may help Democrats, if for no other reason than revenge of  what people feel in their own pockets.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes, their deductions were dramatically limited.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Deirdre, thank you very, very much. </p><p> In the meantime, will the economy trump fears of a trade war in today's  primaries?  </p><p> Let's get the read from Connell McShane, who has been talking to farmers  out in Iowa, USA Today's congressional reporter Eliza Collins, and The Wall  Street Journal's Shelby Holliday.</p><p> Connell, out there in farmland, of course, they're surprised.  Big backers  of Donald Trump in general, but concerned about a trade war that could have  the Chinese not buying a lot of the stuff they produce, right?  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  </p><p> Neil, what is interesting on this very program yesterday, as you remember,  Neil, we had a farmer named Ron Heck on the show from here in Iowa.  And he  was talking about some of the concerns.  </p><p> But what I will say after spending a couple days out here on the ground --  and this is just anecdotal, speaking to Heck and some others this morning  out at a Dubuque diner about this very subject -- is just because you  assume that one thing is true, in other words, a trade war policy or a  protectionist policy from the White House is going to hurt somebody, the  president, Republicans, politically, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to  play out that way.  </p><p> Again, it's just anecdotal.  But in speaking to people, the president,  among his supporters, Neil, he has built up a lot of equity with tax cuts,  with deregulatory policies, where that support seems to still be solid from  the people who supported him in the past.  And they're cutting him some  slack and willing to see how this trade debate and trade discussion will  play out over a matter of time.  </p><p> I have been a little bit surprised by it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And as you reported earlier as well, the Chinese offered a --  maybe a first opening salvo here to buy $70 billion of U.S. agricultural- related products here.  So, that could ease a lot of this angst if it turns  out to be a concession on the Chinese part.  There's been no follow-up.  We  will see.  </p><p> You know, Eliza, when you look at what's going on here, the view had been  not too long ago that we face a blue wave here, that Democrats were  certainly going to gain a lot of seats, enough to tip the balance of power  in the either House and/or Senate, less likely the Senate, still possibly  the House.</p><p> And then along came an improving economy, along came a startlingly good  jobs report, and now they're not so sure.  What is the latest read?  </p><p> ELIZA COLLINS, USA TODAY:  Exactly.  </p><p> The economy's improvement and the steady, strong economy has really helped  Republicans.  They feel good about their tax cuts, although they have not  been -- like we have analyzed advertisements.  That's not been the number  one issue they have been talking about, which is a little bit interesting.  </p><p> But it's certainly helping them.  There is concern from Republicans here at  the Capitol about these impending trade wars, so much concern, that they're  actually talking about a bill right now that could basically give Congress  the authority to vote up or down the president's proposed tariffs in the  future based on national security.  </p><p> We don't know if that has enough votes right now, but it's certainly being  discussed.  And something interesting is, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  has not ruled it out of being added or at least voted on a separate piece  of legislation.  </p><p> So, he's not stopping it, which does say that Republicans here are  concerned about the effects of a possible trade war.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  We should also mention, and she did, you know, Shelby, this idea  that Republicans, Mitch McConnell are concerned enough about getting more  stuff done, that they're going to be working through the August recess, or  at least that's the plan.  </p><p> What is the political fallout of that?  </p><p> SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Well, politically, some of these  Republicans will not be at home in their districts.  </p><p> That means less time on the campaign trail meeting voters, shaking hands.   But, on the flip side, if they get a lot done and they accomplish things  Republicans want to see them accomplish, it could be a good thing.  </p><p> So, right now, kind of hard to say.  I will say that it's impossible to  know what will be top of mind for voters come November.  The Trump  presidency seems to change news cycles every hour, if not every day.  </p><p> But if economy is top of mind -- I was looking through some Wall Street  polls -- and most voters feel that the Republicans are in a better place to  handle the economy, things like taxes, trade, the deficit.  </p><p> However, if an issue like immigration or health care is top of mind for  voters, that could hurt the GOP.  </p><p> And I would add the trade -- the question about a trade war has thrown a  huge wrench into this, because if there's a trade war and if most voters  start to think that Democrats could handle the economy better, if they  start to think Democrats would be better on trade, then you see this huge  list of issues that most voters would feel Democrats are better on.</p><p> And that could really threaten Republicans come November in the midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, guys, I want to all very, very much.</p><p> Just a reminder here, the typical rule of thumb in these midterm election  is whoever is angrier will usually go out to vote.  The ones who are more  satisfied generally will stay at home.  </p><p> But if you're feeling better about things, that could mean there's fewer  angrier, so the angry side that presumably would want to go against the  incumbent party does not, and the people who are very happy with things  maybe do consider going out and voting for the incumbent party.  </p><p> It's a rule of thumb that's been all over the map and not consistent, but  we are going to see if it plays out tonight beginning at 8:00 p.m., when  FOX Business picks up our special live coverage of this to whenever in  eight crucial states will have a lot to say about the direction, not only  of this race, but this economy, and whether Democrats can make good on a  promise and a commitment to take back the House and maybe the Senate.  </p><p> We will explore that from all angles, as well as get real-time world market  reaction to these developments.  If you're think we're focused on this, you  should see the attention this gets in the foreign press.  </p><p> We will have more after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  CAVUTO:  Do you think when the president weighs in, as he has  right now, to disinviting the Philadelphia Eagles to come to the White  House, or some of these other ancillary issues, they get the focus off  legitimate issues, the way that people like Donald Trump or not, that kind  of distraction -- and he is known for doing this a lot -- hurts his  message?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> NEWT GINGRICH (R), FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Yes.  I think it does.  </p><p> And, again, part of why I wrote \"Trump's America\" is to pull together in  one volume the good things that are happening across the broad, whether  it's energy or what have you.</p><p> I think President Trump at times clutters his own message, to his own  disadvantage.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Proof-positive, this whole Philadelphia Eagles things today, that  was the only thing reporters were interested in.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> QUESTION:  Does he risk alienating key voters in that state by disinviting  Eagles?  </p><p> QUESTION:  This isn't about the national anthem.  It's about so few players  coming in the end.  </p><p> QUESTION:  Does he bear zero responsibility for the players like the  Warriors and the Cavs not wanting to come, and the Eagles bailing?  </p><p> QUESTION:  Is this about something more than the national anthem, something  other than the national anthem?  </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Look, if this wasn't  a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned  to attend the event, and then backed out at the last minute.  </p><p> And if it wasn't a political stunt, then they wouldn't have attempted to  reschedule the visit when they knew that the president was going to be  overseas.</p><p> And if this wasn't a political stunt, they wouldn't have waited until  Monday, well after 1,000 of their fans had traveled and taken time out of  their schedules, to offer only a tiny handful of representatives to attend  the event.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That was virtually all of the line of questioning.  </p><p> And you know who spoke right before Sarah did?  Of course, a topic economic  adviser delineating all the good economic news we have seen.</p><p> But, again, it falls on deaf ears when maybe the president himself grabs on  to some of these other events that might be perfectly valid, but, again,  get everyone's attention perfectly off the subject at hand, including an  improving economy, which the president says fake news types don't report.</p><p> Francesca Chambers, of course, at those daily sessions, The Daily Mail  White House correspondent.  </p><p> Francesca, he curses his own message, does he not?  </p><p> FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL:  Well, and, yesterday, we saw something  similar, where reporters repeatedly asked Sarah Sanders about the  president's tweets about whether the special counsel was unconstitutional  or not for that to have been put in place.  </p><p> And so we have seen this several times.  But, to that point today, it's not  necessarily true that if reporters hadn't been asking about the Eagles not  coming to the White House that the questions that would have been asked  were things that the White House would have liked better.  </p><p> We also heard things in the room today about Scott Pruitt, the EPA  administrator and fresh allegations that he may have abused his power in  office and taxpayer dollars.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Is it your sense, though, that this whole football thing with the  Eagles and whatever has created a furor and a distraction at a time the  president probably wouldn't like it?  </p><p> Whatever the merits of his argument and people standing for the national  anthem, whatever, but he's a week ahead of crucial talks with the North  Koreans.  He does have a compelling argument to make about the economy, the  markets, et cetera, and then this.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And you make a key point, Neil, about this summit with Kim Jong- un in Singapore.  </p><p> That's something else that we barely heard about today, aside from the fact  that he will meet Thursday at the White House with the Japanese prime  minister, Shinzo Abe.  </p><p> And didn't really have a chance today to ask about the president's tweets  this morning about North Korea in which he said that he hopes and expects  that something successful will come out of this today, Neil.  </p><p> And so, again, though, sometimes, the questions, however, wouldn't  necessarily be things that the White House wants to talk about more,  because we also saw the president again tweeting this week about that  Russia probe.  And that's something that Sarah Sanders also didn't want to  talk about today, deferring questions to the special counsel about that  statement that the president may have dictated about his son Don Jr.'s  meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Obviously, that has galvanized all the attention, not so much  economic officials when they speak, which, as an economic reporter, I kind  of bristle at, because I know people think I'm a nerd.  </p><p> And I know I want to listen to what nerds say.  I don't need it shoved back  in my face that, you're so boring, Neil, we don't want to hear about it.   But, again, that's what economic advisers get.  Right?  So, he's going to  make a compelling argument, look at what is turning out right beneath you.   But it's his boss himself that is distracting that attention.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Kevin Hassett did say that he was going to try and cheer  up reporters with some charts...</p><p> CAVUTO:  Indeed.</p><p> CHAMBERS:  ... to try and make it a little bit more interesting.  Got a  little bit of a visual representation there and a pamphlet held out, Neil.  </p><p> But, again, this is something that, as you heard Newt Gingrich say, and  even allies of the president, that when he does some of these tweets, it  does distract from the message.</p><p> And we heard President Trump say -- or saw him say on Twitter last week  that he was not going to focus on some of these things like Russia as much  and he was going to focus on North Korea and that summit a little bit more,  and then has continued to tweet about the Russia probe since then.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Real quickly on this football thing, I'm beginning to think that when he  got word that it was down to 10 or so Philadelphia Eagles going to this  event, he preempted that, said, all right, this is ridiculous.  And that  was the catalyst, that it was such a small number.  </p><p> Am I right?</p><p> CHAMBERS:  Well, Sarah Sanders also brought that up today.  She said that  there were going to be what she called a tiny number.</p><p> We believe to be 10 to 12 were going to show up out of the more than 80 who  were originally supposed to come.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  And they cited that as part of the reason, in addition to the  national anthem and the kneeling, as a reason that the White House called  off this event, but also what they described as the Eagles trying to move  the event to a time that was inconvenient for the president, when he was  scheduled to be overseas in Singapore for that summit, as a reason that  this ultimately fell apart.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Wow.  All right.  </p><p> Thank you very much, Francesca.  Good seeing you again.  </p><p> CHAMBERS:  Thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> In the meantime, who needs a summer vacation when you can work right  through it to save your job?  What Mitch McConnell is trying to orchestrate  that has even some in his own party saying, really?  Really?  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, we already talked about Mitch McConnell's plan to keep  everybody, at least the Republicans, in the Capitol in the month of August  during the typically otherwise four-week August recess, Wyoming Republican  Senator, member of the Foreign Relations Committee, among many others, John  Barrasso.</p><p> Senator, is this OK with you?  </p><p> SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), WYOMING:  Absolutely, Neil.  I think it's an  important thing to do.  </p><p> We have been dealing with historic obstruction, deliberate delays by the  Democrats just in terms of getting the president's team in place.  So we  want to be able to get more people confirmed.  </p><p> But, additionally, you know, the president has been very clear.  He's not  going to sign another continuing resolution.  We need to do individual  appropriations bills.  We have work to be done on behalf of the American  people.  </p><p> And in terms of the so-called recess, look, you know me.  I'm a surgeon.   I'm used to working nights, weekends, long hours.  I think it's where we  ought to be and the work we ought to be doing for the American people.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  How does that work, Senator?  </p><p> Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the United States  Senate.  Can he compel the minority party, the Democrats, to stay in  session as well?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, no.  Every senator makes their own decisions about when  they're here or not.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Including your own colleagues?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Yes, but votes are called.  And you can either be there to cast  your vote or not, to represent your state or not on matters critical to the  country.  </p><p> And if individuals want to not be here, well, that's up to them.  I'm going  to be here doing the work.  I know that Senator McConnell, as our leader,  is going to be continuing on the floor putting up measures for votes, for  discussions, for debates, and ultimately for votes.  And that's how we plan  to spend August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, some of your colleagues concerned that this robs them  of time to be out on the campaign.  Some of them are pretty vulnerable, not  across the Senate, where the prospects are very different than House  Republicans, but what are they saying?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, there are consequences to people's actions.  </p><p> And when you put that kind of delay deliberately on slowing down the  president's nominations, we still have lots of work to be done.  We want to  get that work done.  And if we haven't gotten it done so far, which we  haven't, we need to make sure we get our work done in August.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Where do you see things going right now among your colleagues and  the likelihood to visit another second shot at the tax cut, one that would  make permanent rate cuts for individuals?</p><p> I know Senator McConnell, when I last chatted with him, sir, seemed to not  be too, too keen on it.  Maybe he was thinking that it would help some of  the most vulnerable Democrats who would get another shot at this, maybe  vote for a phase two, when they didn't for phase one.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, you know, Neil, I was home in Wyoming all last week during  Memorial Day.  </p><p> There's a confidence and an optimism in families, in working men and women  all around Wyoming because of the tax bill.  What we have seen is, they're  keeping more of their hard-earned money, because taxes are lower.</p><p> Plus, they're seeing raises in their pay.  Unemployment rates are down,  which means people can wake up and know they have an opportunity for a job  and to go forward, and the hope that comes from that.  I would like to make  all of these tax cuts permanent and work to that end between now and the  end of this legislative session.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at what is happening in the Senate, where it's  likely you guys could actually pick up seats, depending on how you want to  look at the math, but a very different battle going on in the House, is it  your sense that Republicans hold on, not only in the Senate, where, like I  said, there's an argument to be made where you could pick up some seats,  but in the House, that in some of these very dramatic races, that the edge  to Democrats isn't what was the case?</p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, the president's policies, in terms of taxes, in cutting  taxes, cutting regulations, unleashing American energy, very unpopular  around the United States, because the economy is so strong, and what that  means to working families and having more money to spend.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, it's not popular everywhere, right?</p><p> BARRASSO:  So, it's...</p><p> CAVUTO:  In some of the high-tax states, like New Jersey, where there are  at least seven vulnerable Republican districts now, it's -- that tax cut is  coming back to bite Republicans.  </p><p> Now, it might be playing out in some other high-tax areas.  Are you worried  about that?  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Well, Neil, I want to make sure the president maintains his  majority in the House and the Senate.  </p><p> The Senate races are the ones that I have continued to focus on.  As you  know, I'm up for reelection this year, as are a number of my colleagues.   But I think we have great opportunities.  </p><p> And like you, I share the opinion that we have an opportunity to actually  pick up seats to make it easier to get the president's agenda through the  Senate.  And that's what I'm working on through the fall.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Senator Barrasso, thank you very much.  Very good  seeing you again.  </p><p> BARRASSO:  Hey, thanks, Neil.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> Do any of you remember when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before Congress  and tried to lay down the new law here that there's nothing beyond what I'm  telling you now that indicates problems or compromised data from anyone in  this country?  </p><p> A big old oops for the rich guy who founded a company, hoping that he would  never encounter this type of controversy again.  He has again.</p><p> We will explain next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We're getting some very scary reports coming out of Hawaii now.  </p><p> Hundreds of homes destroyed overnight with an eruption they didn't see  coming.  They see it now and they're worried about it now. </p><p> The latest from the Big Island -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, this came out of nowhere, reports of hundreds of homes  potentially destroyed by that volcano in Hawaii.  </p><p> The latest right now from our own Jeff Paul.  </p><p> Jeff, what are you hearing?</p><p> JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Neil, this is something we were  sort of expecting.  </p><p> Emergency responders told us don't be surprised if this number of houses  that are destroyed jumps a little bit, because obviously it is hard to tell  really what's going on back there, as the lava covers this area.  </p><p> But we're learning at least hundreds were destroyed overnight, and one of  those homes belonging to Hawaii County's mayor.  Now, the fortunately thing  is that most of the people, we're hearing, in that area were already  evacuated.  </p><p> We haven't heard of any injuries or any deaths yet regarding this eruption  from the Kilauea volcano.  But just to give you the idea of just how much  coverage area this volcano is now spreading out to and the lava, 7.7 square  miles.</p><p> This is on top of the things that are happening at the summit of the  volcano.  We had another earthquake this morning, a 5.6-magnitude  earthquake.  So, it seems like the activity is continuing on.  </p><p> But the lava, that is the main thing.  It's not stopping.  It keeps  spreading out.  It might flow.  The lava fountains might not reach as high  as they were.  But the lava just keeps spreading.  And it's pouring into  the ocean right now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Scary stuff.</p><p> Jeff Paul, thank you very much, and keeping us updated.</p><p> Again, this doesn't seem to be beyond just real estate destruction, homes  destroyed certainly, not a light matter for anyone, but, so far, no word  beyond that of human casualties here.  But we will keep you posted.</p><p> In the meantime, back in the continental United States and the friction  over Facebook.  This times, the heads of the Senate Commerce Committee  sending a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg over a report, this one in The New  York Times, that said the company might have given device makers data on  users, among those device makers, Apple.  </p><p> Lawmakers want answers by June 18.</p><p> Attorney Leeza Garber back with us on this stuff.</p><p> This is the problem that can ever go away for this company.  </p><p> LEEZA GARBER, ATTORNEY:  It can't go away. </p><p> And we're only recently learning the levels to which Facebook has been  playing fast and loose with Americans' data privacy for years.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, what is this?  They would have this data, they would give it  to device makers, like Apple.  Was there anything sinister going on, on  these device makers; part?  </p><p> GARBER:  Part of the problem with this New York Times report on data  sharing with device makers -- and you mentioned Apple -- it's also Amazon,  BlackBerry, Microsoft, Samsung.  The list keeps going, which is what is  very scary.  </p><p> But what happened is, not only was Facebook sharing data with applications  like the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we saw in recent months, but now  we have come to understand that they're sharing relationship status about  information from the Facebook profiles, photographs, potentially even  private messages with the device makers themselves.  </p><p> And the way that they have been able to do this is by categorizing these  hardware services as service providers.  So, in that way, they're bypassing  any sort of liability they had put in with the FTC, which had released a  decree in 2011, saying, you can't play fast and loose anymore.  You have to  be explicit with users in gaining their consent.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  But Tim Cook at Apple said he didn't do this kind of  stuff and that Apple didn't do this kind of stuff.  </p><p> If you're right about this, they did get this kind of stuff.  </p><p> GARBER:  These device makers definitely got access to this kind of data.  </p><p> And whether they're storing it on their own servers, some of them have not  responded to comment yet.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Why would they want it?  </p><p> GARBER:  Why would they want it?  They can monetize it.  They can study the  people that are buying their technology.</p><p> CAVUTO:  But, again, Tim Cook said he didn't do that kind of stuff.  So,  did he lie?  </p><p> GARBER:  Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't do this kind of stuff either.  </p><p> And you have to -- if you look back...</p><p> CAVUTO:  But it was Tim Cook who was pointing and wagging his finger at  Zuckerberg, saying that this is something that Apple would never do.  </p><p> Am I missing something?  </p><p> GARBER:  You're not missing something.  </p><p> I think the way that these key technological players are categorizing how  they're taking data, what they're doing with it keeps changing.  And that's  part of the problem.  </p><p> They're all in on this game, but they're creating the rules as they go  along.  And when you look at it, Facebook and these big tech companies have  the keys to our data kingdom.  But they're making copies and sharing them  with everybody else.  </p><p> So, how are we actually supposed to gain control of our data?  It looks  like it's impossible.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  You think they don't know this is going on?  </p><p> GARBER:  Facebook is saying they didn't know.  And... </p><p> CAVUTO:  So, that's even scarier.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GARBER:  It is scary.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> GARBER:  They should understand exactly what's going on.  But recent  reports are saying, look how at far back this kind of corruption goes.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, I don't get it.  But it doesn't all jibe with the public  comments out of all of these guys.  </p><p> Leeza Garber, the attorney, cyber-security expert.  </p><p> Speaking of cyber-security, it's basically the theme of this Bill Clinton  book.  He and Patterson came together to come up with a dramatic novel  about the president missing.  The president is missing.  </p><p> Bill Clinton on a tour for this book might wish that he were -- after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The truth is, the  hubbub was I got hot under the collar because of the way the questions were  asked.  </p><p> The suggestion was that I never apologized for what caused all the trouble  for me 20 years ago.  </p><p> So, the first point is, I did.  I meant it then, and I meant it now.  </p><p> I apologized to my family, to Monica Lewinsky and her family, and to the  American people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right.  </p><p> The president is sort of getting a lesson in going on a book tour and not  assuming all sorts of other questions beyond the book would come out on  that tour.   </p><p> The president trying to dial back some of the comments he made in an angry  exchange on NBC.  But the fact of the matter is, he did, and some Democrats  are wondering, do we need this right about now?  </p><p> Democratic strategist Robin Biro, FOX News political analyst Gianno  Caldwell, and The Washington Examiner's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p> Emily, whatever people think about what happened 20 years ago with Bill  Clinton, it's all coming back 20 years later.  Is that a good thing for  Democrats?  </p><p> EMILY JASHINSKY, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Well, of course it's not a good  thing for Democrats.  And I think Democrats especially in red states know  that.  </p><p> I think there's more willingness among blue state Democrats, people in  Maryland, people in New York, to use the Clintons on the campaign trail.  </p><p> But think about this.  If Bill Clinton is going to release a book and go on  a publicity tour and campaign in the year of MeToo, in the MeToo era, he's  going to face questions about Monica Lewinsky, of course.  </p><p> But now that the precedent has been set in that NBC interview, that's one  part of a broader story when it comes to Bill Clinton, because he has got  Juanita Broaddrick.  He's got other allegations of assault and harassment  that he's going to face that will dog him if he goes out on the campaign  trail for other people.  </p><p> So, no, it's not good for Democrats.  And red state Democrats should be  running in the opposite direction of the Clintons, especially Bill Clinton,  this year.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Well, red state Republicans and other -- feel the same effect with  Bill Clinton as they do with Donald Trump and vice versa.  We live in an  age where I don't know if this stuff resonates like it used to.  </p><p> Gianno?  </p><p> GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST:  No, I don't think it's the  same.</p><p> However, who would have thunk -- not thought -- who would have thunk that  the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, would become the Republican Party's  greatest assets?  </p><p> You got a guy who has been off his game since the 2016 election who  admitted that President Trump or then candidate Donald Trump was correct  about the anxiety people felt, the anxiety, the economic angst that people  felt.  And those were a continuation of the Obama policies, which he I  guess forgot that their playbook was four more years of the Obama policies.  </p><p> So, when it comes to what he's doing, I have talked to Democrats nationally  and both locally today.  And they said they want to keep their distance  from both Hillary and Bill, because it does nothing to benefit them for the  upcoming midterms.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Robin, when you are looking at this and the back and forth, and  resurrecting Bill Clinton, even though this is a very unusual type of a  book -- it's a work of fiction to talk about what would happen if the  president just upped and disappeared -- it's a topical issue about cyber- security, something this president has been warning about.</p><p> But all that is falling on deaf ears.  </p><p> ROBIN BIRO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  It is.  </p><p> And what people are hearing are 20-year-old accusations that are being  brought back up.  And as a red state Democrat, it's doing us no good.  It's  doing about as much good as it did Hillary Clinton when he had that meeting  with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac.  That was the singular moment, the  defining moment where I knew we had serious trouble on our hands for that  campaign.  </p><p> And I don't want to trample on his First Amendment rights to free speech,  but free speech has consequences.  Just ask Roseanne Barr.  We're each  responsible for what we say and do.  And he's not doing the party any  favors rights now.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  When you look at this, and you think of what has happened since  the emergence of the MeToo movement, Emily, and everything else, there's  enough blame and questionable behavior to go around, and some questionable  conduct to go around, where no one should be pointing fingers at anyone.  </p><p> But, be that as it may, does this neutralize a worry that Republicans had  about their own president, comments he has made, that it's all a soured  lot?  That's a bit of a generalization.  But people just shrug their  shoulders and say, all right, whoever is in charge, are they helping me  out, whatever they are morally that I might or might not like?  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Yes.  And I think that's absolutely accurate.</p><p> There's really been no partisan bent to MeToo.  And I think that's one of  the most depressing things about it, right, is everybody is equally guilty.   People in both parties have done despicable things and have mistreated  women horribly.</p><p> And, so, yes, I don't think specifically there's a partisan benefit to  either side when it comes to whether the MeToo allegations against certain  people hurt a party, help a party.  </p><p> But I do think, in specific races, where the Clintons are trying to target  their efforts, you could absolutely see Bill Clinton coming into the local  news market and just being an incredible distraction for vulnerable  candidates.</p><p> Even for good candidates, he's going to be a huge distraction, the Clintons  in general, but especially in this MeToo movement.  In this MeToo moment,  Bill Clinton is not helpful to anybody he's campaigning for, which is kind  of unfortunate for him, because he does connect with red state voters in a  way that other Democrats can't.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Gianno?  </p><p> CALDWELL:  And to that point, if I could real quickly, really quickly, it's  about his response, his reaction to it.  </p><p> And I think that's what is going to get voters thinking twice about any  candidate that he involves himself with.  So you certainly don't want to be  a candidate that has a fair shot to have Bill Clinton,who may have a hot  collar when reporters are asking him questions, and take all the attention  away from the work that you're going and put it squarely on himself.  </p><p> JASHINSKY:  Amen to that.</p><p> CAVUTO:  Do you think, Robin, that candidates or voters, you know, are  drawn to whoever is supporting another candidate?  Does that make a  difference in the scheme of things?  </p><p> BIRO:  Is that for me?  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Yes.  </p><p> BIRO:  You know, what I have got to say here is just that I have got to  point out the obvious.  I have a responsibility to.</p><p> That it seems like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are cut from the same  cloth.  They're both pointing themselves as victims here.  So, I'm starting  to wonder if Donald Trump just didn't take up a lesson from Bill Clinton  here.  And no one is buying it.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  I don't know understand that means, but it sounds very profound.  </p><p> I want to thank you all, seriously, guys.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  I'm kidding.  </p><p> All right, we just don't know, but the back and forth goes on, and that  book tour goes on.  </p><p> By now, you have heard the sad news that the fashion designer Kate Spade  died.  She killed herself.  Now the issue is not only why, but what was  going on in the financial background?  </p><p> We're on it after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, fashion designer Kate Spade dead, found dead in her  apartment morning, apparent suicide here.  That's according to law  enforcement officials.</p><p> They're still trying to unravel what happened and why.  </p><p>FOX Business Network's Susan Li with the latest.  </p><p> Hey, Susan.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Neil.  </p><p> Tragic news in the fashion world today.  The clothing and accessories  designer known as Kate Spade found dead in her Park Avenue apartment this  morning.  New York police say that her housekeeper found Ms. Spade in her  bedroom hanging from a red scarf tied to a doorknob.  </p><p> As you can imagine, there's been an outpouring of grief and tributes coming  in, including this tweet from her eponymous fashion label, Kate Spade: \"The  visionary founder of our brand has passed.  Our thoughts are with her  family at this incredibly heartbreaking time.  We honor all the beauty she  brought into this world.\"</p><p> Kate Spade really making her name in the late 1990s, making her mark with  her functional, simple, yet stylish city bags.  She actually won the  Accessory Designer of the Year Award in 1998 from the CFDA. </p><p> Now, her label has gone on to grow not just for bags, but clothing, shoes  and being sold all around the world.  Kate Spade doesn't own her own label,  though.  She sold her company back in 1999 to the Neiman Marcus group.  </p><p> But just to give you a sense how available her name and her brand has  become, Kate Spade name was sold to the owners of the Coach and Stuart  Weitzman brands back in 2017 for nearly $2.5 billion.  </p><p>Kate was just 55 years old.  She's survived by her husband and her  daughter.  </p><p> Ivanka Trump also tweeting in response to this loss today, saying that:  \"Kate Spade's tragic passing is a painful reminder that we never truly know  another's pain or burden that they carry.\"</p><p> The National Suicide Prevention Line that -- can be reached on the number  that you see on your screen there -- Neil, back to you.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Susan, thank you very, very much.</p><p> We will have more right after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> CAVUTO:  We are getting word -- I kid you not -- this from our colleagues  at The New York Post -- that NBA star turned Kim Jong-un soul mate, as they  call him, Dennis Rodman, will be in Singapore ahead of the president's  summit with the North Korean dictator.  </p><p> In fact, he might in fact be part of this ongoing process.  </p><p> When I think of who could figure out what the heck this means, I go to my  buddy, my good, good friend for so many years Charles Payne to put him on  the spot, and his career and as well.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  What the heck?  What does that mean?</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, it either means Peter Navarro  is out or Wilbur Ross.  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Exactly.  Dennis Rodman is now...</p><p> PAYNE:  Now we know we have got a deal.  </p><p> Sounds like some sort of publicity stunt.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Right. </p><p> PAYNE:  I think we better wait to get more information on that.</p><p> But it certainly sounds like someone having a good time.  He's going to get  a lot of publicity.  So, maybe if he is wearing a pair of Skechers or  something like that, we will see what is going on.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  And he does -- he's one of the few Americans who has a  relationship and who has an ongoing one with Kim Jong-un.  </p><p> And I'm just wondering, the president probably can use all the friends he  can get for this big meeting.  But a week from today, the pressure is on,  the timetable is on.  It's one day.  And that's it.</p><p> PAYNE:  Kim Jong-un went to school in the West.  He obviously admired  Western culture, including basketball.  </p><p> And a lot of people say that the Olympics, going and watching what's  happening, that maybe, just maybe he does want something for his people.   And I think the administration must believe that too, because President  Trump over and over again has made these overtures about hardworking North  Koreans, about the opportunities and about the investments that are going  to pour in from China, Japan, South Korea.  </p><p> He's made his overture very many times.  So, maybe someone in the White  House believes also that that's another strong economic -- a strong  negotiating point.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  What you said is very deep and profound.  What you are missing is  that maybe he just wants a fast food outlet.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  Right, because that was one of the things that we were sort of  dangling, right?   </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, guess what?  You could get a McD's.  You could get a KFC.   You can get it all.  </p><p> You know what?  Get you a Starbucks.  We could throw it all in there.  This  is like Ron Popeil.  But, wait, there's more, you know?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  The onus does seem to be on us, though, to provide a lot of money.  </p><p> Now, the president has already made clear, and lowered expectations, that  don't expect a lot of that, and don't expect us to sort of be the sugar  daddy here.  </p><p> But I am wondering what we would offer in return for this kingdom to start  denuclearizing.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> I have asked that question of all the experts, and none have given me an  answer.  But there is no doubt the nukes are North Korea's -- they're their  only currency they have.  They make a few bucks making those big bronze  statues for other dictators, but besides that, it's the only currency that  they have.</p><p> To give that up, you need a combination of guaranteed safety and major  economic injections.  And so it's going to be a big number, I think.  But I  think the world will say the number can't be too big, if you get rid of  this most dangerous part of planet.  </p><p> CAVUTO:  Separately, we got signs that we have lost -- that the Chinese are  offering to buy up $70 billion worth of agricultural goods from us.</p><p> Not much reaction.  Maybe some people didn't take it seriously.  But that  would be quite a coup for the president, were it to pass.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I think a lot of other presidents would've taken that, ran with it,  spiked the ball, and declared victory.  </p><p> President Trump is playing a very, very tough game here.  It's a strong,  strong, tough, tough game.</p><p> CAVUTO:  So, he didn't respond one way or the other, right?</p><p> PAYNE:  I think they -- I think it's a good overture.  And I think it's --  listen, he threw out some larger numbers than that.</p><p> But $70 billion is huge.  Maybe they will work on the technology side.  I  think, ultimately, we are going to hear some sort of number of $100 billion  talked about, and probably a combination of lower tariffs and the ability  to open up their markets.  </p><p> But also you have got to get something on the technology side, particularly  since President Trump revived ZTE.</p><p> CAVUTO:  All right, Charles, thank you very much.  </p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.  Thanks.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You were ready for that Rodman thing, unfortunately.  I thought I  would kind of zing you with that one.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That's a free lead for your fine show tonight.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I'm thinking about it.</p><p> CAVUTO:  About an hour from now.</p><p> PAYNE:  I'm calling the crew right now.</p><p> CAVUTO:  You go.  Go, baby, go.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAVUTO:  That is the lead, 6:00 p.m. for his fine show, \"Making Money With  Charles Payne.\"  </p><p> All right, and we will be making a lot of coverage for you tonight on all  these key states, eight of them right now that have very crucial primaries,  including California, where they have redone the math on the electoral  process.  </p><p> It starts at 8:00 p.m.  We will go to whenever and however long it takes to  give you the -- sort of the place setting for the midterm elections.  </p><p> Now, 12 of those races are in safe districts that Democrats think they have  a very good chance of taking with the right candidate.  We will find out  tonight.  </p><p> See you in about three hours.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, Inc.

Instead the US economy added 2.5 million jobs. The report certainly supports the view that the economy may experience a faster recovery than most have anticipated.</p><p>However, caution must be exercised as there are several red flags.</p><p>Firstly, the labour department said unemployment would have been 3% higher if not for misclassification errors. Secondly, the coronavirus pandemic has also led to lower reporting from businesses to government surveys, hence disruptions in the data. And if activity does not return fast, small businesses may not keep employees on their payroll much longer, having already spent the grants provided by the government. We will need at least two to three non-farm payroll (NFP) releases to get an accurate view of the US labour market.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has almost completed a round trip for the year with the index only 1% lower from where it started 2020. However, this time it is not only being led by Big Tech and biotech firms, but the most beaten-up sectors such as airlines and leisure are also surging. That is what you'd like to see as a signal of a broader economic recovery, but the big question remains \u2013 are we truly witnessing a broader economic recovery or is it a false signal from equity markets?</p><p>Whether current fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts can truly fix the economic damage wrought by the virus remains unknown. What is understood at this stage is there is enough liquidity to support the bullish scenario case. However, when looking at fundamentals there has never been such a disconnect between stock price levels and projected earnings.</p><p>While protesters around the world are seeking changes in equality, what we see in the markets is a further widening of inequality where 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. That is evident in the largest US companies as several have become larger than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic, while small and medium-sized businesses are suffering. Failing companies are also on the rise with US commercial bankruptcy filings under Chapter 11 jumping in May by 48% from a year earlier.</p><p>Perhaps at a later stage, investors will need to re-think how the social unrest will impact government policies in the form of regulations, taxes and antitrust laws. But this is not an imminent risk for the current bull market and we will leave this discussion for another time.</p><p>In the current environment, it does not seem to matter anymore if fundamentals match up with equity prices. Fear of missing out ('FOMO') and simple greed may continue to push risk assets higher and many of those who have remained on the sidelines will still want to participate.</p><p>It would be wise to consider buying portfolio insurance whether it's in the form of Gold, put options or another form of hedge, until it's clear that the economy is truly recovering at the pace suggested by risk asset classes.</p><p>For information, disclaimer and risk warning note visit: FXTM</p><p>FXTM Brand: ForexTime Limited is regulated by CySEC and licensed by the SA FSCA.

I said it was stupid and doesn't work. </p><p>He then added that the major bank he's working with are proud that this is their strategy. Now, here's the funny thing. That strategy used to work. It doesn't anymore. It used to be that a bank could adapt and change when they saw things working. They had the luxury of time. Regulatory and capital requirements meant that new competition were slow to make an impact and, if they did, the bank could just copy what they were doing. Today, regulatory and capital requirements have been lowered so that almost anyone can launch a bank in many countries, and the things they are doing with their bank are hard to copy if you have old and fragmented systems. Take my favourite example: Monzo. The difference between Monzo, Starling, Tandem and other new banks is that they began in today's world. Their core systems and therefore their data is designed to be leveraged. They can provide proactive and personalised service through algorithms. Now, take my good old bank. Their core system is designed to be a historical snapshot of transactions. They provide zero analysis or personalisation and the data gives me no knowledge of my financial lifestyle. That's why, as I blogged the other day[1], challenger banks are getting the lifestyle banking whilst old banks keep the utility transactions. Returning to that theme of being a fast follower, the old bank then needs to think about how to create a data structure that can be proactive, personalised and rich with informational analytics. There is no way the old bank can ever achieve that with a core system designed for branch operations, as most of them are. Their systems were designed for an offline world of the 1970s, and to follow new challengers fast, with their real-time analytics, is impossible with such outdated back office structures. That leads to slow following. The traditional bank has to restructure and rationalise its old systems structures, refresh them and renew them, and then add the analytics and personalised capabilities to their apps and services. That will take about five years, if they're lucky. That's not a fast follower. The fact is that if a bank is stuck in last century thinking with last century leadership, then they will think a fast follower structure still works. Instead, the reality is that such a strategy will lead to final failure, as the bank is not fit to compete with the Big Tech and FinTech firms who really get the data. Bottom-line: the world of 2025 and beyond will be dominated by firms that can analyse and leverage data for customer intelligent marketing and service. Any existing bank that has customer data in a static, fragmented, silo structure will fail in that world.
