Students wrote about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">attending protests</url> and learning to be anti-racist; about their parents getting laid off and people they knew <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">dying from Covid-19</url>; about their own experiences with racism and \u201cwhite fragility\u201d; about going back to school and learning from home; about toppling monuments and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">renaming institutions</url>; about video calling, letter writing, bird-watching and pandemic hugging; about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">essential workers</url>, \u201canti-maskers\u201d and the meaning of freedom. </p><p>With candor, nuance and introspection, teenagers gave us insight into their unique experience of navigating this tumultuous year. Our winner this week, our 10th and final week of the contest, does so exceptionally well. Congratulations to Ava Isabella Kendra Haddock, as well as to our many runners-up and honorable mentions.</p><p>Before you read Ava\u2019s essay, we want to share some reflections from a few student participants and judges about their experiences with the 2020 Summer Reading Contest. </p><p>Reflections From Student Participants</p><p>This year, we put <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">a call out to students</url> to tell us about what it was like to participate in the Summer Reading Contest. They told us how reading and reacting to The New York Times these past 10 weeks has helped them learn about themselves; made them more empathetic; opened them up to new perspectives and ideas; turned them into better readers and writers; and motivated them to share their thoughts and opinions with the world. </p><p>And many of them noted that the contest was especially important to them this summer \u2014 a summer where they were stuck at home, alone, trying to make sense of turbulent headlines week after week. </p><p>Ethan shared that reading The Times kept him entertained and informed about the world while sheltering at home: </p><p>It surprised me as to how well reading articles and writing over the arduous quarantine helped me keep my sanity. During the 10-week contest, I have obtained so much more knowledge of the world I live in. </p><p>Did you know that the first dinosaur ever discovered, Megalosaurus, was found by William Buckland in 1819? Or that the largest tree ever, the giant sequoia, measures 52,500 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters) in volume? I have been able to experience the wonder of the ocean sitting in my tiny room, and feel the pain of a medieval torture device whilst sitting on a massage chair.</p><p>If it weren\u2019t for these articles, my knowledge of the Black Lives Matter protests would have been unbelievably limited. My understanding of the current pandemic and its effects on the world would be incredibly hindered. I cannot emphasize how reading articles of people helping others in this strange time kept restoring my faith in humanity.</p><p>Ava wrote that the contest helped her feel connected in this time of social isolation:</p><p>This year\u2019s summer reading contest has helped me learn not only about the world around me, but about myself. After seeing other students\u2019 responses on race, the teenage experience, and the coronavirus, I felt a little less alone about my complicated feelings during this tumultuous year. After all, there has never been a time in my life during which it\u2019s been easier to fall into social isolation. However, because the articles I chose to write about were those that I could easily relate to and express my opinion on, I found comfort in my weekly submissions.</p><p>And Rishi wanted to thank all the participants for making his summer at home a little more enjoyable:</p><p>I\u2019d like to personally thank The New York Times for providing me, along with thousands of teenagers across the world, with a platform to express my thoughts on everything that\u2019s going on in the world right now. Although, these past 10 weeks were supposedly called a \u201ccontest,\u201d I think a more fitting way to describe it would be an \u201ceye-opening experience.\u201d </p><p>I just loved seeing what other kids my age were saying about pressing issues. In fact, I learned a lot from what other people had to say about topics ranging from racism to anti-maskers to cancel culture. I was able to expand my own viewpoints in a way that I never could\u2019ve imagined. So, all I can say is thank you to everyone who participated for enriching my stay-at-home summer and I\u2019m looking forward to participating next year.</p><p>Reflections From Our Judges</p><p>We also asked our judges, who come from across The Times and educational organizations, to share observations about the entries they read and offer advice for student writers. </p><p>Annissa Hambouz, an educator and longtime contributor to The Learning Network who has judged this contest for many years, noted admirable qualities in this year\u2019s participants: </p><p>As writers, they often display a nuanced understanding of politics and global events and offer solid critical takes on the news and opinion pieces themselves. However, it is the thoughtful self-awareness, empathy and concern for our future reflected in these essays that reveal just how well equipped young people are to face the challenges before us. Older generations have much to learn from these future leaders.</p><p>Several judges said that the best essays did not just simply summarize the pieces they read, watched or listened to, but made personal connections to them. Ken Paul, an editor at The Times, explained: </p><p>The entries that impressed me most tended to be those that reflected personal engagement with the articles, not just as readers but also as students uncertain about schools\u2019 reopening, or as victims of bullying, or as would-be hajjis, or as grieving children or grandchildren.</p><p>Emma Weber, a former participant in our annual Summer Reading Contest, shared this perspective on the writing she read:</p><p>I was on the other side of the screen just a few years back in 2017, when I got a runner-up and a few honorable mention placements, plus a whole lot of experience uncovering my voice and applying it to the world around me. Having read through hundreds of entries, I am blown away by how well this year\u2019s participants are doing just that. This summer has been such a pivotal one in terms of social justice and change, and it is brilliant to see so many students from across the world chipping in what they think such change ought to look like.</p><p>And she offered a piece of advice:  </p><p>I know first hand that the Summer Reading Contest has the ability to change the way one engages in the news \u2014 I went from passively reading to actively thinking and questioning. The more you reflect on what is going on in the world and what interests you about it, the more you will understand your place within it. I urge all those who enjoyed participating this summer to continue reading, reflecting and writing.</p><p>If you liked participating in this contest, check back in June of 2021, since it\u2019ll be back then for a 12th year. In the meantime, we invite you to participate in our many <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">other contests</url> for teenagers, and to respond to our daily <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">writing prompts</url> anytime you like.</p><p>And now, our finalists for this week:</p><p>Winner</p><p>Ava Isabella Kendra Haddock, 16, from Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, Calif., chose an article headlined \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">The Nation Wanted to Eat Out Again. Everyone Has Paid the Price</url>\u201d and wrote:</p><p>In June, I joined the official work force as a busser. As adults with health fears leave, students like me fill jobs as everything from lifeguards to child-care providers. Poetically, you could argue that student employees valiantly enforce regulations with an often hostile and polarized public, doing the work necessary to keep the community running. You could also say that we selfishly enable a broken system, and put our families at risk. As Covid-19 hot spots emerge in restaurants like mine, they expose the uncomfortable moral gray area of choosing to work. </p><p>In comparison to more essential jobs, student jobs seem frivolous. We are the most expendable workers in the country, but also the people at the frontline of a nationwide battle. As I clean up birthday dinners and vaguely illegal live-music nights, I want to quit. Most customers, and even my boss, act with little regard to public safety. Trying to enforce regulations feels like trying to stop a tidal wave of disregard with a bucket. </p><p>But the false facade of safety enforced by laughing bartenders and smiling customers is alluring. Fears of financial insecurity also smooth over most remaining health concerns. Besides, if I quit, there will be little impact. I\u2019m easily replaceable. </p><p>Every time I work, I choose to roll the dice. When I talk about the summer of 2020, I\u2019ll say I marched, and I\u2019ll say I worked. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be proud.</p><p>Runners-Up</p><p>Adora on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">Final Meals at Closing Restaurants: \u2018I Will Dream of Those Dumplings\u2019</url>\u201d</p><p>Dalya on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">The Doctor From Nazi Germany and the Search for Life on Mars</url>\u201d</p><p>Esther on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">We All Speak a Language That Will Go Extinct</url>\u201d</p><p>Fiona on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">Cooking Through a Crisis With Grandma, Virtually</url>\u201d</p><p>Fiona on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">Uighur Exiles Push for Court Case Accusing China of Genocide</url>\u201d</p><p>Janine Shum on \u201cNagasaki Urges Nuke Ban on 75th Anniversary of U.S. Atomic Bombing\u201d</p><p>Katelyn on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">Today\u2019s Activism: Spontaneous, Leaderless, but Not Without Aim</url>\u201d</p><p>Katharine Turcke on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">Boys Are Boys and Girls Are Girls\u2019: Idaho Is First State to Bar Some Transgender Athletes</url>\u201d</p><p>Liz on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">In Poland, the Rainbow Flag Is Wrapped Up in a Broader Culture War</url>\u201d</p><p>Moses on \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/summer-reading-winners\">Aunt Jemima Is Gone.

But amid proposals that attracted both acclaim and opprobrium in equal measure was one that was barely noticed. In looking for ways of sustaining new forms of journalism, Corbyn       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/full-text-jeremy-corbyns-2018-alternative-mactaggart-lecture/\">invoked the possibility</url> of charity funding: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We should look at granting charitable status for some local, investigative and public interest journalism.

Local newspapers are closing in some areas, leaving a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/CMCP/local-news.pdf\">democratic deficit</url>\" of people less well informed about their own hospitals, schools, transport, housing and so on, while local courts, councils, police forces and other local bodies attract very limited or no journalistic scrutiny and are therefore less accountable to local citizens.</p><p>The notion of charitable funding as a source of alternative revenue has been floated before, with politicians, academics, journalists and third sector groups all pushing for such an initiative. It is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/foundations-and-the-foundation-of-a-new-way-of-funding-journalism/s2/a697598/\">well established in the US</url>, where many non-profit journalism enterprises benefit substantially from philanthropy. In 2012, the UK's House of Lords Communications Committee, looking at the parlous state of funding for investigative journalism, urged the Charity Commission to provide greater clarity about what media activities might be classed as charitable under current law. More importantly,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201012/ldselect/ldcomuni/256/25608.htm#n152\">it encouraged</url> the government to reform charity law as \"the only way in which certainty in this area could be achieved\".</p><p>In its 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/8907/attachments/original/1429028133/Liberal_Democrat_General_Election_Manifesto_2015.pdf?1429028133\">manifesto</url>, in a section on democracy and citizenship, the Liberal Democrats promised to allow \"non-profit local media outlets to obtain charitable status where the public interest is being served\". In academia, the idea has been explored in various roundtable meetings, papers and publications, including our own as part of a 2013-14 AHRC-funded project       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mediaplurality.com/\">on media plurality and ownership</url>.</p><p>As part of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/our-research/impact-charity-and-tax-lawregulation-not-profit-news-organizations\">comparative multi-authored report</url> for the Reuters Institute and the Yale Information Society Project in 2016, one of us (Judith Townend) set out the ways in which news and journalism had been charitably funded in the UK within the constraints of the current system - through, for example, the creation of separate trusts that fund the charitable activity of a journalistic operation.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://journalismfundersforum.com/uploads/downloads/jff_london_report.pdf\">Another report</url> from the Cass Business School in 2017 also provided current examples of UK journalism benefiting from philanthropy.</p><p>But many of these models are clunky and overly restrictive and do not allow organisations to enjoy the full benefits of charitable status. Potential donors are likely to be discouraged. Many non-profits, which clearly contribute to a better informed citizenship and a more vibrant democracy, are either pushed back by the Charity Commission or are put off entirely by the laborious and costly application process. <url normalizedValue=\"http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1158683&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0\">Full Fact</url> - a clear example of democratic engagement in the public interest - took many years and several thwarted attempts to persuade the commission of its charitable merits. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism faced similar difficulties; although it has not secured status itself, a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1179275&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0\">newly registered Trust</url> will fund charitable elements of its work.</p><p>A more flexible approach, that recognises certain types of journalistic activity as fulfilling charitable objects and delivering public benefit, would allow organisations to undertake public interest journalism that is difficult to sustain commercially. But so far, there has been little public discussion or political support.</p><p>This could change with the establishment of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/call-for-evidence-on-sustainable-high-quality-journalism-in-the-uk\">Cairncross Review</url>, set up by Matt Hancock during his brief stint as culture secretary. Under the leadership of Dame Frances Cairncross, the review is designed to investigate \"how to sustain the production and distribution of high-quality journalism in a changing market\".</p><p>While there are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.byline.com/column/68/article/2272\">some concerns</url> that the review might be hijacked by incumbent corporate interests seeking subsidies for their existing operations (fuelled by the existence of several \"old school\" newspaper hacks on the expert panel), there is also optimism that some genuinely creative and radical ideas might be forthcoming - including greater discretion for charitable recognition of certain kinds of journalism. Cairncross herself referred to the notion of \"philanthropic support of some sort\" when recently interviewed on the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bcddwt\">Media Show</url>.</p><p>There are clearly issues to be resolved, not least who will assess whether charitably funded journalistic output genuinely meets charitable criteria and remains within legal constraints on political activity. The Charity Commission itself might find the prospect too politically sensitive, and the current press self-regulator IPSO is much too close to (and owned by) established press interests to be appropriate for the task. Communications regulator Ofcom is one obvious candidate.</p><p>But with some creative thinking and greater political will, it may at last be possible to open up some much-needed additional funding for journalism - which will not only enrich democracy but also provide outlets for talented journalists who increasingly struggle to find sustainable employment within traditional media outlets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Conversation disclosure: Jo Adetunji, deputy editor, is a member of the Cairncross Review panel.

Understanding the importance of this moment, Vice President Joe Biden has proposed a $2 trillion [2]climate pla[3]n[4] designed to transition the economy away from greenhouse gas emissions. The plan calls for an emission-free power sector by 2030, as well as an environmental justice component to address how climate policies have failed communities of color. Parts of Biden's plan will require new legislation and others will deputize numerous federal agencies. </p><p>But a major share of responsibility for success will fall on the Environmental Protection Agency. Twenty years of stagnation, followed by a decade of austerity, have left the EPA dangerously understaffed, even as its responsibilities have grown. For Biden's climate agenda to succeed, his administration must commit to reversing this trend, by massively increasing staffing and funding for the EPA, and empowering the agency to realize the dreams of its founding.A Growing Hole, Not a Growing Whole By any measure, the EPA has massively improved [5]air quality[6] since its inception. If the EPA's successes haven't delivered the full set of environmental priorities, it's because, like too many other other federal agencies, the agency's lofty responsibilities and aspirations have never been matched by appropriate funding or staffing levels. The first EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus explained[7] in a retrospective look at his tenure, 'There probably isn't enough money in the whole federal budget to do everything they assign to EPA.' During the 1980's, which included Ruckelshaus's second term, EPA staffing levels rose, from 13,000 employees in 1980 to 16,000 in 1990. For the 20 years after that, staffing levels largely stagnated between 17,000 and 18,000, spreading the growing responsibility for policing pollution across an increasingly thinly stretched staff, even as the U.S. economy nearly tripled in size (from $5 trillion to $15 trillion in GDP) and population rose by 20 percent. Even as resources remained flat, the EPA's responsibilities expanded again when the Supreme Court concluded[8] in 2007 that the Clean Air Act required the agency to regulate greenhouse gases. Although the Bush administration resisted[9] this imperative, President Obama came into office promising[10] decisive action on climate change, as well as a general re-commitment to environmental protections rolled back in the Bush era. While legislative efforts to implement cap and trade sputtered[11] from a mixture of limited political attention, industry pushback, and Republican bad faith[12], the EPA took on an ambitious[13] agenda. It promulgated rules designed to cut back on the two biggest sources of CO2 emissions: cars[14] and power plants[15]. It expanded[16] federal protections for wetlands and waterways. It implemented new limits on smokestack pollution, further hastening the decline of coal-fired power plants. And it recommitted[17] the EPA to environmental justice, reinstating a focus on racial and economic disparities that the Bush administration had neglected. But even as the EPA notched notable policy triumphs under President Obama, its foundation was being eroded by a lack of focus on personnel. Driven by the rise of a nihilist Republican House majority uninterested in governing, President Obama actualized his first term embrace[18] of deficit reduction and signed[19] the Budget Control Act, a landmark piece of austerity legislation that he would soon come to regret[20] as deeply detrimental to his presidency. The law created a 'fiscal cliff' in 2013, a sort of mutually assured destruction of defense and domestic spending cuts that Democratic leadership expected would bring Republicans back to the negotiating table. But, as so often happened, the Republicans showed that their real interest[21] was denying the president any meaningful accomplishment, forcing major, untargeted cuts to crucial agency budgets known as the sequester. For the EPA, the results of the sequester and austerity would be catastrophic. President Obama inherited an EPA with about 17,000 employees, its lowest level since 1991, and this didn't budge throughout the first term. Stagnation became a pleasant memory as austerity led to buyouts, slowed hiring and attrition, with the number of employees falling below 16,000 for the first time since 1989. Staffing levels continued to careen downward from there, setting new lows every year. These cuts left agency staff demoralized[22], and thus particularly susceptible to attacks by Trumpist leadership bent on rendering it ineffective. Indeed, although the EPA's staffing levels have plumbed new lows under Trump, the majority of its personnel attrition since 2008 came during President Obama's second term. Even these cuts understate the magnitude of the risk to the EPA: Hiring freezes mean that the EPA has grown grayer over the last decade, with the proportion of employees over 60 nearly doubling since 2008 and the number of employees under 40 falling by a quarter, from 4,000 to 3,000. This attrition had impacts beyond morale. Most poignantly, an EPA inspector general report[23] shows the poisoning of Flint's water supply came about in part from a lack of EPA oversight. Even as this crisis unfolded, the number of environmental protection specialists in Region 5, the staff who would be responsible for frontline oversight of water quality, fell by 20 percent from 2008 to 2016, with even sharper attrition thereafter. Again, these personnel losses came as the EPA made a serious effort to regulate greenhouse gases, a major expansion in its mandate that should have come with growing, not declining staffing levels.Lessons for a Biden AdministrationDespite attrition, the EPA is still the most important agency for implementing the Biden climate plan. A robust, empowered EPA will enforce existing policies, reinstate the Trump administration's rollbacks, and push new frontiers in regulation and enforcement. To give the climate plan and the EPA the best chance for success, the Biden administration should: Avoid the temptation to engage in austerity politics. Vice President Biden will come to power in the midst of a massive recession, amplified by an insufficient stimulus. The immediate need will be to spend money to support those thrown out of work by this unprecedented crisis. Framing the climate plan as part of a broader stimulus[24] package is a wise decision that will tie two popular initiatives together. But Biden will also come to power following an administration that ran up[25] massive budget deficits and grew the national debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations. Soon, Republicans and official Washington will begin to shamelessly pivot to calls for fiscal responsibility and prioritizing balanced budgets over the needs of the American people. Unfortunately, the Biden campaign has given mixed signals[26] about whether it will accept this framing. While Biden may grasp[27] the magnitude of the moment and the scale of what will be needed to address it, there are negative signs from public statements[28] by advisors seeking to temper expectations for how much the administration will spend, as well as the involvement of old deficit hands like Erskine Bowles[29] and Bruce Reed[30]. Biden had a first-hand view of how austerity policies hobbled the Obama administration without yielding either political or economic benefits. He should follow his own instincts and reject fear of budget deficits or a national debt that has never been cheaper to service as reasons for limiting his robust policy goals. This should be a guiding principle across the government, but especially in the environmental realm, where the time to avoid irreversible change is growing very short. Set a goal of 25,000 employees at the EPA. If the EPA is going to succeed, the Biden administration will need to think big about how much staff it needs to adequately develop and implement policy, monitor compliance and enforce the environmental laws. Since 2008, GDP has grown from about $14 trillion to $21 trillion in 2019, a 50 percent increase. If the EPA's staffing had grown commensurate with the economy over that period, it would leave the agency with about 25,000 permanent employees. This represents an 80 percent increase in the size of the agency from its 2019 levels. Not every part of the EPA needs to scale with the economy: Scientific research and policy decisions can be made with similarly sized teams. Deindustrialization and the growth of clean energy means that the economy has shifted over the past decade to less polluting sectors. But on the other side of the ledger, the EPA has added a number of new policy and enforcement areas to its docket since 2010, and will continue to do so under the Biden administration's climate plan. It will also have a backlog of cases that fell by the wayside due to lack of resources and aggressive neglect by Trump political appointees. For instance, thousands of American cities beyond Flint are likely afflicted[31] by lead poisoning, a racial justice crisis the EPA will need to take the reins on as quickly as possible. Finally, federal government hiring can be an arduous process. Fully staffing the EPA will take years, years where the economy will keep growing and its responsibilities will keep rising. Setting an ambitious target now is the only way to ensure the EPA's capacity keeps up with its mandate in the years to come. Include $2.2 billion in EPA personnel funding in the next budget omnibus. Agencies can't hire employees unless Congress authorizes money for them to spend. Congress funds the EPA's general operations with lump-sum appropriations, leaving it to the agency's discretion how it allocates the spending between personnel and other necessary expenses. To help with long-term planning, Congress also gives the EPA 18 months to spend the appropriation. In 2019, the EPA spent about $1.8 billion on permanent staff. Increasing the EPA's staffing by 80 percent will require a commensurate increase in personnel funding. Over 1.5 years, that would be $2.2 billion, money that could be added to a government funding bill expected in early 2021. Congress should require the EPA to spend the newly allocated money on personnel, but give agency leadership flexibility about directing that to new hires, retention bonuses to improve morale among existing staff, or recruitment costs required to actually implement massive hiring. This is a tiny sum of the $2 trillion that the Biden administration plans to allocate to climate, and without a well-funded EPA, other initiatives will lack maximal impact as polluters continue to operate with limited oversight. Such an investment will pay dividends that even the most blinkered advocates of cost-benefit analysis have to acknowledge. The Biden campaign has called for a bold approach on climate, one that may be the world's last hope to keep climate change relatively in check. For this plan to succeed, the Biden administration will need to keep its goals and constituency in mind as it rejects calls for austerity in a time of crisis, while also focusing on the nitty gritty, like agency staffing and funding, that will underpin the success of its plans.

Understanding the importance of this moment, Vice President Joe Biden has proposed a $2 trillion [2]climate pla[3]n[4] designed to transition the economy away from greenhouse gas emissions. The plan calls for an emission-free power sector by 2030, as well as an environmental justice component to address how climate policies have failed communities of color. Parts of Biden's plan will require new legislation and others will deputize numerous federal agencies. </p><p>But a major share of responsibility for success will fall on the Environmental Protection Agency.Twenty years of stagnation, followed by a decade of austerity, have left the EPA dangerously understaffed, even as its responsibilities have grown. For Biden's climate agenda to succeed, his administration must commit to reversing this trend, by massively increasing staffing and funding for the EPA, and empowering the agency to realize the dreams of its founding. A Growing Hole, Not a Growing Whole  By any measure, the EPA has massively improved [5]air quality[6] since its inception. If the EPA's successes haven't delivered the full set of environmental priorities, it's because, like too many other other federal agencies, the agency's lofty responsibilities and aspirations have never been matched by appropriate funding or staffing levels. The first EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus explained[7] in a retrospective look at his tenure, 'There probably isn't enough money in the whole federal budget to do everything they assign to EPA.'During the 1980's, which included Ruckelshaus's second term, EPA staffing levels rose, from 13,000 employees in 1980 to 16,000 in 1990. For the 20 years after that, staffing levels largely stagnated between 17,000 and 18,000, spreading the growing responsibility for policing pollution across an increasingly thinly stretched staff, even as the U.S. economy nearly tripled in size (from $5 trillion to $15 trillion in GDP) and population rose by 20 percent.Even as resources remained flat, the EPA's responsibilities expanded again when the Supreme Court concluded[8] in 2007 that the Clean Air Act required the agency to regulate greenhouse gases. Although the Bush administration resisted[9] this imperative, President Obama came into office promising[10] decisive action on climate change, as well as a general re-commitment to environmental protections rolled back in the Bush era.While legislative efforts to implement cap and trade sputtered[11] from a mixture of limited political attention, industry pushback, and Republican bad faith[12], the EPA took on an ambitious[13] agenda. It promulgated rules designed to cut back on the two biggest sources of CO2 emissions: cars[14] and power plants[15]. It expanded[16] federal protections for wetlands and waterways. It implemented new limits on smokestack pollution, further hastening the decline of coal-fired power plants. And it recommitted[17] the EPA to environmental justice, reinstating a focus on racial and economic disparities that the Bush administration had neglected.But even as the EPA notched notable policy triumphs under President Obama, its foundation was being eroded by a lack of focus on personnel. Driven by the rise of a nihilist Republican House majority uninterested in governing, President Obama actualized his first term embrace[18] of deficit reduction and signed[19] the Budget Control Act, a landmark piece of austerity legislation that he would soon come to regret[20] as deeply detrimental to his presidency. The law created a 'fiscal cliff' in 2013, a sort of mutually assured destruction of defense and domestic spending cuts that Democratic leadership expected would bring Republicans back to the negotiating table. But, as so often happened, the Republicans showed that their real interest[21] was denying the president any meaningful accomplishment, forcing major, untargeted cuts to crucial agency budgets known as the sequester. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[22]For the EPA, the results of the sequester and austerity would be catastrophic. President Obama inherited an EPA with about 17,000 employees, its lowest level since 1991, and this didn't budge throughout the first term. Stagnation became a pleasant memory as austerity led to buyouts, slowed hiring and attrition, with the number of employees falling below 16,000 for the first time since 1989. Staffing levels continued to careen downward from there, setting new lows every year.These cuts left agency staff demoralized[23], and thus particularly susceptible to attacks by Trumpist leadership bent on rendering it ineffective. Indeed, although the EPA's staffing levels have plumbed new lows under Trump, the majority of its personnel attrition since 2008 came during President Obama's second term. Even these cuts understate the magnitude of the risk to the EPA: Hiring freezes mean that the EPA has grown grayer over the last decade, with the proportion of employees over 60 nearly doubling since 2008 and the number of employees under 40 falling by a quarter, from 4,000 to 3,000.This attrition had impacts beyond morale. Most poignantly, an EPA inspector general report[24] shows the poisoning of Flint's water supply came about in part from a lack of EPA oversight. Even as this crisis unfolded, the number of environmental protection specialists in Region 5, the staff who would be responsible for frontline oversight of water quality, fell by 20 percent from 2008 to 2016, with even sharper attrition thereafter. Again, these personnel losses came as the EPA made a serious effort to regulate greenhouse gases, a major expansion in its mandate that should have come with growing, not declining staffing levels. Lessons for a Biden Administration Despite attrition, the EPA is still the most important agency for implementing the Biden climate plan. A robust, empowered EPA will enforce existing policies, reinstate the Trump administration's rollbacks, and push new frontiers in regulation and enforcement. To give the climate plan and the EPA the best chance for success, the Biden administration should:Avoid the temptation to engage in austerity politics. Vice President Biden will come to power in the midst of a massive recession, amplified by an insufficient stimulus. The immediate need will be to spend money to support those thrown out of work by this unprecedented crisis. Framing the climate plan as part of a broader stimulus[25] package is a wise decision that will tie two popular initiatives together.But Biden will also come to power following an administration that ran up[26] massive budget deficits and grew the national debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and corporations. Soon, Republicans and official Washington will begin to shamelessly pivot to calls for fiscal responsibility and prioritizing balanced budgets over the needs of the American people.Unfortunately, the Biden campaign has given mixed signals[27] about whether it will accept this framing. While Biden may grasp[28] the magnitude of the moment and the scale of what will be needed to address it, there are negative signs from public statements[29] by advisors seeking to temper expectations for how much the administration will spend, as well as the involvement of old deficit hands like Erskine Bowles[30] and Bruce Reed[31]. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[32]Biden had a first-hand view of how austerity policies hobbled the Obama administration without yielding either political or economic benefits. He should follow his own instincts and reject fear of budget deficits or a national debt that has never been cheaper to service as reasons for limiting his robust policy goals. This should be a guiding principle across the government, but especially in the environmental realm, where the time to avoid irreversible change is growing very short.Set a goal of 25,000 employees at the EPA. If the EPA is going to succeed, the Biden administration will need to think big about how much staff it needs to adequately develop and implement policy, monitor compliance and enforce the environmental laws. Since 2008, GDP has grown from about $14 trillion to $21 trillion in 2019, a 50 percent increase. If the EPA's staffing had grown commensurate with the economy over that period, it would leave the agency with about 25,000 permanent employees. This represents an 80 percent increase in the size of the agency from its 2019 levels.Not every part of the EPA needs to scale with the economy: Scientific research and policy decisions can be made with similarly sized teams. Deindustrialization and the growth of clean energy means that the economy has shifted over the past decade to less polluting sectors. But on the other side of the ledger, the EPA has added a number of new policy and enforcement areas to its docket since 2010, and will continue to do so under the Biden administration's climate plan. It will also have a backlog of cases that fell by the wayside due to lack of resources and aggressive neglect by Trump political appointees. For instance, thousands of American cities beyond Flint are likely afflicted[33] by lead poisoning, a racial justice crisis the EPA will need to take the reins on as quickly as possible. Finally, federal government hiring can be an arduous process. Fully staffing the EPA will take years, years where the economy will keep growing and its responsibilities will keep rising. Setting an ambitious target now is the only way to ensure the EPA's capacity keeps up with its mandate in the years to come.Include $2.2 billion in EPA personnel funding in the next budget omnibus. Agencies can't hire employees unless Congress authorizes money for them to spend. Congress funds the EPA's general operations with lump-sum appropriations, leaving it to the agency's discretion how it allocates the spending between personnel and other necessary expenses. To help with long-term planning, Congress also gives the EPA 18 months to spend the appropriation. In 2019, the EPA spent about $1.8 billion on permanent staff.Increasing the EPA's staffing by 80 percent will require a commensurate increase in personnel funding. Over 1.5 years, that would be $2.2 billion, money that could be added to a government funding bill expected in early 2021. Congress should require the EPA to spend the newly allocated money on personnel, but give agency leadership flexibility about directing that to new hires, retention bonuses to improve morale among existing staff, or recruitment costs required to actually implement massive hiring.This is a tiny sum of the $2 trillion that the Biden administration plans to allocate to climate, and without a well-funded EPA, other initiatives will lack maximal impact as polluters continue to operate with limited oversight. Such an investment will pay dividends that even the most blinkered advocates of cost-benefit analysis have to acknowledge.The Biden campaign has called for a bold approach on climate, one that may be the world's last hope to keep climate change relatively in check. For this plan to succeed, the Biden administration will need to keep its goals and constituency in mind as it rejects calls for austerity in a time of crisis, while also focusing on the nitty gritty, like agency staffing and funding, that will underpin the success of its plans.

The social distancing demanded by COVID-19 has sped up the shift to a digital economy, a boon for outfits such as Toronto-based Portag3, which specializes in identifying startups that have plans to disrupt finance. The pandemic caused a terrible recession, but anyone focused on digital technology barely noticed.</p><p>\"We've been playing offence,\" Felesky said during a Zoom interview organized by the National Crowdfunding &amp;; Fintech Association. \"We're excited about the environment right now. There are lots of opportunities.\"</p><p>Unfortunately for Canada, which, like most countries, will need all the investment it can get to recover from the coronavirus crisis, most of the opportunities that Felesky sees are elsewhere.</p><p>That's because we Canadians - and, by extension, our elected representatives - refuse to get excited about open banking, the industry term for a regulatory regime that grants control of financial information to clients rather than the financial institutions that serve them.</p><p>Without access to data, digital upstarts have little chance of stealing market share from legacy institutions, even if they offer a better service. The United Kingdom, European Union and Australia are among the jurisdictions that have adopted open banking over the past couple of years and will benefit from a first-mover advantage as a result.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, meanwhile, keeps postponing a decision on whether it intends to follow, which probably suits the established banking oligopoly just fine.</p><p>Around the time Portag3 closed its latest round of fundraising, an expert committee appointed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau was finishing up a report that was relatively enthusiastic about open banking. In January, Morneau released the review and announced additional consultations would be held in the spring. Those meetings were postponed until autumn because of the pandemic, meaning regulatory clarity is at least a year away, if not longer.</p><p>As a result, Portag3's money probably will end up in places where governments have decided to embrace the future, rather than serve the interests of legacy interests by dallying. Canada will have exposure to the digital shift in financial services thanks to the ownership stakes Portag3 and others take in various international firms. But the actual champions of global finance will continue to come from elsewhere, and their clients in Europe and Asia will be first to enjoy the benefits of better service.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're spending more time outside of Canada than inside of Canada because of some of these (regulatory) headwinds,\" Felesky said. \"It's difficult to make some of these investments believing something may occur.

The social distancing demanded by COVID-19 has sped up the shift to a digital economy, a boon for outfits such as Toronto-based Portag3, which specializes in identifying startups that have plans to disrupt finance. The pandemic caused a terrible recession, but anyone focused on digital technology barely noticed.</p><p>\"We've been playing offence,\" Felesky said during a Zoom interview organized by the National Crowdfunding &amp;; Fintech Association. \"We're excited about the environment right now. There are lots of opportunities.\"</p><p>Unfortunately for Canada, which, like most countries, will need all the investment it can get to recover from the coronavirus crisis, most of the opportunities that Felesky sees are elsewhere.</p><p>That's because we Canadians - and, by extension, our elected representatives - refuse to get excited about open banking, the industry term for a regulatory regime that grants control of financial information to clients rather than the financial institutions that serve them.</p><p>Without access to data, digital upstarts have little chance of stealing market share from legacy institutions, even if they offer a better service. The United Kingdom, European Union and Australia are among the jurisdictions that have adopted open banking over the past couple of years and will benefit from a first-mover advantage as a result.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, meanwhile, keeps postponing a decision on whether it intends to follow, which probably suits the established banking oligopoly just fine.</p><p>Around the time Portag3 closed its latest round of fundraising, an expert committee appointed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau was finishing up a report that was relatively enthusiastic about open banking. In January, Morneau released the review and announced additional consultations would be held in the spring. Those meetings were postponed until autumn because of the pandemic, meaning regulatory clarity is at least a year away, if not longer.</p><p>As a result, Portag3's money probably will end up in places where governments have decided to embrace the future, rather than serve the interests of legacy interests by dallying. Canada will have exposure to the digital shift in financial services thanks to the ownership stakes Portag3 and others take in various international firms. But the actual champions of global finance will continue to come from elsewhere, and their clients in Europe and Asia will be first to enjoy the benefits of better service.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're spending more time outside of Canada than inside of Canada because of some of these (regulatory) headwinds,\" Felesky said. \"It's difficult to make some of these investments believing something may occur. We just don't have any capital in businesses that are dependent on open banking.\"</p><p>There is a strongly held view among fintech advocates that the big banks are using their influence to delay regulatory changes that would entice new challengers for as long as they can.</p><p>Given the banking oligopoly's outsized role in the federal government's COVID-19 rescue, it's fair to wonder if it will have even greater sway over the feds once the emergency is over. The argument that the guarantee of financial stability justifies protecting the largest institutions from competition will be strengthened by Bay Street's ability to keep many mortgage holders and smaller companies afloat during the crisis.</p><p>But a new generation of finance entrepreneurs think decades of coddling have left the big banks too risk averse to be successful in the digital economy. They have been slow to adapt, leaving themselves vulnerable to tech behemoths such as Amazaon.com Inc. and Shopify Inc. that are steadily adding financial services such as small-business lending to their core offerings.</p><p>\"Canada has a history of using its oligopolies, whether it's telecommunications or financial services, for warding off competition,\" Corey Gross, chief executive of Toronto-based Sensibill Inc., which uses artificial intelligence to process receipts, said in an interview. \"The financial institutions here are going to face a reckoning.\"</p><p>Sensibill, backed by Toronto-based Radical Ventures Investments Inc., doesn't necessarily need open banking to be successful.

The social distancing demanded by COVID-19 has sped up the shift to a digital economy, a boon for outfits such as Toronto-based Portag3, which specializes in identifying startups that have plans to disrupt finance. The pandemic caused a terrible recession, but anyone focused on digital technology barely noticed.</p><p>\"We've been playing offence,\" Felesky said during a Zoom interview organized by the National Crowdfunding &amp;; Fintech Association. \"We're excited about the environment right now. There are lots of opportunities.\"</p><p>Unfortunately for Canada, which, like most countries, will need all the investment it can get to recover from the coronavirus crisis, most of the opportunities that Felesky sees are elsewhere.</p><p>That's because we Canadians - and, by extension, our elected representatives - refuse to get excited about open banking, the industry term for a regulatory regime that grants control of financial information to clients rather than the financial institutions that serve them.</p><p>Without access to data, digital upstarts have little chance of stealing market share from legacy institutions, even if they offer a better service. The United Kingdom, European Union and Australia are among the jurisdictions that have adopted open banking over the past couple of years and will benefit from a first-mover advantage as a result.</p><p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, meanwhile, keeps postponing a decision on whether it intends to follow, which probably suits the established banking oligopoly just fine.</p><p>Around the time Portag3 closed its latest round of fundraising, an expert committee appointed by Finance Minister Bill Morneau was finishing up a report that was relatively enthusiastic about open banking. In January, Morneau released the review and announced additional consultations would be held in the spring. Those meetings were postponed until autumn because of the pandemic, meaning regulatory clarity is at least a year away, if not longer.</p><p>As a result, Portag3's money probably will end up in places where governments have decided to embrace the future, rather than serve the interests of legacy interests by dallying. Canada will have exposure to the digital shift in financial services thanks to the ownership stakes Portag3 and others take in various international firms. But the actual champions of global finance will continue to come from elsewhere, and their clients in Europe and Asia will be first to enjoy the benefits of better service.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we're spending more time outside of Canada than inside of Canada because of some of these (regulatory) headwinds,\" Felesky said. \"It's difficult to make some of these investments believing something may occur. We just don't have any capital in businesses that are dependent on open banking.\"</p><p>There is a strongly held view among fintech advocates that the big banks are using their influence to delay regulatory changes that would entice new challengers for as long as they can.</p><p>Given the banking oligopoly's outsized role in the federal government's COVID-19 rescue, it's fair to wonder if it will have even greater sway over the feds once the emergency is over. The argument that the guarantee of financial stability justifies protecting the largest institutions from competition will be strengthened by Bay Street's ability to keep many mortgage holders and smaller companies afloat during the crisis.</p><p>But a new generation of finance entrepreneurs think decades of coddling have left the big banks too risk averse to be successful in the digital economy. They have been slow to adapt, leaving themselves vulnerable to tech behemoths such as Amazaon.com Inc. and Shopify Inc. that are steadily adding financial services such as small-business lending to their core offerings.</p><p>\"Canada has a history of using its oligopolies, whether it's telecommunications or financial services, for warding off competition,\" Corey Gross, chief executive of Toronto-based Sensibill Inc., which uses artificial intelligence to process receipts, said in an interview. \"The financial institutions here are going to face a reckoning.\"</p><p>Sensibill, backed by Toronto-based Radical Ventures Investments Inc., doesn't necessarily need open banking to be successful. Last month, the company announced an agreement with JPMorgan Chase &amp;; Co. to process receipts for the 38 million people who use the Chase banking app.</p><p>Still, Gross said his business would be stronger if the legacy banks felt competitive pressure to offer their clients the latest digital technology.</p><p>\"You can't say they aren't aware of it and they aren't doing anything about it. They are,\" he said. \"But the urgency is not there yet. Bringing more competition to Canada, either from big tech or by an explosion of fintech brought about by open banking, would create more urgency.\"</p><p>There will need to be more urgency in Ottawa, too, and some of that will have to be directed by us, so call your member of Parliament.

Who in the media is really going to call him on it? Think about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've looked into this, my friends, and here is what I discovered. This illegal immigration crisis, well, it's not even a crisis. It's not inhumane. The way we are treating these tens of thousands of illegals dumped on us is what's inhumane. Not illegal, inhumane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, to the mainstream media, it's not even about illegals at all. They won't even use the term \"illegal.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, more on that in a second. For now, I want you to concentrate on how they're covering this story - not what they are including, what they are omitting. It is the way they frame this argument. It is the way they discuss this issue by never using the word \"illegal.\"</p><p>Well, they rid themselves of the nuisance of having to explain all of these thousands of people who are breaking the law, our laws, our country. No, no. You see, they're not the problem. We are! And Republicans, well, they're even worse. They're not patriots, they're bigots. They're not against illegal immigration, now, they're just against all immigration. It's morphed into that.</p><p>Get ready for this, because what I'm about to show you proves it. These are unedited, undoctored, very real clips, headlines, stories from a sampling of news items on the ongoing illegal immigration mess that never use the word \"illegal\" once. Not once.</p><p>The Washington Post, June 30th: \"It's OK that Congress won't act on immigration.\"</p><p>The L.A. Times, July 5th: \"A mounting backlog of immigration courts...\"</p><p>BusinessWeek, this week: \"With immigration reform dead on Capitol Hill, President Obama says he will use his executive authority to make changes to the law himself.\"</p><p>NBC News' Matt Lauer urging viewers to share their thoughts on Twitter by calling these latest immigrants - not illegal immigrants - immigrants by #RefugeeRiders and they are never to be called \"illegal\" at all. NBC choosing instead the term \"undocumented\". Ditto CBS.</p><p>In fact, the L.A. Times and the Associated Press have announced a ban on the term \"illegal immigrants.\" They say it broadly and unfairly labels a large group of people.</p><p>Well, that makes things easy, doesn't it? Sort of like dispensing with the term \"global warming\" after a few harsh winters then ta da! It's climate change. Who can argue with that?</p><p>So now by saying we have an immigration crisis, you could say that anyone who's against these waves of illegals coming here are anti-immigrant or worse, anti- I don't know - human being. Suddenly, they're not for illegal immigration reform, they're against immigration reform. Immigration reform.</p><p>Leave out the illegal part and you might almost forget the billions we are spending on processing these tens of thousands of illegal kids dumped in this country into thinking that they are citizens of this country. They are not. And those opposed to keeping these noncitizens here are racist. They are not.</p><p>You see, when you leave out words you don't like, you can kind of say anything you do like. But let me tell you something. I can call myself \"calorically-challenged\" instead of \"fat\" to make myself feel good but that doesn't make me any less fat. So fat chance it'll make me anymore aware.</p><p>But those are my thoughts. I'd love to hear yours. Use #Cavuto and I'll share them with the world.</p><p>First to Accuracy in Media Editor, Roger Aronoff.</p><p>Roger, this started as a curious little project on my part - just seeing what I could get just hearing and reading media stories - and it's true. \"Illegal\" doesn't happen. It's a word you can't find. What happened?</p><p>ROGER ARONOFF, ACCURACY IN MEDIA EDITOR: Oh, you're exactly right, Neil. Great to be with you today and it was a great setup. Yes. For instance, the Associated Press took it out of their style book so that you can no longer say \"illegal aliens\" because it's too judgmental and it might hurt someone's feelings so they've just removed it from the lexicon. It's only used to describe actions and not people. And that just serves--.</p><p>CAVUTO: But they will freely write stories of - those critical of what we're doing right now at the border - they can still be called \"bigots\". They can still be called \"obstructionists\" or God knows what. But \"illegal\" somehow is now taken on a bad connotation and who are we afraid of offending again?</p><p>ARONOFF: Well, that's right. What's going on here, I believe, is that there's an agenda. They are pushing for this so-called comprehensive immigration reform also known as amnesty and they also want to protect President Obama. They have a lot invested in him. So this is what they're doing. I mean, we're looking at this 50,000 children that have come over but there's really even a much larger story. There was a piece in the New York Times last week and this is the New York Times that acknowledged that since April alone, there have been 240,000 adult migrants - they call them - that have come across as well and most of them are just released to go where they want to in the U.S.</p><p>CAVUTO: And back and forth and back and forth. The recidivism is beyond the pale. But here's what is amazing to me. When you ignore the obvious and you've written about this brilliantly, then you don't do what should be obvious. When you talk about the rights of illegals or illegals have to be given a license to drive and illegals - in some communities - they even have to be given the right to vote. In New York City, they're debating that as we speak and I'm thinking to myself, \"What part of 'illegal' do they not understand?\" What part of 'noncitizen' do they not understand? What part of stealing their way across the border for whatever reason do they not understand? And then I'm thinking of all the well-intended immigrants who are coming here and going through the process, who also write me and say, \"What the heck?\"</p><p>ARONOFF: You're absolutely right. I mean, this is the worst it's for the legal aliens - the people who do the right thing and get in line and come here - and this flood of illegal immigrants has created massive headaches for them and for many of us who are really very pro-immigrant but anti- illegal immigrant, it's - this is a disaster and it's really a manufactured crisis. You look back at a couple of things. Obama's trying to blame this back on this 2008 law that really, there was the 2012 DACA - Deferred Action for Childhood Admissions - and the other thing is that we know there was a contract put out in January of this year that specified 65,00 children coming here calling for escorts to bring them here. So they have known this exactly and this is really a manufactured crisis and now, even this week, we've seen this other kind of maneuver where first they put out that it was going to be 1.8 billion, and then all of a sudden, no, it's 3.7 billion. They've tried to find--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, it'll go steadily higher than that, Roger, But your points are all well taken as usual. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>Oh, by the way, I was thinking of Nancy Pelosi also changing the fact it's not a border issue, that this is an Americas issue - North America, Central America, South America. We're all one. Who knew? I had to go back and look at my (INAUDIBLE) now.</p><p>All right. To former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West who's seen and heard enough.</p><p>What do you think of this, Congressman? Illegal, no more, don't use it?</p><p>FMR. REP. ALLEN WEST, (R) FLORIDA: Well, Neil, you hit the nail on the head when you start looking at how liberal progressives changed the lexicon. They are not \"illegal immigrants\". They're \"undocumented workers.\" You don't have \"drug dealers\", you have \"unlicensed pharmacists\". You don't even have \"combat operations\", you have \"overseas contingency operations.\" You have \"man-caused disasters\" instead of \"terrorist attacks\". And in recently, just out in California, we don't have \"husband and wife\" anymore, we have \"spouse one and spouse two\".</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>WEST: So you're right. As you change the language, then you make the thing that is obvious and the problem that should be dealt with completely un-dealable. You can't deal with it anymore because then--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's just it. If you don't even define the problem, you can't address the problem. If you don't see the problem and just call it like something else and equate the same rights and standards to people who shouldn't be here that you do the people who already are here, the people who already are here get a little annoyed and the people who want to legally get here and go through the process of becoming permanent citizens here - they get annoyed too.</p><p>WEST: Well, they get discouraged. I mean, look at what is happening as far as the release of those five senior members of the Taliban. Everyone is calling them \"prisoners of war\". That's not what they are. They are \"unlawful enemy combatants\" and they don't deserve any rights. And these non-state, non-uniform belligerents that are captured on this modern battlefield basically not represented or not recognized by the Geneva Convention, but yet, what do we continue to do just like this gentlemen Khatallah that we brought back from Libya, we get them constitutional rights, we get them lawyered up. So--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think we're way too politically correct (INAUDIBLE), not even your camp or Sarah Palin's camp that we should start filing impeachment charges against the president. I understand your frustration though. But I - what I'm saying is we are so super careful - go ahead.</p><p>WEST: My frustration - my frustration is very narrowly defined with the president because I see a national security threat and that's why I see high crimes and misdemeanors. When the President of the United States of America makes a unilateral decision to release five senior members of the enemy while the enemy is still engaged in combat operations against us, that's providing material, comfort, and aid to an enemy. That's aiding and abetting your enemy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, no, no. I see your point there. I'll respectfully disagree with you. I can do so because you're in remote. If we were here in person, you'd hit me so I feel safe in doing this right now. But Allen, I will say this and I've already pushed time here but I am overly concerned about this incredible political incorrect environment in which we live and now how the media's signing onto it with one of the biggest crisis we face - that is our problem at the border - because you have a complicit media saying, \"What problem at the border?\"</p><p>WEST: Yes. You're absolutely right and you have a Nancy Pelosi who says it's not a crisis, this is an opportunity. You have Valerie Jarrett who is changed the--</p><p>CAVUTO: An - exactly. That was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WEST: --changed the language. It is a \"humanitarian situation\", not a \"humanitarian crisis\". And you do have a complicit media that's going along with it and that affects your ability to be able to make proper decisions to rectify the situation. But Neil, in closing, remember this - we have a President that went around the Congress and he enacted by executive order an immigration policy which has now caused this problem down on our southern border.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I just heard the back and forth and he was blaming the Republicans but for now, Millard Fillmore hasn't been blamed by I'm sure given time, Fillmore and his shenanigans will come to light.</p><p>Allen West, it's always good having you. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>By the way, political correctness still stands for the \"calorically- challenged\" instead of \"fat\". That one I'll let stay.</p><p>Meanwhile, did you hear about this Google executive - big, big tech executive, gets killed by a prostitute - we are told - allegedly. They met, connected on a social media site. The guy who heads that site, after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEP. CHIEF STEVE CLARK, SANTA CRUZ POLICE: So callous that in gathering her things, she was literally stepping over the body and at one point, stepped over the body to grab a glass of wine and finish the glass of wine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. This is a murder that is now suddenly rocking the tech world. It's even on the mainstream papers.</p><p>To Fox Business reporter Jo Ling Kent on the details that are beginning to come out. What do we know about this?</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, Neil, we do know that this was a liaison that had perhaps happened several times. Allegedly, the woman involved injected heroin into a 51-year-old Google executive's body. He died. And like you just heard there, she had an extra sip of wine before she left. She stepped over the body. She closed the shades, closed the yacht, and left.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Now, that's the charge. Now, Forrest Hayes is a big Google exec, his yacht, married, so all the complications with that. They meet on a social site - we're going to get into that in a second. Was there any - was there any signs prior that either she had a record or he had reason to be concerned?</p><p>KENT: Well, reports say that she's had about 200 differently liaisons and looking at him, according to the Santa Cruz police, this was an extended type of affair. Now, what's interesting here is she's been charged-</p><p>CAVUTO: You say \"extended\". Had they had met prior to this instance?</p><p>KENT: Repeated - yes, repeated contacts. And this is coming from evidence off of the cell phone of Mr. Hayes. And she's been charged with four different counts. But you should know it's manslaughter, administering and transporting and possessing heroin, excuse me, prostitution, and destroying evidence. So this is a very serious case.</p><p>CAVUTO: So the charges that she shot the heroin into him, that she would not have known in that case - if this is true - that it would have killed him--.</p><p>KENT: Santa Cruz police are saying that he was welcoming the drug usage. So the issue though, of course, is that she's possessing illegal drugs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. And injects it into someone else, allegedly. He dies, now it's manslaughter. Now, it's a mess.</p><p>KENT: Right. And what's really a mess is taking a look at it from the bird's eye view of Silicon Valley. I reached out to Google. They say they have no comment other than their hearts go out to the family of Mr. Hayes. But overall, looking at the case, there is a lot of excess and a lot of wealth involved in Silicon Valley. This individual - Mr. Hayes - has worked at Sun. He also worked at a couple of other major tech companies. So-</p><p>CAVUTO: But those guys always tend to get a fair rap in the press. I mean, well, for Wall Street - but that's a Wall Street guy. Those guys - you expect bad behavior. That's the way these things tend to be treated.</p><p>KENT: It's true that Silicon Valley has a very different reputation especially among the wealthy. They're known to be more modest. Looking at some of their boards - the bulletin boards regarding his obituary, a lot of people really looked up to him. They said he was one of the best bosses they've ever had. He worked on Google Glass. He was clearly an innovator, an executive at Google who set a very high standard according to those who say they worked with him. So this is - it's a very tragic case overall. Very messy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Very messy, in an industry we don't see a lot of, at least some established press.</p><p>Jo Ling, thank you for breaking that down for us.</p><p>In the meantime, the website they allegedly met on, SeekingArrangement.com founder and CEO Brandon Wade joins me right now on the phone.</p><p>Brandon, do you screen those who use your site?</p><p>BRANDON WADE, SEEKINGARRANGEMENT.COM CEO (ON THE PHONE): There is some screening that happens, obviously. We look at every single profile of members when they submit a profile to make sure that they don't violate against our policy. We look at the pictures that they upload. And of course we rely on members reporting each other so there's some sort of a community self-policing that goes on. And it's important to note that the alleged, I guess, the female - her profile had never received a single report on the site.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not on the site but there were reports prior. But are you saying it's not your site's responsibility then to start putting that up there as well, or what?</p><p>WADE: Well, what I'm - what I'm saying is there has been no reports. That means no other members have actually reported on her account or her profile as having done something wrong. And her profile certainly looks normal, just like any other dating profile out there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you doing anything differently now, Brandon? That if all this turns out and that this woman is (INAUDIBLE) manslaughter and did inject this guy with heroin and he dies, are you going to change anything, anything more of a screening process? Is this just a glaring, tragic exception, what?</p><p>WADE: As it is, we already have background check as an option on our website. I'll let you know, neither of them have--</p><p>CAVUTO: But should it be an option? In other words, should it be an option? If there's the risk of something like this happening, should that now be a requirement?</p><p>WADE: Well, that's a tough thing because even if you make it a requirement, people will still meet no matter what. They'll meet at the bar. They'll meet anywhere. What we tell people to do is just be careful. I mean, this is case of recreational drug use gone wrong. Don't use drugs. I mean, that's the moral of the story here.</p><p>CAVUTO: There's always a risk at this sort of thing, to your point. I remember the Craigslist murders where this sort of thing that was happening. So it must be, I guess, user beware. But for those who hook up on sites such as yours, do you issue warnings? Is there something you say upfront that \"Be careful here. Know what you're getting into.\" What?</p><p>WADE: Absolutely. I mean, we tell people how to date safely. I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff. And - but this is - this is a really weird situation too. They have actually been seeing each other for a while. They have had several meetings. This is not a one-off-type relationship.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you worried though that through no fault of your own, Brandon, that people are going to hear about your site and say, \"Oh, that was the one with the crazy hook-up in which the top executive died and it's just too messy and let me go to some other site\"?</p><p>WADE: The funny thing you should ask that because yesterday, we had the record-breaking day in terms of the number of sign-ups. And today is looking (INAUDIBLE) yesterday.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>WADE: So I'm not really sure why. But every time there's a bad news, it seems to be good news for our website. It's really strange.</p><p>CAVUTO: In other words, it would be more guys than women, more women than guys, what?</p><p>WADE: Well, typically more women sign up than men. And of course, with this news going out there with - as breaking news, we are seeing way more men signing up in the last two days.</p><p>CAVUTO: Amazing. Brandon Wade. Thank you. Hope this all works out. It is sad. Hopefully, it's an exception, far from the rule. Brandon Wade.</p><p>All right. You probably heard this latest talk that Citigroup is close to settling a $7 billion fine with the United States government. In case you're counting, worth what - $30 billion in bank fines? I am far from a big supporter of banks and over that they are without sin. But is it me or do they keep coming up as the only sinner? Just weird. After this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Normally, we get a lot of comments over something I've said or discussed on this show or my Fox News show. But this concerns something I wrote for our Fox Business website about all these bank fines - the latest $7 billion likely slapped on Citigroup - likely double that for Bank of America for their respective parts in the meltdown you would think that only they had caused. So I started asking where is the punishment for the politicians - the ones who egged them on, pushing them to making more loans, turn home ownership from a goal to (INAUDIBLE) birthright.</p><p>Jane in Anthem, Arizona: \"Neil, I worked in the mortgage industry during the fiasco. Your accountability was the absolute best description I've read. The real truth is what the banks were encouraged and sometimes forced to do by our government has not widely been published. Thanks for you for this honest account.\"</p><p>J.A. in Carson City: \"Hey, you jerk! It's not just the banks that have paid a price for the - he said \"damn\", that's where I'm going to leave it - financial farce. My family will never recover from the lost value of our home. And the banks deserve to pay every dime of the punishment they get! Get your f*ing facts straight before you start preaching.\"</p><p>And J.A., banks are the only one responsible for what happened? No one else? Zero? Just them? Really? Who is the jerk, sir? Who is the one who has to get his facts straight before preaching?</p><p>Harry e-mails: \"Thanks, Neil. First article I've read in a long time placing the blame for the 2007-2008 financial breakdown where it belongs.\"</p><p>\"Some of your points like the Community Reinvestment Act are rarely mentioned anymore. Where do all the receipts the government has received in the form of penalties go? Does it go right back to the Treasury?\"</p><p>Well, pretty much, Rick. It does. It all goes back into the same big old pot and around and around she goes.</p><p>All right. To our Fox Biz All-Stars, Monica Mehta, Jonathan Hoenig, and Mattie Duppler.</p><p>Jonathan, what do you make of this?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: Oh, Neil, there's been a con job perpetrated on the American public over the last five or six years. And this idea that Wall Street caused the collapse, it was greedy profit- seeking financiers and unregulated speculators that caused the collapse. In fact, Obama made a video saying just that. In reality, all elements of the financial system that failed were regulated and the ones that failed the most were regulated the most. To allude to your (INAUDIBLE) too many of them - the Community Reinvestment Act. So the free markets don't fail but we didn't have a free market and that's what exactly what caused it to fail and will continue to cause failures in the years to come.</p><p>CAVUTO: And I've been around long enough and I'm covering all of this that I can distinctly remember Congresses and Presidents of both parties saying, \"You know you're not lending enough\", that we've got a housing boom here potentially right beneath us, \"Why don't you get with the program and start lending more? Loosen standards a little bit so we can get more people in on the fun.\" And this was the emergence of no doc loans where people with $50,000 incomes could buy million-dollar homes and better. They bear some responsibility. The politicians who egged this on bear some responsibility. Yet they're the ones who are handing out these punishments. Again, I am not saying that banks (INAUDIBLE) responsibility for securitizing a lot of the stuff, (INAUDIBLE), selling suspicious debt on maybe unbeknownst investors even though a lot of those investors knew exactly what they were buying. But I'm tired of the blame game and then only blaming them for it.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM DIRECTOR: Right. And I mean, the question you're asking is an important one. Who's regulating the regulators? And the answer is no one or they're regulating themselves. I mean, a lot of these guys over at the Consumer Protection Bureau - they have had all of their - all of the regulations essentially taken off of them with the advent of Dodd-Frank and now they're just - they're acting as regulators gone wild because they don't have rules that govern them (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, they left Fannie and Freddie out of this because of their political kinships and friendship. So that's sort of like leaving Charles Manson out of the discussion of the Sharon Tate murders.</p><p>But my only other issue, Monica, is look, right after the meltdown, immediately, Congress said, \"You lent too much. You were going crazy.\" A few months after the meltdown, they said, \"Why aren't you lending? You're drying up lending.\" I tell you, these banks can't win for love or money.</p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL MANAGING PRINCIPAL: Well, I think banks deserve the angst that they get. But to your point, which politicians are holding politicians accountable and which voters are holding politicians accountable? If you look at polls of how people feel about Congress--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I bet those politicians right now who are telling them \"Open up the spigot. You're being too tight in your lending standards.\" The same standards that they advocated for right after the meltdown.</p><p>MEHTA: Right. And then we're talking about how there isn't enough talk--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I want to see their photos in post offices around the country.</p><p>MEHTA: And aspects of Dodd-Frank have made it much harder for small businesses to actually get lending. There's all sorts of hypocrisy in all sides of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Because Washington's cures make the illness worse. That's where I come from (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HOENIG: And Neil, you saw the same thing we mentioned with Dodd-Frank a few times. Think back what a decades with Sarbanes-Oxley. That was past reaction to the last big financial crisis. Remember Enron and Adelphia - that caused a lot of small companies not to be able to go public because of the expense it will raise some more. So every time we get a crisis caused by government, controls breed more controls. You get more control. I think that's why despite all the regulation that was supposed to fix the financial crisis - to Monica's point - we haven't seen the lending pick up. We also haven't seen the job creation and employment pick up that's directly due to these controls in the financial sector.</p><p>CAVUTO: Bottom line, we're all human beings and we all make our own bed and we all are realistic enough when we sign on a loan. But we signed it. Nope, no one coerces it. I have yet to run into a McDonald's and the manager force feeds me a double Quarter Pounder. I did it myself!</p><p>Meanwhile, when we come back, a federal judge today looking for answers on the IRS and all this targeting Conservatives. But did we just find the one smoking gun? Via an e-mail that we thought was missing? After this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but we warned you about this judge who is now looking into the whole e-mail mess and the targeting conservatives at the IRS, but did he just find a smoking gun? A former IRS director admitting in e-mail, no less, that she warned employees about what they write in the e-mails. Even asking a tech employ at the IRS which messages and emails are traceable. Back with the all-stars, Monica, Jonathan, and Maddie. Mattie, this is your smoking gun.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM DIRECTOR: You would think so, right? You have someone warning her employees not to e-mail sensitive things in an e-mail. So that in and of itself demonstrates not only .</p><p>CAVUTO: That would be like me e-mailing my staff, could you kind of erase the e-mails like .</p><p>DUPPLER: Emails, right.</p><p>CAVUTO: They don't, they save them.</p><p>DUPPLER: So, I mean it's speculative just in the context of what she's saying but she also seemed to get it wrong. She was asking about whether or not the messages are available to Congress or they'll be deleted? That kind of thing. That shows that there was some kind of intent there, some kind of interest in keeping whatever it was she was IM'ing or e-mailing secret. So that raised the question right there. And the fact that we now have a judge who thinks that the American public deserves an answer for that, I think, is a very important step towards getting to the bottom of that.</p><p>CAVUTO: And this is the same judge who wanted the heads up on how did all these e-mails go disappearing and why didn't give us a heads-up earlier on how they all disappear. Practically wanting to subpoena the server they were on.</p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPAL: Look, highly unusual, I mean you don't have emails disappear from six different computers for six different users.</p><p>CAVUTO: Certainly, not at the IRS.</p><p>MEHTA: It is not uncommon to be a corporate policy that you should watch what you e-mail. I mean back when e-mail was young in the 1990s you could .</p><p>CAVUTO: This is about hiding it.</p><p>MEHTA: Right, but so it's all in the context. But if it is just watch what you e-mail, like that is common communication policy.</p><p>DUPPLER: But if she's a manager, why does she have to inquire about this at this point? What, five, ten years into her career. Shouldn't you already know this if you are in charge?</p><p>CAVUTO: Because going on to say, John, - but when you start mentioning things in e-mail and discerning what are traceable messages and e-mails, that gets into the icky category.</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, if it's purposely deceptive, Neil. If that was in a corporation, it would be totally unacceptable and potentially criminal. This isn't even a corporation. Those aren't a company's computers, those are the people's computers. And Lois Lerner is in a high-level executive at Cisco or Microsoft. She's literally a gun. That's what the IRS is. It's government force brought to individuals finances. So in the most transparent administration in history, it's more than a little bit suspect that six hard drives with the smoking gun as you point out at it, potentially the smoking gun, suddenly go missing.</p><p>CAVUTO: Suddenly go missing, that's right. That just doesn't make sense, you know? Normally all e-mails should disappear when that happens.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right. Maybe we should be combining the NSA and the IRS, maybe that's what the solution is here. The president is trying to expand what the kind of bureaucracy we already have.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you are going to hide stuff, guys, you got to hide everything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Just advise you. Criminal. Anyway, here's why the president is not going to the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: This isn't theater. This is a problem. I'm not interested in photo-ops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're not interested in photo-ops? Then I'm not interested in ponderosa buffets.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, one of my next guests buying a car sight unseen. I'm going to go ahead and buy this car, without seeing, it I have a good idea what it's like, and I'm going to put in my order and hopefully they'll deliver to my house. Would you do that? Maybe if it's really new cars. Maybe some of you would. But you certainly want to kick the tires or certainly read up on the car you're about to buy. But the president is doing the equivalent of that sight unseen, not going to the border and then, at the same time arguing for $3.7 billion to address this border mess and the processing for this better than 50,000 largely kids who just made their way here. All right. So do those two connect? Leaving aside the fact that the president argue that he didn't want to go to the border because he's not into photo-ops, which, of course, he is. All right. We have auto dealer Mark Calisi here and real estate expert Katrina Campins. As the auto guy, Mark, how many customers of yours do that?</p><p>MARK CALISI, AUTO DEALER: Zero.</p><p>CAVUTO: right?</p><p>CALISI: Zero. Imagine you come into my dealership to buy a car and I'm saying you, Neil, give me a check for$50,000 first, then I'll let you look at the car, then I'll tell you about the options, but not until you give me a check for 50,000, and I deposit it.</p><p>CAVUTO: You would scare me. So I would do that. Just to get of the showroom. But I mean. No, it just - Right? It defies credulity?</p><p>CALISI: It's not. It's outrageous that he's asking for $3.7 billion from the American taxpayers to handle these illegal, and I say illegal immigration crisis without having any type of a plan. And just we went into a bank and wanted to borrow $10,000.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it was like you were dealing when the auto bailouts and everything else - in the effect. He didn't reason out the fallout for good dealers who are having good sales and being forced to shut down or relocate, whatever, without thinking it through.</p><p>CALISI: A lot of people got hurt, a lot of families got hurt and the taxpayers are going to get hurt. Now the dealers suing the federal government and the federal government is ready to stop paying the dealers back.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, there is nothing of GM and the separate lawsuits. You're right. But Katrina, what I wonder about is, how this looks now, the president not going to the border. That's just once and all - the whole thing that he doesn't like photo-ops was a little strange to me. But what damage is done here and how - wouldn't it hurt his cause to get that 3.7 billion?</p><p>KATRINA CAMPINS, REAL ESTATE EXPERT: Well, from my industry's perspective, which is real estate, nobody purchases a home without sight unseen. The same thing with .</p><p>CAVUTO: No, they did during the boom. They did during the boom. They were buying condos, sight unseen.</p><p>CAMPINS: Preconstruction.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CAMPINS: But Neil, many of those people did come in to do the final walk through before they actually closed on the property. But those days are really no longer. Even in preconstruction projects right now, when people are seeing it sight unseen, they still are doing the walk through and they still are making sure that they feel the actual products, especially because there's more required down now. So, the days of only putting 5 percent down are over. As far as large - but in the luxury market, for instance, the $2 million, $3 million, $4 million homes. People want to see those homes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, what about the 3.7 billion dollar homes. How does that go? Well, a good point, guys. I mean I'm just saying that anything that costs a lot, I would like to check it out. And, you know, Mark, to your point, accountability means everything and accountability means visibility. It means seeing what you're getting into.</p><p>CALISI: I agree. Like I said to you before, I have never seen in all my years in business, someone just laying out a blank check and saying trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CALISI: Don't go there.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you worry with this border issue is what? That we can't trust whatever deal we get or it's going to get more expensive or it's going to be a waste, what?</p><p>CALISI: Since there isn't a plan, one it is going to become more expensive. Right now the only thing we're doing is housing the women, men and children coming over the border right now. We do not have a plan to move forward. We have a plan with Mexico because -- and Canada as a continuous - as a border state. But why don't we have that same plan with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala? Why don't we have it with them? And just put them right back to where they were. No, we have that due process. The American taxpayers are paying for this. The 3.7 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to what it really - is going to be down the road.</p><p>CAVUTO: And Katrina, if I could belabor, you are one of the best real estate people I know. But I do know a thing or two when you look to buy a home, a lot of your types, those who are very good at this, they'll dress it up. They'll make sure it's an inviting home. Sometimes you put vanilla candles or something like that where it makes it alluring. So that when you go in there, you know, I might go ahead and invest in this or look around in this. There's been none of that done with this deal, and I think what scares me is, we haven't even tried to make it an inviting deal. We've just got ahead and say, there, there's the price, pay it or else?</p><p>CAMPINS: Well, I think a lot of people are concerned with this particular bill, because given Obama's history with other bills, there has been an influx of money, but then there hasn't been a plan of action. It costs the taxpayers and then there's no execution plan. So I think that's the major concern. And that's a lot of money to simply allocate to this particular bill. So, but you're right, Neil. And you know, things need to be staged, you need to feel it. You need to have a plan of action before you invest a large sum of money</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely. I know when my kids are selling houses, my wife said we are going to have to take down the Velvet Elvis, just for the sale. Just so, you know. All right. Mark, Katrina, thank you both very, very much. We want to hear their perspectives. Because they know a thing or two about how that would fly in their industries. It wouldn't. All right, coming up: What if I told you someone is making double your salary without even having the job? I bet they're working right around you, right now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are looking at some sort of mental hunger games against a bunch of genius kids for just like a handful of jobs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are interns?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shut up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Deal with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's so old.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I should have told my daughter to be an intern, she should have aimed higher. News that Twitter interns, are you sitting down? Well, probably are, it's been a long show, if you were standing up, you'd be getting tired. Anyway, they make the equivalent of $81,000 a year. $81,000 a year. Back with our all-stars, Monica, Jonathan, Mattie. Jonathan, what do you think of that?</p><p>HOENIG: Tell me again about evil big business, you know, just exploiting, exploiting everybody. I mean companies are guilty regardless, right, if they don't pay their interns, they say they are exploiting, you know, underaged kids, if they do pay their interns, they are catching hell for that as well.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, that's a very good point. That's a very good - Is there happy medium though, can we not be at 80,000 plus, but I do hear your point.</p><p>HOENIG: Well, Neil, the money is wonderful, the real takeaway for these kids is the self-esteem and the skills they build through the work experience. This is why everyone who wants to raise the minimum wage doesn't get it. It's not the wage that really matters. It's the skills, it's the work experience, it's the work ethic, taking responsibility that's the biggest payoff from any internship or low level ..</p><p>CAVUTO: That's going to be ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Waiting for that intern.</p><p>DUPPLER: I'm going to make it a good - I'm going to leave here and go get an internship at Twitter after this. But I mean he's right. This is a good experience, this is a great .</p><p>CAVUTO: But is it making kids think that they don't get, that they have got a lousy internship, it's a waste of time.</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, perhaps if they can't get a job after. But that's the whole point of internships, right? They are supposed to be giving you this experience and the exposure that you can then use and take with you. It's not supposed to be handing you your next job, it's supposed to be something that does prepare you, but at the end of the day, you know, no matter if you are working for Twitter or working for McDonald's. If you're not the one who is going to hustle, no one is going to hire you.</p><p>CAVUTO: But we might build in an expectation here, that this is what will happen for interns now?</p><p>MEHTA: I don't see the downside of offering a rewarding position to people who want to work hard and have the skill set. And at the same token, young people have the highest level of unemployment. So, if we are going to kick them in the ass and say, hey, there are good opportunities.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, we don't use that kind of language.</p><p>MEHTA: I said arse .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Very good. But you know, I asked to do that.</p><p>You know, Johnny, I was thinking about this, and I could always remember as a kid, I would have a variety of internships, several, and I worked as a waiter at night. But I did eat the restaurant out of business, but my point was that you devalue the experience. What I'm worried with some kids, not all, because I think those kids are decent, hardworking, trying to get ahead just like we did when we were younger. But you might say, hey, Twitter is where I want to go, not because it's such a great company, not because it's such a great opportunity, but because you get this, and then you could have a short-lived expectation and the short-term view.</p><p>HOENIG: Well, Yeah, I mean, Neil, that's a good thing, it's good that these young people see that if they work hard, if they apply themselves, they can have tremendous .</p><p>CAVUTO: They .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: John, come on.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOENIG: They are working very hard, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Come up with 140 characters, I'm richer than God on 140 characters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MEHTA: #neilisawesome.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, #neilisawesome. Very good, you are back.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUPPLER: Neil, every time I come on the show, I have to defend my generation from the new disruptive technology that we're working for. But, you know, again, this is a great opportunity for someone to get involved in what is a new disruptive technology, Twitter. A couple - when I was graduating college, Twitter didn't even exist. So, who knows what the next thing is going to be.</p><p>CAVUTO: When I graduated from college, the Internet didn't exist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: It is a big difference, young lady. Don't rub it in my face.</p><p>DUPPLER: But isn't it great that we can both sit on the TV site and talk about it?</p><p>CAVUTO: no.</p><p>DUPPLER: I mean isn't it great, though? Look at how .</p><p>CAVUTO: Tweeting about it?</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, like I said.</p><p>MEHTA: They were talking about Pets.com being disruptive. We'll see what happens.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there, but historically, how are we going to look back at this, John?</p><p>HOENIG: Neil, people said this is the bubble. I don't think it's the bubble. Industries like Twitter and maybe Pets.com wasn't disrupted, but it born Amazon. It bore million other opportunities. So, I think Twitter is for real, I think a lot of the new technology is for real and these kids are blessed to be able to have that firsthand experience.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, these kids don't even appreciate how good you have it!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And what is the deal with all of these growing calls for President Obama's impeachment? Paul in Washington, \"Impeach Obama, but not yet. After Republicans got a majority in the Senate, then an impeachment would result in his removal from office. You need a lot of votes. Frank in Louisiana, \"Neil, you were just too damn pragmatic.\" And a realist who wants to get real stuff done. Bill in Florida, \"Neil, he's earned - by failing to enforcing laws, which is a violation of his oath, but nobody in Congress has the guts to go after the president.\" You know, it doesn't take guts to file briefs against the president. It takes guts to get stuff done so you can make well his argument. Lou Dwayne via Gmail, \"Sorry, Cavuto, just more smoke and hot air out of both ends of your anatomy. Blah-blah-talk talk.\" Dwayne, don't write.</p><p>Jacqueline via Yahoo! \"Yes, the GOP is doing the right thing. It's about time. Impeachment is a must to get our USA back from this tyrant.\" Stephanie in Tennessee, \"I was dismayed to hear Senator Coburn use the word ridiculous when you asked him about impeachment.\" Well, because he said there were better uses of Congress this time and I think he is right.</p><p>Jim in Washington, \"Congress is a bigger problem than our outlaw president, they enable him. Think about it. Then thousands of illegals at our border and thousands more being processed, all on our dime, Nora in Texas, \"That's enough. You mentioned that the 3.7 billion requested by the president for the border crisis is for processing 50,000 people. $74,000 to process each person? Seriously. So, exactly what sort of process is this? Not a good one, Nora. And clearly not a cheap one, either. Antonio in Florida, \"the abuse of citizens by the federal government has been increasingly bad and will get worse. When are you and others going to realize that we must split the country?\" What? By that reasoning, Antonio, Abraham Lincoln simply wasted his time trying to keep this country together and keep slavery a thing of the past.</p><p>The sum of our parts is far greater than any of our individual parts. I think we can work all this stuff out without throwing up our arms or just walking out. Then to my chat with Garry Johnson, of course, saying this for making legalizing pot a key part of his presidential campaign. Now he's involved with a business that does pretty much that. And explores marijuana's myriad of other virtue and uses. Kelly in New York City, \"Neil, as someone who suffers from MS, you should be for legalizing a substance that helps fellow sufferers deal with the pain.\" If it helps them with the pain, fine, I'm fine with that. John via AOL, \"Cavuto, did you see how Johnson's hair was all messed up? Classic druggy.\" No, John, messy hair doesn't mean you are high as a kite, it just means maybe you didn't stop by a mirror.\"</p><p>Allen via CVS, \"Cavuto, if you are not stoned out of your mind, then I frankly don't know what explains your spacy performance and clueless demeanor.\" Allen, that is me wrong. Tommy in North Carolina, \"I really enjoyed the Gary Johnson interview.\" I think you are the only anchor of Fox News, not just the Fox Business channel who has been fair to former governor. But you should have made clear that he hasn't done drugs or had a drink for that matter for decades.\" Well, it's very good to know, Tommy, although sometimes I wonder as I told the governor myself.</p><p>Crack-head writes, Jeez, I want to know this is going to be about, \"Dude, you were so high doing that interview admit it.\" Dude, I so was not. Who uses language like that? Cantor emails, \"Cavuto, the last thing a guy your size should be pushing for is legalizing marijuana. You, my friend, do not need munchies.\" And you, my friend, do need to write me. So stop. The rest of you, have a great night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And here's why the president believes it's no big deal not visiting the border. Who in the media is really going to call him on it? Think about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've looked into this, my friends, and here is what I discovered. This illegal immigration crisis, well, it's not even a crisis. It's not inhumane. The way we are treating these tens of thousands of illegals dumped on us is what's inhumane. Not illegal, inhumane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, to the mainstream media, it's not even about illegals at all. They won't even use the term \"illegal.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, more on that in a second. For now, I want you to concentrate on how they're covering this story - not what they are including, what they are omitting. It is the way they frame this argument. It is the way they discuss this issue by never using the word \"illegal.\"</p><p>Well, they rid themselves of the nuisance of having to explain all of these thousands of people who are breaking the law, our laws, our country. No, no. You see, they're not the problem. We are! And Republicans, well, they're even worse. They're not patriots, they're bigots. They're not against illegal immigration, now, they're just against all immigration. It's morphed into that.</p><p>Get ready for this, because what I'm about to show you proves it. These are unedited, undoctored, very real clips, headlines, stories from a sampling of news items on the ongoing illegal immigration mess that never use the word \"illegal\" once. Not once.</p><p>The Washington Post, June 30th: \"It's OK that Congress won't act on immigration.\"</p><p>The L.A. Times, July 5th: \"A mounting backlog of immigration courts...\"</p><p>BusinessWeek, this week: \"With immigration reform dead on Capitol Hill, President Obama says he will use his executive authority to make changes to the law himself.\"</p><p>NBC News' <person><nameText>Matt Lauer </nameText></person>urging viewers to share their thoughts on Twitter by calling these latest immigrants - not illegal immigrants - immigrants by #RefugeeRiders and they are never to be called \"illegal\" at all. NBC choosing instead the term \"undocumented\". Ditto CBS.</p><p>In fact, the L.A. Times and the Associated Press have announced a ban on the term \"illegal immigrants.\" They say it broadly and unfairly labels a large group of people.</p><p>Well, that makes things easy, doesn't it? Sort of like dispensing with the term \"global warming\" after a few harsh winters then ta da! It's climate change. Who can argue with that?</p><p>So now by saying we have an immigration crisis, you could say that anyone who's against these waves of illegals coming here are anti-immigrant or worse, anti- I don't know - human being. Suddenly, they're not for illegal immigration reform, they're against immigration reform. Immigration reform.</p><p>Leave out the illegal part and you might almost forget the billions we are spending on processing these tens of thousands of illegal kids dumped in this country into thinking that they are citizens of this country. They are not. And those opposed to keeping these noncitizens here are racist. They are not.</p><p>You see, when you leave out words you don't like, you can kind of say anything you do like. But let me tell you something. I can call myself \"calorically-challenged\" instead of \"fat\" to make myself feel good but that doesn't make me any less fat. So fat chance it'll make me anymore aware.</p><p>But those are my thoughts. I'd love to hear yours. Use #Cavuto and I'll share them with the world.</p><p>First to Accuracy in Media Editor, Roger Aronoff.</p><p>Roger, this started as a curious little project on my part - just seeing what I could get just hearing and reading media stories - and it's true. \"Illegal\" doesn't happen. It's a word you can't find. What happened?</p><p>ROGER ARONOFF, ACCURACY IN MEDIA EDITOR: Oh, you're exactly right, Neil. Great to be with you today and it was a great setup. Yes. For instance, the Associated Press took it out of their style book so that you can no longer say \"illegal aliens\" because it's too judgmental and it might hurt someone's feelings so they've just removed it from the lexicon. It's only used to describe actions and not people. And that just serves--.</p><p>CAVUTO: But they will freely write stories of - those critical of what we're doing right now at the border - they can still be called \"bigots\". They can still be called \"obstructionists\" or God knows what. But \"illegal\" somehow is now taken on a bad connotation and who are we afraid of offending again?</p><p>ARONOFF: Well, that's right. What's going on here, I believe, is that there's an agenda. They are pushing for this so-called comprehensive immigration reform also known as amnesty and they also want to protect President Obama. They have a lot invested in him. So this is what they're doing. I mean, we're looking at this 50,000 children that have come over but there's really even a much larger story. There was a piece in the New York Times last week and this is the New York Times that acknowledged that since April alone, there have been 240,000 adult migrants - they call them - that have come across as well and most of them are just released to go where they want to in the U.S.</p><p>CAVUTO: And back and forth and back and forth. The recidivism is beyond the pale. But here's what is amazing to me. When you ignore the obvious and you've written about this brilliantly, then you don't do what should be obvious. When you talk about the rights of illegals or illegals have to be given a license to drive and illegals - in some communities - they even have to be given the right to vote. In New York City, they're debating that as we speak and I'm thinking to myself, \"What part of `illegal' do they not understand?\" What part of `noncitizen' do they not understand? What part of stealing their way across the border for whatever reason do they not understand? And then I'm thinking of all the well-intended immigrants who are coming here and going through the process, who also write me and say, \"What the heck?\"</p><p>ARONOFF: You're absolutely right. I mean, this is the worst it's for the legal aliens - the people who do the right thing and get in line and come here - and this flood of illegal immigrants has created massive headaches for them and for many of us who are really very pro-immigrant but anti- illegal immigrant, it's - this is a disaster and it's really a manufactured crisis. You look back at a couple of things. Obama's trying to blame this back on this 2008 law that really, there was the 2012 DACA - Deferred Action for Childhood Admissions - and the other thing is that we know there was a contract put out in January of this year that specified 65,00 children coming here calling for escorts to bring them here. So they have known this exactly and this is really a manufactured crisis and now, even this week, we've seen this other kind of maneuver where first they put out that it was going to be 1.8 billion, and then all of a sudden, no, it's 3.7 billion. They've tried to find--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, it'll go steadily higher than that, Roger, But your points are all well taken as usual. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>Oh, by the way, I was thinking of Nancy Pelosi also changing the fact it's not a border issue, that this is an Americas issue - North America, Central America, South America. We're all one. Who knew? I had to go back and look at my (INAUDIBLE) now.</p><p>All right. To former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West who's seen and heard enough.</p><p>What do you think of this, Congressman? Illegal, no more, don't use it?</p><p>FMR. REP. ALLEN WEST, (R) FLORIDA: Well, Neil, you hit the nail on the head when you start looking at how liberal progressives changed the lexicon. They are not \"illegal immigrants\". They're \"undocumented workers.\" You don't have \"drug dealers\", you have \"unlicensed pharmacists\". You don't even have \"combat operations\", you have \"overseas contingency operations.\" You have \"man-caused disasters\" instead of \"terrorist attacks\". And in recently, just out in California, we don't have \"husband and wife\" anymore, we have \"spouse one and spouse two\".</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>WEST: So you're right. As you change the language, then you make the thing that is obvious and the problem that should be dealt with completely un-dealable. You can't deal with it anymore because then--.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's just it. If you don't even define the problem, you can't address the problem. If you don't see the problem and just call it like something else and equate the same rights and standards to people who shouldn't be here that you do the people who already are here, the people who already are here get a little annoyed and the people who want to legally get here and go through the process of becoming permanent citizens here - they get annoyed too.</p><p>WEST: Well, they get discouraged. I mean, look at what is happening as far as the release of those five senior members of the Taliban. Everyone is calling them \"prisoners of war\". That's not what they are. They are \"unlawful enemy combatants\" and they don't deserve any rights. And these non-state, non-uniform belligerents that are captured on this modern battlefield basically not represented or not recognized by the Geneva Convention, but yet, what do we continue to do just like this gentlemen Khatallah that we brought back from Libya, we get them constitutional rights, we get them lawyered up. So--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I think we're way too politically correct (INAUDIBLE), not even your camp or Sarah Palin's camp that we should start filing impeachment charges against the president. I understand your frustration though. But I - what I'm saying is we are so super careful - go ahead.</p><p>WEST: My frustration - my frustration is very narrowly defined with the president because I see a national security threat and that's why I see high crimes and misdemeanors. When the President of the United States of America makes a unilateral decision to release five senior members of the enemy while the enemy is still engaged in combat operations against us, that's providing material, comfort, and aid to an enemy. That's aiding and abetting your enemy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, no, no. I see your point there. I'll respectfully disagree with you. I can do so because you're in remote. If we were here in person, you'd hit me so I feel safe in doing this right now. But Allen, I will say this and I've already pushed time here but I am overly concerned about this incredible political incorrect environment in which we live and now how the media's signing onto it with one of the biggest crisis we face - that is our problem at the border - because you have a complicit media saying, \"What problem at the border?\"</p><p>WEST: Yes. You're absolutely right and you have a Nancy Pelosi who says it's not a crisis, this is an opportunity. You have Valerie Jarrett who is changed the--</p><p>CAVUTO: An - exactly. That was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WEST: --changed the language. It is a \"humanitarian situation\", not a \"humanitarian crisis\". And you do have a complicit media that's going along with it and that affects your ability to be able to make proper decisions to rectify the situation. But Neil, in closing, remember this - we have a President that went around the Congress and he enacted by executive order an immigration policy which has now caused this problem down on our southern border.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I just heard the back and forth and he was blaming the Republicans but for now, Millard Fillmore hasn't been blamed by I'm sure given time, Fillmore and his shenanigans will come to light.</p><p>Allen West, it's always good having you. Thank you very, very much.</p><p>By the way, political correctness still stands for the \"calorically- challenged\" instead of \"fat\". That one I'll let stay.</p><p>Meanwhile, did you hear about this Google executive - big, big tech executive, gets killed by a prostitute - we are told - allegedly. They met, connected on a social media site. The guy who heads that site, after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEP. CHIEF STEVE CLARK, SANTA CRUZ POLICE: So callous that in gathering her things, she was literally stepping over the body and at one point, stepped over the body to grab a glass of wine and finish the glass of wine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. This is a murder that is now suddenly rocking the tech world. It's even on the mainstream papers.</p><p>To Fox Business reporter Jo Ling Kent on the details that are beginning to come out. What do we know about this?</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, Neil, we do know that this was a liaison that had perhaps happened several times. Allegedly, the woman involved injected heroin into a 51-year-old Google executive's body. He died. And like you just heard there, she had an extra sip of wine before she left. She stepped over the body. She closed the shades, closed the yacht, and left.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Now, that's the charge. Now, Forrest Hayes is a big Google exec, his yacht, married, so all the complications with that. They meet on a social site - we're going to get into that in a second. Was there any - was there any signs prior that either she had a record or he had reason to be concerned?</p><p>KENT: Well, reports say that she's had about 200 differently liaisons and looking at him, according to the Santa Cruz police, this was an extended type of affair. Now, what's interesting here is she's been charged-</p><p>CAVUTO: You say \"extended\". Had they had met prior to this instance?</p><p>KENT: Repeated - yes, repeated contacts. And this is coming from evidence off of the cell phone of Mr. Hayes. And she's been charged with four different counts. But you should know it's manslaughter, administering and transporting and possessing heroin, excuse me, prostitution, and destroying evidence. So this is a very serious case.</p><p>CAVUTO: So the charges that she shot the heroin into him, that she would not have known in that case - if this is true - that it would have killed him--.</p><p>KENT: Santa Cruz police are saying that he was welcoming the drug usage. So the issue though, of course, is that she's possessing illegal drugs.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. And injects it into someone else, allegedly. He dies, now it's manslaughter. Now, it's a mess.</p><p>KENT: Right. And what's really a mess is taking a look at it from the bird's eye view of Silicon Valley. I reached out to Google. They say they have no comment other than their hearts go out to the family of Mr. Hayes. But overall, looking at the case, there is a lot of excess and a lot of wealth involved in Silicon Valley. This individual - Mr. Hayes - has worked at Sun. He also worked at a couple of other major tech companies. So-</p><p>CAVUTO: But those guys always tend to get a fair rap in the press. I mean, well, for Wall Street - but that's a Wall Street guy. Those guys - you expect bad behavior. That's the way these things tend to be treated.</p><p>KENT: It's true that Silicon Valley has a very different reputation especially among the wealthy. They're known to be more modest. Looking at some of their boards - the bulletin boards regarding his obituary, a lot of people really looked up to him. They said he was one of the best bosses they've ever had. He worked on Google Glass. He was clearly an innovator, an executive at Google who set a very high standard according to those who say they worked with him. So this is - it's a very tragic case overall. Very messy.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Very messy, in an industry we don't see a lot of, at least some established press.</p><p>Jo Ling, thank you for breaking that down for us.</p><p>In the meantime, the website they allegedly met on, SeekingArrangement.com founder and CEO Brandon Wade joins me right now on the phone.</p><p>Brandon, do you screen those who use your site?</p><p>BRANDON WADE, SEEKINGARRANGEMENT.COM CEO (ON THE PHONE): There is some screening that happens, obviously. We look at every single profile of members when they submit a profile to make sure that they don't violate against our policy. We look at the pictures that they upload. And of course we rely on members reporting each other so there's some sort of a community self-policing that goes on. And it's important to note that the alleged, I guess, the female - her profile had never received a single report on the site.</p><p>CAVUTO: Not on the site but there were reports prior. But are you saying it's not your site's responsibility then to start putting that up there as well, or what?</p><p>WADE: Well, what I'm - what I'm saying is there has been no reports. That means no other members have actually reported on her account or her profile as having done something wrong. And her profile certainly looks normal, just like any other dating profile out there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you doing anything differently now, Brandon? That if all this turns out and that this woman is (INAUDIBLE) manslaughter and did inject this guy with heroin and he dies, are you going to change anything, anything more of a screening process? Is this just a glaring, tragic exception, what?</p><p>WADE: As it is, we already have background check as an option on our website. I'll let you know, neither of them have--</p><p>CAVUTO: But should it be an option? In other words, should it be an option? If there's the risk of something like this happening, should that now be a requirement?</p><p>WADE: Well, that's a tough thing because even if you make it a requirement, people will still meet no matter what. They'll meet at the bar. They'll meet anywhere. What we tell people to do is just be careful. I mean, this is case of recreational drug use gone wrong. Don't use drugs. I mean, that's the moral of the story here.</p><p>CAVUTO: There's always a risk at this sort of thing, to your point. I remember the Craigslist murders where this sort of thing that was happening. So it must be, I guess, user beware. But for those who hook up on sites such as yours, do you issue warnings? Is there something you say upfront that \"Be careful here. Know what you're getting into.\" What?</p><p>WADE: Absolutely. I mean, we tell people how to date safely. I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff. And - but this is - this is a really weird situation too. They have actually been seeing each other for a while. They have had several meetings. This is not a one-off-type relationship.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you worried though that through no fault of your own, Brandon, that people are going to hear about your site and say, \"Oh, that was the one with the crazy hook-up in which the top executive died and it's just too messy and let me go to some other site\"?</p><p>WADE: The funny thing you should ask that because yesterday, we had the record-breaking day in terms of the number of sign-ups. And today is looking (INAUDIBLE) yesterday.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>WADE: So I'm not really sure why. But every time there's a bad news, it seems to be good news for our website. It's really strange.</p><p>CAVUTO: In other words, it would be more guys than women, more women than guys, what?</p><p>WADE: Well, typically more women sign up than men. And of course, with this news going out there with - as breaking news, we are seeing way more men signing up in the last two days.</p><p>CAVUTO: Amazing. Brandon Wade. Thank you. Hope this all works out. It is sad. Hopefully, it's an exception, far from the rule. Brandon Wade.</p><p>All right. You probably heard this latest talk that Citigroup is close to settling a $7 billion fine with the United States government. In case you're counting, worth what - $30 billion in bank fines? I am far from a big supporter of banks and over that they are without sin. But is it me or do they keep coming up as the only sinner? Just weird. After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Normally, we get a lot of comments over something I've said or discussed on this show or my Fox News show. But this concerns something I wrote for our Fox Business website about all these bank fines - the latest $7 billion likely slapped on Citigroup - likely double that for Bank of America for their respective parts in the meltdown you would think that only they had caused. So I started asking where is the punishment for the politicians - the ones who egged them on, pushing them to making more loans, turn home ownership from a goal to (INAUDIBLE) birthright.</p><p>Jane in Anthem, Arizona: \"Neil, I worked in the mortgage industry during the fiasco. Your accountability was the absolute best description I've read. The real truth is what the banks were encouraged and sometimes forced to do by our government has not widely been published. Thanks for you for this honest account.\"</p><p>J.A. in Carson City: \"Hey, you jerk! It's not just the banks that have paid a price for the - he said \"damn\", that's where I'm going to leave it - financial farce. My family will never recover from the lost value of our home. And the banks deserve to pay every dime of the punishment they get! Get your f*ing facts straight before you start preaching.\"</p><p>And J.A., banks are the only one responsible for what happened? No one else? Zero? Just them? Really? Who is the jerk, sir? Who is the one who has to get his facts straight before preaching?</p><p>Harry e-mails: \"Thanks, Neil. First article I've read in a long time placing the blame for the 2007-2008 financial breakdown where it belongs.\"</p><p>\"Some of your points like the Community Reinvestment Act are rarely mentioned anymore. Where do all the receipts the government has received in the form of penalties go? Does it go right back to the Treasury?\"</p><p>Well, pretty much, Rick. It does. It all goes back into the same big old pot and around and around she goes.</p><p>All right. To our Fox Biz All-Stars, Monica Mehta, Jonathan Hoenig, and Mattie Duppler.</p><p>Jonathan, what do you make of this?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: Oh, Neil, there's been a con job perpetrated on the American public over the last five or six years. And this idea that Wall Street caused the collapse, it was greedy profit- seeking financiers and unregulated speculators that caused the collapse. In fact, Obama made a video saying just that. In reality, all elements of the financial system that failed were regulated and the ones that failed the most were regulated the most. To allude to your (INAUDIBLE) too many of them - the Community Reinvestment Act. So the free markets don't fail but we didn't have a free market and that's what exactly what caused it to fail and will continue to cause failures in the years to come.</p><p>CAVUTO: And I've been around long enough and I'm covering all of this that I can distinctly remember Congresses and Presidents of both parties saying, \"You know you're not lending enough\", that we've got a housing boom here potentially right beneath us, \"Why don't you get with the program and start lending more? Loosen standards a little bit so we can get more people in on the fun.\" And this was the emergence of no doc loans where people with $50,000 incomes could buy million-dollar homes and better. They bear some responsibility. The politicians who egged this on bear some responsibility. Yet they're the ones who are handing out these punishments. Again, I am not saying that banks (INAUDIBLE) responsibility for securitizing a lot of the stuff, (INAUDIBLE), selling suspicious debt on maybe unbeknownst investors even though a lot of those investors knew exactly what they were buying. But I'm tired of the blame game and then only blaming them for it.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM DIRECTOR: Right. And I mean, the question you're asking is an important one. Who's regulating the regulators? And the answer is no one or they're regulating themselves. I mean, a lot of these guys over at the Consumer Protection Bureau - they have had all of their - all of the regulations essentially taken off of them with the advent of Dodd-Frank and now they're just - they're acting as regulators gone wild because they don't have rules that govern them (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, they left Fannie and Freddie out of this because of their political kinships and friendship. So that's sort of like leaving Charles Manson out of the discussion of the Sharon Tate murders.</p><p>But my only other issue, Monica, is look, right after the meltdown, immediately, Congress said, \"You lent too much. You were going crazy.\" A few months after the meltdown, they said, \"Why aren't you lending? You're drying up lending.\" I tell you, these banks can't win for love or money.</p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL MANAGING PRINCIPAL: Well, I think banks deserve the angst that they get. But to your point, which politicians are holding politicians accountable and which voters are holding politicians accountable? If you look at polls of how people feel about Congress--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I bet those politicians right now who are telling them \"Open up the spigot. You're being too tight in your lending standards.\" The same standards that they advocated for right after the meltdown.</p><p>MEHTA: Right. And then we're talking about how there isn't enough talk--.</p><p>CAVUTO: I want to see their photos in post offices around the country.</p><p>MEHTA: And aspects of Dodd-Frank have made it much harder for small businesses to actually get lending. There's all sorts of hypocrisy in all sides of it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Because Washington's cures make the illness worse. That's where I come from (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HOENIG: And Neil, you saw the same thing we mentioned with Dodd-Frank a few times. Think back what a decades with Sarbanes-Oxley. That was past reaction to the last big financial crisis. Remember Enron and Adelphia - that caused a lot of small companies not to be able to go public because of the expense it will raise some more. So every time we get a crisis caused by government, controls breed more controls. You get more control. I think that's why despite all the regulation that was supposed to fix the financial crisis - to Monica's point - we haven't seen the lending pick up. We also haven't seen the job creation and employment pick up that's directly due to these controls in the financial sector.</p><p>CAVUTO: Bottom line, we're all human beings and we all make our own bed and we all are realistic enough when we sign on a loan. But we signed it. Nope, no one coerces it. I have yet to run into a McDonald's and the manager force feeds me a double Quarter Pounder. I did it myself!</p><p>Meanwhile, when we come back, a federal judge today looking for answers on the IRS and all this targeting Conservatives. But did we just find the one smoking gun? Via an e-mail that we thought was missing? After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but we warned you about this judge who is now looking into the whole e-mail mess and the targeting conservatives at the IRS, but did he just find a smoking gun? A former IRS director admitting in e-mail, no less, that she warned employees about what they write in the e-mails. Even asking a tech employ at the IRS which messages and emails are traceable. Back with the all-stars, Monica, Jonathan, and Maddie. Mattie, this is your smoking gun.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM DIRECTOR: You would think so, right? You have someone warning her employees not to e-mail sensitive things in an e-mail. So that in and of itself demonstrates not only .</p><p>CAVUTO: That would be like me e-mailing my staff, could you kind of erase the e-mails like .</p><p>DUPPLER: Emails, right.</p><p>CAVUTO: They don't, they save them.</p><p>DUPPLER: So, I mean it's speculative just in the context of what she's saying but she also seemed to get it wrong. She was asking about whether or not the messages are available to Congress or they'll be deleted? That kind of thing. That shows that there was some kind of intent there, some kind of interest in keeping whatever it was she was IM'ing or e-mailing secret. So that raised the question right there. And the fact that we now have a judge who thinks that the American public deserves an answer for that, I think, is a very important step towards getting to the bottom of that.</p><p>CAVUTO: And this is the same judge who wanted the heads up on how did all these e-mails go disappearing and why didn't give us a heads-up earlier on how they all disappear. Practically wanting to subpoena the server they were on.</p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPAL: Look, highly unusual, I mean you don't have emails disappear from six different computers for six different users.</p><p>CAVUTO: Certainly, not at the IRS.</p><p>MEHTA: It is not uncommon to be a corporate policy that you should watch what you e-mail. I mean back when e-mail was young in the 1990s you could .</p><p>CAVUTO: This is about hiding it.</p><p>MEHTA: Right, but so it's all in the context. But if it is just watch what you e-mail, like that is common communication policy.</p><p>DUPPLER: But if she's a manager, why does she have to inquire about this at this point? What, five, ten years into her career. Shouldn't you already know this if you are in charge?</p><p>CAVUTO: Because going on to say, John, - but when you start mentioning things in e-mail and discerning what are traceable messages and e-mails, that gets into the icky category.</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, if it's purposely deceptive, Neil. If that was in a corporation, it would be totally unacceptable and potentially criminal. This isn't even a corporation. Those aren't a company's computers, those are the people's computers. And Lois Lerner is in a high-level executive at Cisco or Microsoft. She's literally a gun. That's what the IRS is. It's government force brought to individuals finances. So in the most transparent administration in history, it's more than a little bit suspect that six hard drives with the smoking gun as you point out at it, potentially the smoking gun, suddenly go missing.</p><p>CAVUTO: Suddenly go missing, that's right. That just doesn't make sense, you know? Normally all e-mails should disappear when that happens.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right. Maybe we should be combining the NSA and the IRS, maybe that's what the solution is here. The president is trying to expand what the kind of bureaucracy we already have.</p><p>CAVUTO: If you are going to hide stuff, guys, you got to hide everything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Just advise you. Criminal. Anyway, here's why the president is not going to the border.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: This isn't theater. This is a problem. I'm not interested in photo-ops.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: You're not interested in photo-ops? Then I'm not interested in ponderosa buffets.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, one of my next guests buying a car sight unseen. I'm going to go ahead and buy this car, without seeing, it I have a good idea what it's like, and I'm going to put in my order and hopefully they'll deliver to my house. Would you do that? Maybe if it's really new cars. Maybe some of you would. But you certainly want to kick the tires or certainly read up on the car you're about to buy. But the president is doing the equivalent of that sight unseen, not going to the border and then, at the same time arguing for $3.7 billion to address this border mess and the processing for this better than 50,000 largely kids who just made their way here. All right. So do those two connect? Leaving aside the fact that the president argue that he didn't want to go to the border because he's not into photo-ops, which, of course, he is. All right. We have auto dealer Mark Calisi here and real estate expert Katrina Campins. As the auto guy, Mark, how many customers of yours do that?</p><p>MARK CALISI, AUTO DEALER: Zero.</p><p>CAVUTO: right?</p><p>CALISI: Zero. Imagine you come into my dealership to buy a car and I'm saying you, Neil, give me a check for$50,000 first, then I'll let you look at the car, then I'll tell you about the options, but not until you give me a check for 50,000, and I deposit it.</p><p>CAVUTO: You would scare me. So I would do that. Just to get of the showroom. But I mean. No, it just - Right? It defies credulity?</p><p>CALISI: It's not. It's outrageous that he's asking for $3.7 billion from the American taxpayers to handle these illegal, and I say illegal immigration crisis without having any type of a plan. And just we went into a bank and wanted to borrow $10,000.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it was like you were dealing when the auto bailouts and everything else - in the effect. He didn't reason out the fallout for good dealers who are having good sales and being forced to shut down or relocate, whatever, without thinking it through.</p><p>CALISI: A lot of people got hurt, a lot of families got hurt and the taxpayers are going to get hurt. Now the dealers suing the federal government and the federal government is ready to stop paying the dealers back.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, there is nothing of GM and the separate lawsuits. You're right. But Katrina, what I wonder about is, how this looks now, the president not going to the border. That's just once and all - the whole thing that he doesn't like photo-ops was a little strange to me. But what damage is done here and how - wouldn't it hurt his cause to get that 3.7 billion?</p><p>KATRINA CAMPINS, REAL ESTATE EXPERT: Well, from my industry's perspective, which is real estate, nobody purchases a home without sight unseen. The same thing with .</p><p>CAVUTO: No, they did during the boom. They did during the boom. They were buying condos, sight unseen.</p><p>CAMPINS: Preconstruction.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>CAMPINS: But Neil, many of those people did come in to do the final walk through before they actually closed on the property. But those days are really no longer. Even in preconstruction projects right now, when people are seeing it sight unseen, they still are doing the walk through and they still are making sure that they feel the actual products, especially because there's more required down now. So, the days of only putting 5 percent down are over. As far as large - but in the luxury market, for instance, the $2 million, $3 million, $4 million homes. People want to see those homes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, what about the 3.7 billion dollar homes. How does that go? Well, a good point, guys. I mean I'm just saying that anything that costs a lot, I would like to check it out. And, you know, Mark, to your point, accountability means everything and accountability means visibility. It means seeing what you're getting into.</p><p>CALISI: I agree. Like I said to you before, I have never seen in all my years in business, someone just laying out a blank check and saying trust me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CALISI: Don't go there.</p><p>CAVUTO: So you worry with this border issue is what? That we can't trust whatever deal we get or it's going to get more expensive or it's going to be a waste, what?</p><p>CALISI: Since there isn't a plan, one it is going to become more expensive. Right now the only thing we're doing is housing the women, men and children coming over the border right now. We do not have a plan to move forward. We have a plan with Mexico because -- and Canada as a continuous - as a border state. But why don't we have that same plan with Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala? Why don't we have it with them? And just put them right back to where they were. No, we have that due process. The American taxpayers are paying for this. The 3.7 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to what it really - is going to be down the road.</p><p>CAVUTO: And Katrina, if I could belabor, you are one of the best real estate people I know. But I do know a thing or two when you look to buy a home, a lot of your types, those who are very good at this, they'll dress it up. They'll make sure it's an inviting home. Sometimes you put vanilla candles or something like that where it makes it alluring. So that when you go in there, you know, I might go ahead and invest in this or look around in this. There's been none of that done with this deal, and I think what scares me is, we haven't even tried to make it an inviting deal. We've just got ahead and say, there, there's the price, pay it or else?</p><p>CAMPINS: Well, I think a lot of people are concerned with this particular bill, because given Obama's history with other bills, there has been an influx of money, but then there hasn't been a plan of action. It costs the taxpayers and then there's no execution plan. So I think that's the major concern. And that's a lot of money to simply allocate to this particular bill. So, but you're right, Neil. And you know, things need to be staged, you need to feel it. You need to have a plan of action before you invest a large sum of money</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely. I know when my kids are selling houses, my wife said we are going to have to take down the Velvet Elvis, just for the sale. Just so, you know. All right. Mark, Katrina, thank you both very, very much. We want to hear their perspectives. Because they know a thing or two about how that would fly in their industries. It wouldn't. All right, coming up: What if I told you someone is making double your salary without even having the job? I bet they're working right around you, right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are looking at some sort of mental hunger games against a bunch of genius kids for just like a handful of jobs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are interns?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shut up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Deal with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's so old.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I should have told my daughter to be an intern, she should have aimed higher. News that Twitter interns, are you sitting down? Well, probably are, it's been a long show, if you were standing up, you'd be getting tired. Anyway, they make the equivalent of $81,000 a year. $81,000 a year. Back with our all-stars, Monica, Jonathan, Mattie. Jonathan, what do you think of that?</p><p>HOENIG: Tell me again about evil big business, you know, just exploiting, exploiting everybody. I mean companies are guilty regardless, right, if they don't pay their interns, they say they are exploiting, you know, underaged kids, if they do pay their interns, they are catching hell for that as well.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, that's a very good point. That's a very good - Is there happy medium though, can we not be at 80,000 plus, but I do hear your point.</p><p>HOENIG: Well, Neil, the money is wonderful, the real takeaway for these kids is the self-esteem and the skills they build through the work experience. This is why everyone who wants to raise the minimum wage doesn't get it. It's not the wage that really matters. It's the skills, it's the work experience, it's the work ethic, taking responsibility that's the biggest payoff from any internship or low level ..</p><p>CAVUTO: That's going to be ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Waiting for that intern.</p><p>DUPPLER: I'm going to make it a good - I'm going to leave here and go get an internship at Twitter after this. But I mean he's right. This is a good experience, this is a great .</p><p>CAVUTO: But is it making kids think that they don't get, that they have got a lousy internship, it's a waste of time.</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, perhaps if they can't get a job after. But that's the whole point of internships, right? They are supposed to be giving you this experience and the exposure that you can then use and take with you. It's not supposed to be handing you your next job, it's supposed to be something that does prepare you, but at the end of the day, you know, no matter if you are working for Twitter or working for McDonald's. If you're not the one who is going to hustle, no one is going to hire you.</p><p>CAVUTO: But we might build in an expectation here, that this is what will happen for interns now?</p><p>MEHTA: I don't see the downside of offering a rewarding position to people who want to work hard and have the skill set. And at the same token, young people have the highest level of unemployment. So, if we are going to kick them in the ass and say, hey, there are good opportunities.</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, we don't use that kind of language.</p><p>MEHTA: I said arse .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Very good. But you know, I asked to do that.</p><p>You know, Johnny, I was thinking about this, and I could always remember as a kid, I would have a variety of internships, several, and I worked as a waiter at night. But I did eat the restaurant out of business, but my point was that you devalue the experience. What I'm worried with some kids, not all, because I think those kids are decent, hardworking, trying to get ahead just like we did when we were younger. But you might say, hey, Twitter is where I want to go, not because it's such a great company, not because it's such a great opportunity, but because you get this, and then you could have a short-lived expectation and the short-term view.</p><p>HOENIG: Well, Yeah, I mean, Neil, that's a good thing, it's good that these young people see that if they work hard, if they apply themselves, they can have tremendous .</p><p>CAVUTO: They .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: John, come on.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOENIG: They are working very hard, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Come up with 140 characters, I'm richer than God on 140 characters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MEHTA: #neilisawesome.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yeah, #neilisawesome. Very good, you are back.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUPPLER: Neil, every time I come on the show, I have to defend my generation from the new disruptive technology that we're working for. But, you know, again, this is a great opportunity for someone to get involved in what is a new disruptive technology, Twitter. A couple - when I was graduating college, Twitter didn't even exist. So, who knows what the next thing is going to be.</p><p>CAVUTO: When I graduated from college, the Internet didn't exist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: It is a big difference, young lady. Don't rub it in my face.</p><p>DUPPLER: But isn't it great that we can both sit on the TV site and talk about it?</p><p>CAVUTO: no.</p><p>DUPPLER: I mean isn't it great, though? Look at how .</p><p>CAVUTO: Tweeting about it?</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, like I said.</p><p>MEHTA: They were talking about Pets.com being disruptive. We'll see what happens.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there, but historically, how are we going to look back at this, John?</p><p>HOENIG: Neil, people said this is the bubble. I don't think it's the bubble. Industries like Twitter and maybe Pets.com wasn't disrupted, but it born Amazon. It bore million other opportunities. So, I think Twitter is for real, I think a lot of the new technology is for real and these kids are blessed to be able to have that firsthand experience.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, these kids don't even appreciate how good you have it!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: And what is the deal with all of these growing calls for President Obama's impeachment? Paul in Washington, \"Impeach Obama, but not yet. After Republicans got a majority in the Senate, then an impeachment would result in his removal from office. You need a lot of votes. Frank in Louisiana, \"Neil, you were just too damn pragmatic.\" And a realist who wants to get real stuff done. Bill in Florida, \"Neil, he's earned - by failing to enforcing laws, which is a violation of his oath, but nobody in Congress has the guts to go after the president.\" You know, it doesn't take guts to file briefs against the president. It takes guts to get stuff done so you can make well his argument. Lou Dwayne via Gmail, \"Sorry, Cavuto, just more smoke and hot air out of both ends of your anatomy. Blah-blah-talk talk.\" Dwayne, don't write.</p><p>Jacqueline via Yahoo! \"Yes, the GOP is doing the right thing. It's about time. Impeachment is a must to get our USA back from this tyrant.\" Stephanie in Tennessee, \"I was dismayed to hear Senator Coburn use the word ridiculous when you asked him about impeachment.\" Well, because he said there were better uses of Congress this time and I think he is right.</p><p>Jim in Washington, \"Congress is a bigger problem than our outlaw president, they enable him. Think about it. Then thousands of illegals at our border and thousands more being processed, all on our dime, Nora in Texas, \"That's enough. You mentioned that the 3.7 billion requested by the president for the border crisis is for processing 50,000 people. $74,000 to process each person? Seriously. So, exactly what sort of process is this? Not a good one, Nora. And clearly not a cheap one, either. Antonio in Florida, \"the abuse of citizens by the federal government has been increasingly bad and will get worse. When are you and others going to realize that we must split the country?\" What? By that reasoning, Antonio, Abraham Lincoln simply wasted his time trying to keep this country together and keep slavery a thing of the past.</p><p>The sum of our parts is far greater than any of our individual parts. I think we can work all this stuff out without throwing up our arms or just walking out. Then to my chat with Garry Johnson, of course, saying this for making legalizing pot a key part of his presidential campaign. Now he's involved with a business that does pretty much that. And explores marijuana's myriad of other virtue and uses. Kelly in New York City, \"Neil, as someone who suffers from MS, you should be for legalizing a substance that helps fellow sufferers deal with the pain.\" If it helps them with the pain, fine, I'm fine with that. John via AOL, \"Cavuto, did you see how Johnson's hair was all messed up? Classic druggy.\" No, John, messy hair doesn't mean you are high as a kite, it just means maybe you didn't stop by a mirror.\"</p><p>Allen via CVS, \"Cavuto, if you are not stoned out of your mind, then I frankly don't know what explains your spacy performance and clueless demeanor.\" Allen, that is me wrong. Tommy in North Carolina, \"I really enjoyed the Gary Johnson interview.\" I think you are the only anchor of Fox News, not just the Fox Business channel who has been fair to former governor. But you should have made clear that he hasn't done drugs or had a drink for that matter for decades.\" Well, it's very good to know, Tommy, although sometimes I wonder as I told the governor myself.</p><p>Crack-head writes, Jeez, I want to know this is going to be about, \"Dude, you were so high doing that interview admit it.\" Dude, I so was not. Who uses language like that? Cantor emails, \"Cavuto, the last thing a guy your size should be pushing for is legalizing marijuana. You, my friend, do not need munchies.\" And you, my friend, do need to write me. So stop. The rest of you, have a great night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2014071001cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CMT-13S1-JB20-G505-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7622\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>July 10, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GHC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000884</classCode><className>ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000887</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DKU8</classCode><className>MIGRATION ISSUES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>PE000A5DL</classCode><className>NEIL CAVUTO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009TJP</classCode><className>BARACK OBAMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

I'm Neil  Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And here's why the president believes it's no big deal not visiting the  border.  Who in the media is really going to call him on it?  Think about  it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've looked into this, my friends, and here is what I discovered.  This  illegal immigration crisis, well, it's not even a crisis.  It's not  inhumane.  The way we are treating these tens of thousands of illegals  dumped on us is what's inhumane.  Not illegal, inhumane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In fact, to the mainstream media, it's not even about illegals at all.   They won't even use the term \"illegal.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, more on that in a second.  For now, I want you to concentrate on how  they're covering this story - not what they are including, what they are  omitting.  It is the way they frame this argument.  It is the way they  discuss this issue by never using the word \"illegal.\"  </p><p>Well, they rid themselves of the nuisance of having to explain all of these  thousands of people who are breaking the law, our laws, our country.  No,  no.  You see, they're not the problem.  We are!  And Republicans, well,  they're even worse.  They're not patriots, they're bigots.  They're not  against illegal immigration, now, they're just against all immigration.   It's morphed into that.  </p><p>Get ready for this, because what I'm about to show you proves it.  These  are unedited, undoctored, very real clips, headlines, stories from a  sampling of news items on the ongoing illegal immigration mess that never  use the word \"illegal\" once.  Not once.</p><p>The Washington Post, June 30th: \"It's OK that Congress won't act on  immigration.\"</p><p>The L.A. Times, July 5th: \"A mounting backlog of immigration courts...\"</p><p>BusinessWeek, this week: \"With immigration reform dead on Capitol Hill,  President Obama says he will use his executive authority to make changes to  the law himself.\"</p><p>NBC News' Matt Lauer urging viewers to share their thoughts on Twitter by  calling these latest immigrants - not illegal immigrants - immigrants by  #RefugeeRiders and they are never to be called \"illegal\" at all.  NBC  choosing instead the term \"undocumented\".  Ditto CBS.</p><p>In fact, the L.A. Times and the Associated Press have announced a ban on  the term \"illegal immigrants.\"  They say it broadly and unfairly labels a  large group of people.  </p><p>Well, that makes things easy, doesn't it?  Sort of like dispensing with the  term \"global warming\" after a few harsh winters then ta da!  It's climate  change.  Who can argue with that?</p><p>So now by saying we have an immigration crisis, you could say that anyone  who's against these waves of illegals coming here are anti-immigrant or  worse, anti- I don't know - human being.  Suddenly, they're not for illegal  immigration reform, they're against immigration reform.  Immigration  reform.  </p><p>Leave out the illegal part and you might almost forget the billions we are  spending on processing these tens of thousands of illegal kids dumped in  this country into thinking that they are citizens of this country.  They  are not.  And those opposed to keeping these noncitizens here are racist.   They are not.  </p><p>You see, when you leave out words you don't like, you can kind of say  anything you do like.  But let me tell you something.  I can call myself  \"calorically-challenged\" instead of \"fat\" to make myself feel good but that  doesn't make me any less fat.  So fat chance it'll make me anymore aware.</p><p>But those are my thoughts.  I'd love to hear yours.  Use #Cavuto and I'll  share them with the world.  </p><p>First to Accuracy in Media Editor, Roger Aronoff.</p><p>Roger, this started as a curious little project on my part - just seeing  what I could get just hearing and reading media stories - and it's true.   \"Illegal\" doesn't happen.  It's a word you can't find.  What happened?  </p><p>ROGER ARONOFF, ACCURACY IN MEDIA EDITOR:  Oh, you're exactly right, Neil.   Great to be with you today and it was a great setup.  Yes.  For instance,  the Associated Press took it out of their style book so that you can no  longer say \"illegal aliens\" because it's too judgmental and it might hurt  someone's feelings so they've just removed it from the lexicon.  It's only  used to describe actions and not people.  And that just serves--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  But they will freely write stories of - those critical of what  we're doing right now at the border - they can still be called \"bigots\".   They can still be called \"obstructionists\" or God knows what.  But  \"illegal\" somehow is now taken on a bad connotation and who are we afraid  of offending again?</p><p>ARONOFF:  Well, that's right.  What's going on here, I believe, is that  there's an agenda.  They are pushing for this so-called comprehensive  immigration reform also known as amnesty and they also want to protect  President Obama.  They have a lot invested in him.  So this is what they're  doing.  I mean, we're looking at this 50,000 children that have come over  but there's really even a much larger story.  There was a piece in the New  York Times last week and this is the New York Times that acknowledged that  since April alone, there have been 240,000 adult migrants - they call them  - that have come across as well and most of them are just released to go  where they want to in the U.S.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And back and forth and back and forth.  The recidivism is beyond  the pale.  But here's what is amazing to me.  When you ignore the obvious  and you've written about this brilliantly, then you don't do what should be  obvious.  When you talk about the rights of illegals or illegals have to be  given a license to drive and illegals  - in some communities - they even  have to be given the right to vote.  In New York City, they're debating  that as we speak and I'm thinking to myself, \"What part of 'illegal' do  they not understand?\"  What part of 'noncitizen' do they not understand?   What part of stealing their way across the border for whatever reason do  they not understand?  And then I'm thinking of all the well-intended  immigrants who are coming here and going through the process, who also  write me and say, \"What the heck?\"  </p><p>ARONOFF:  You're absolutely right.  I mean, this is the worst it's for the  legal aliens - the people who do the right thing and get in line and come  here - and this flood of illegal immigrants has created massive headaches  for them and for many of us who are really very pro-immigrant but anti- illegal immigrant, it's - this is a disaster and it's really a manufactured  crisis.  You look back at a couple of things.  Obama's trying to blame this  back on this 2008 law that really, there was the 2012 DACA - Deferred  Action for Childhood Admissions - and the other thing is that we know there  was a contract put out in January of this year that specified 65,00  children coming here calling for escorts to bring them here.  So they have  known this exactly and this is really a manufactured crisis and now, even  this week, we've seen this other kind of maneuver where first they put out  that it was going to be 1.8 billion, and then all of a sudden, no, it's 3.7  billion.  They've tried to find--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Oh, it'll go steadily higher than that, Roger,  But your points  are all well taken as usual.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p>Oh, by the way, I was thinking of Nancy Pelosi also changing the fact it's  not a border issue, that this is an Americas issue - North America, Central  America, South America.  We're all one.  Who knew?  I had to go back and  look at my (INAUDIBLE) now.</p><p>All right.  To former Florida Republican Congressman Allen West who's seen  and heard enough. </p><p>What do you think of this, Congressman?  Illegal, no more, don't use it?</p><p>FMR. REP. ALLEN WEST, (R) FLORIDA:  Well, Neil, you hit the nail on the  head when you start looking at how liberal progressives changed the  lexicon.  They are not \"illegal immigrants\".  They're \"undocumented  workers.\"  You don't have \"drug dealers\", you have \"unlicensed  pharmacists\".  You don't even have \"combat operations\", you have \"overseas  contingency operations.\"  You have \"man-caused disasters\" instead of  \"terrorist attacks\".  And in recently, just out in California, we don't  have \"husband and wife\" anymore, we have \"spouse one and spouse two\".  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You're right.</p><p>WEST:  So you're right.  As you change the language, then you make the  thing that is obvious and the problem that should be dealt with completely  un-dealable.  You can't deal with it anymore because then--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, that's just it.  If you don't even define the problem, you  can't address the problem.  If you don't see the problem and just call it  like something else and equate the same rights and standards to people who  shouldn't be here that you do the people who already are here, the people  who already are here get a little annoyed and the people who want to  legally get here and go through the process of becoming permanent citizens  here - they get annoyed too.  </p><p>WEST:  Well, they get discouraged.  I mean, look at what is happening as  far as the release of those five senior members of the Taliban.  Everyone  is calling them \"prisoners of war\".  That's not what they are.  They are  \"unlawful enemy combatants\" and they don't deserve any rights.  And these  non-state, non-uniform belligerents that are captured on this modern  battlefield basically not represented or not recognized by the Geneva  Convention, but yet, what do we continue to do just like this gentlemen  Khatallah that we brought back from Libya, we get them constitutional  rights, we get them lawyered up.  So--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I think we're way too politically correct (INAUDIBLE), not even  your camp or Sarah Palin's camp that we should start filing impeachment  charges against the president.  I understand your frustration though.  But  I - what I'm saying is we are so super careful - go ahead.</p><p>WEST:  My frustration - my frustration is very narrowly defined with the  president because I see a national security threat and that's why I see  high crimes and misdemeanors.  When the President of the United States of  America makes a unilateral decision to release five senior members of the  enemy while the enemy is still engaged in combat operations against us,  that's providing material, comfort, and aid to an enemy.  That's aiding and  abetting your enemy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, no, no.  I see your point there.  I'll respectfully disagree  with you.  I can do so because you're in remote.  If we were here in  person, you'd hit me so I feel safe in doing this right now.  But Allen, I  will say this and I've already pushed time here but I am overly concerned  about this incredible political incorrect environment in which we live and  now how the media's signing onto it with one of the biggest crisis we face  - that is our problem at the border - because you have a complicit media  saying, \"What problem at the border?\"  </p><p>WEST:  Yes.  You're absolutely right and you have a Nancy Pelosi who says  it's not a crisis, this is an opportunity.  You have Valerie Jarrett who is  changed the--</p><p>CAVUTO:  An - exactly.  That was (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WEST:  --changed the language.  It is a \"humanitarian situation\", not a  \"humanitarian crisis\".  And you do have a complicit media that's going  along with it and that affects your ability to be able to make proper  decisions to rectify the situation.  But Neil, in closing, remember this -  we have a President that went around the Congress and he enacted by  executive order an immigration policy which has now caused this problem  down on our southern border.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, I just heard the back and forth and he was blaming the  Republicans but for now, Millard Fillmore hasn't been blamed by I'm sure  given time, Fillmore and his shenanigans will come to light.</p><p>Allen West, it's always good having you.  Thank you very, very much.  </p><p>By the way, political correctness still stands for the \"calorically- challenged\" instead of \"fat\".  That one I'll let stay.</p><p>Meanwhile, did you hear about this Google executive - big, big tech  executive, gets killed by a prostitute - we are told - allegedly.  They  met, connected on a social media site.  The guy who heads that site, after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEP. CHIEF STEVE CLARK, SANTA CRUZ POLICE:  So callous that in gathering  her things, she was literally stepping over the body and at one point,  stepped over the body to grab a glass of wine and finish the glass of wine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  This is a murder that is now suddenly rocking the tech  world.  It's even on the mainstream papers.  </p><p>To Fox Business reporter Jo Ling Kent on the details that are beginning to  come out.  What do we know about this?</p><p>JO LING KENT, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Well, Neil, we do know that this was  a liaison that had perhaps happened several times.  Allegedly, the woman  involved injected heroin into a 51-year-old Google executive's body.  He  died.  And like you just heard there, she had an extra sip of wine before  she left.  She stepped over the body.  She closed the shades, closed the  yacht, and left.</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right.  Now, that's the charge.  Now, Forrest Hayes is a big  Google exec, his yacht, married, so all the complications with that.  They  meet on a social site - we're going to get into that in a second.  Was  there any - was there any signs prior that either she had a record or he  had reason to be concerned?</p><p>KENT:  Well, reports say that she's had about 200 differently liaisons and  looking at him, according to the Santa Cruz police, this was an extended  type of affair.  Now, what's interesting here is she's been charged-</p><p>CAVUTO:  You say \"extended\".  Had they had met prior to this instance?  </p><p>KENT:  Repeated - yes, repeated contacts.  And this is coming from evidence  off of the cell phone of Mr. Hayes.  And she's been charged with four  different counts.  But you should know it's manslaughter, administering and  transporting and possessing heroin, excuse me, prostitution, and destroying  evidence.  So this is a very serious case.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So the charges that she shot the heroin into him, that she would  not have known in that case - if this is true - that it would have killed  him--.</p><p>KENT:  Santa Cruz police are saying that he was welcoming the drug usage.   So the issue though, of course, is that she's possessing illegal drugs.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.  And injects it into someone else, allegedly.  He dies, now  it's manslaughter.  Now, it's a mess.</p><p>KENT:  Right.  And what's really a mess is taking a look at it from the  bird's eye view of Silicon Valley.  I reached out to Google.  They say they  have no comment other than their hearts go out to the family of Mr. Hayes.   But overall, looking at the case, there is a lot of excess and a lot of  wealth involved in Silicon Valley.  This individual - Mr. Hayes - has  worked at Sun.  He also worked at a couple of other major tech companies.   So-</p><p>CAVUTO:  But those guys always tend to get a fair rap in the press.  I  mean, well, for Wall Street - but that's a Wall Street guy.  Those guys -  you expect bad behavior.  That's the way these things tend to be treated.</p><p>KENT:  It's true that Silicon Valley has a very different reputation  especially among the wealthy.  They're known to be more modest.  Looking at  some of their boards - the bulletin boards regarding his obituary, a lot of  people really looked up to him.  They said he was one of the best bosses  they've ever had.  He worked on Google Glass.  He was clearly an innovator,  an executive at Google who set a very high standard according to those who  say they worked with him.  So this is - it's a very tragic case overall.   Very messy.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yes.  Very messy, in an industry we don't see a lot of, at least  some established press.  </p><p>Jo Ling, thank you for breaking that down for us.  </p><p>In the meantime, the website they allegedly met on, SeekingArrangement.com  founder and CEO Brandon Wade joins me right now on the phone.</p><p>Brandon, do you screen those who use your site?</p><p>BRANDON WADE, SEEKINGARRANGEMENT.COM CEO (ON THE PHONE):  There is some  screening that happens, obviously.  We look at every single profile of  members when they submit a profile to make sure that they don't violate  against our policy.  We look at the pictures that they upload.  And of  course we rely on members reporting each other so there's some sort of a  community self-policing that goes on.  And it's important to note that the  alleged, I guess, the female - her profile had never received a single  report on the site.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Not on the site but there were reports prior.  But are you saying  it's not your site's responsibility then to start putting that up there as  well, or what?</p><p>WADE:  Well, what I'm - what I'm saying is there has been no reports.  That  means no other members have actually reported on her account or her profile  as having done something wrong.  And her profile certainly looks normal,  just like any other dating profile out there.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Are you doing anything differently now, Brandon?  That if all this  turns out and that this woman is (INAUDIBLE) manslaughter and did inject  this guy with heroin and he dies, are you going to change anything,  anything more of a screening process?  Is this just a glaring, tragic  exception, what?  </p><p>WADE:  As it is, we already have background check as an option on our  website.  I'll let you know, neither of them have--</p><p>CAVUTO:  But should it be an option?  In other words, should it be an  option?  If there's the risk of something like this happening, should that  now be a requirement?  </p><p>WADE:  Well, that's a tough thing because even if you make it a  requirement, people will still meet no matter what.  They'll meet at the  bar.  They'll meet anywhere.  What we tell people to do is just be careful.   I mean, this is case of recreational drug use gone wrong.  Don't use drugs.   I mean, that's the moral of the story here.</p><p>CAVUTO:  There's always a risk at this sort of thing, to your point.  I  remember the Craigslist murders where this sort of thing that was  happening.  So it must be, I guess, user beware.  But for those who hook up  on sites such as yours, do you issue warnings?  Is there something you say  upfront that \"Be careful here.  Know what you're getting into.\"  What?  </p><p>WADE:  Absolutely.  I mean, we tell people how to date safely.  I mean,  there's a whole bunch of stuff.  And - but this is - this is a really weird  situation too.  They have actually been seeing each other for a while.   They have had several meetings.  This is not a one-off-type relationship.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Are you worried though that through no fault of your own, Brandon,  that people are going to hear about your site and say, \"Oh, that was the  one with the crazy hook-up in which the top executive died and it's just  too messy and let me go to some other site\"?  </p><p>WADE:  The funny thing you should ask that because yesterday, we had the  record-breaking day in terms of the number of sign-ups.  And today is  looking (INAUDIBLE) yesterday.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Really?</p><p>WADE:  So I'm not really sure why.  But every time there's a bad news, it  seems to be good news for our website.  It's really strange.</p><p>CAVUTO:  In other words, it would be more guys than women, more women than  guys, what?  </p><p>WADE:  Well, typically more women sign up than men.  And of course, with  this news going out there with - as breaking news, we are seeing way more  men signing up in the last two days.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Amazing.  Brandon Wade.  Thank you.  Hope this all works out.  It  is sad.  Hopefully, it's an exception, far from the rule.  Brandon Wade.</p><p>All right.  You probably heard this latest talk that Citigroup is close to  settling a $7 billion fine with the United States government.  In case  you're counting, worth what - $30 billion in bank fines?  I am far from a  big supporter of banks and over that they are without sin.  But is it me or  do they keep coming up as the only sinner?  Just weird.  After this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Normally, we get a lot of comments over something I've said or  discussed on this show or my Fox News show.  But this concerns something I  wrote for our Fox Business website about all these bank fines - the latest  $7 billion likely slapped on Citigroup - likely double that for Bank of  America for their respective parts in the meltdown you would think that  only they had caused.  So I started asking where is the punishment for the  politicians - the ones who egged them on, pushing them to making more  loans, turn home ownership from a goal to (INAUDIBLE) birthright.  </p><p>Jane in Anthem, Arizona: \"Neil, I worked in the mortgage industry during  the fiasco.  Your accountability was the absolute best description I've  read.  The real truth is what the banks were encouraged and sometimes  forced to do by our government has not widely been published.  Thanks for  you for this honest account.\"</p><p>J.A. in Carson City: \"Hey, you jerk!  It's not just the banks that have  paid a price for the - he said \"damn\", that's where I'm going to leave it -  financial farce.  My family will never recover from the lost value of our  home.  And the banks deserve to pay every dime of the punishment they get!   Get your f*ing facts straight before you start preaching.\" </p><p>And J.A., banks are the only one responsible for what happened?  No one  else?  Zero?  Just them?  Really?  Who is the jerk, sir?  Who is the one  who has to get his facts straight before preaching?</p><p>Harry e-mails: \"Thanks, Neil.  First article I've read in a long time  placing the blame for the 2007-2008 financial breakdown where it belongs.\"</p><p>\"Some of your points like the Community Reinvestment Act are rarely  mentioned anymore.  Where do all the receipts the government has received  in the form of penalties go?  Does it go right back to the Treasury?\"  </p><p>Well, pretty much, Rick.  It does.  It all goes back into the same big old  pot and around and around she goes.</p><p>All right.  To our Fox Biz All-Stars, Monica Mehta, Jonathan Hoenig, and  Mattie Duppler.</p><p>Jonathan, what do you make of this?</p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Oh, Neil, there's been a  con job perpetrated on the American public over the last five or six years.   And this idea that Wall Street caused the collapse, it was greedy profit- seeking financiers and unregulated speculators that caused the collapse.   In fact, Obama made a video saying just that.  In reality, all elements of  the financial system that failed were regulated and the ones that failed  the most were regulated the most.  To allude to your (INAUDIBLE) too many  of them - the Community Reinvestment Act.  So the free markets don't fail  but we didn't have a free market and that's what exactly what caused it to  fail and will continue to cause failures in the years to come.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And I've been around long enough and I'm covering all of this that  I can distinctly remember Congresses and Presidents of both parties saying,  \"You know you're not lending enough\", that we've got a housing boom here  potentially right beneath us, \"Why don't you get with the program and start  lending more?  Loosen standards a little bit so we can get more people in  on the fun.\"  And this was the emergence of no doc loans where people with  $50,000 incomes could buy million-dollar homes and better.  They bear some  responsibility.  The politicians who egged this on bear some  responsibility.  Yet they're the ones who are handing out these  punishments.  Again, I am not saying that banks (INAUDIBLE) responsibility  for securitizing a lot of the stuff, (INAUDIBLE), selling suspicious debt  on maybe unbeknownst investors even though a lot of those investors knew  exactly what they were buying.  But I'm tired of the blame game and then  only blaming them for it.  </p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM DIRECTOR:  Right.  And I mean, the  question you're asking is an important one.  Who's regulating the  regulators?  And the answer is no one or they're regulating themselves.  I  mean, a lot of these guys over at the Consumer Protection Bureau - they  have had all of their - all of the regulations essentially taken off of  them with the advent of Dodd-Frank and now they're just - they're acting as  regulators gone wild because they don't have rules that govern them  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, they left Fannie and Freddie out of this because of  their political kinships and friendship.  So that's sort of like leaving  Charles Manson out of the discussion of the Sharon Tate murders.  </p><p>But my only other issue, Monica, is look, right after the meltdown,  immediately, Congress said, \"You lent too much.  You were going crazy.\"  A  few months after the meltdown, they said, \"Why aren't you lending?  You're  drying up lending.\"  I tell you, these banks can't win for love or money.</p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL MANAGING PRINCIPAL:  Well, I think banks  deserve the angst that they get.  But to your point, which politicians are  holding politicians accountable and which voters are holding politicians  accountable?  If you look at polls of how people feel about Congress--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I bet those politicians right now who are telling them \"Open up  the spigot.  You're being too tight in your lending standards.\"  The same  standards that they advocated for right after the meltdown.</p><p>MEHTA:  Right.  And then we're talking about how there isn't enough talk--.</p><p>CAVUTO:  I want to see their photos in post offices around the country.</p><p>MEHTA:  And aspects of Dodd-Frank have made it much harder for small  businesses to actually get lending.  There's all sorts of hypocrisy in all  sides of it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Because Washington's cures make the illness worse.  That's where I  come from (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HOENIG:  And Neil, you saw the same thing we mentioned with Dodd-Frank a  few times.  Think back what a decades with Sarbanes-Oxley.  That was past  reaction to the last big financial crisis.  Remember Enron and Adelphia -  that caused a lot of small companies not to be able to go public because of  the expense it will raise some more.  So every time we get a crisis caused  by government, controls breed more controls.  You get more control.  I  think that's why despite all the regulation that was supposed to fix the  financial crisis - to Monica's point - we haven't seen the lending pick up.   We also haven't seen the job creation and employment pick up that's  directly due to these controls in the financial sector.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Bottom line, we're all human beings and we all make our own bed  and we all are realistic enough when we sign on a loan.  But we signed it.   Nope, no one coerces it.  I have yet to run into a McDonald's and the  manager force feeds me a double Quarter Pounder.  I did it myself!  </p><p>Meanwhile, when we come back, a federal judge today looking for answers on  the IRS and all this targeting Conservatives.  But did we just find the one  smoking gun? Via an e-mail that we thought was missing?  After this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  All right, but we warned you about this judge who is now looking  into the whole e-mail mess and the targeting conservatives at the IRS, but  did he just find a smoking gun?  A former IRS director admitting in e-mail,  no less, that she warned employees about what they write in the e-mails.   Even asking a tech employ at the IRS which messages and emails are  traceable.  Back with the all-stars, Monica, Jonathan, and Maddie.  Mattie,  this is your smoking gun.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM DIRECTOR:  You would think so,  right?  You have someone warning her employees not to e-mail sensitive  things in an e-mail.  So that in and of itself demonstrates not only .</p><p>CAVUTO:  That would be like me e-mailing my staff, could you kind of erase  the e-mails like .</p><p>DUPPLER:  Emails, right.</p><p>CAVUTO:   They don't, they save them.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  So, I mean it's speculative just in the context of what she's  saying but she also seemed to get it wrong.  She was asking about whether  or not the messages are available to Congress or they'll be deleted?  That  kind of thing.  That shows that there was some kind of intent there, some  kind of interest in keeping whatever it was she was IM'ing or e-mailing  secret.  So that raised the question right there.   And the fact that we  now have a judge who thinks that the American public deserves an answer for  that, I think, is a very important step towards getting to the bottom of  that.</p><p>CAVUTO:  And this is the same judge who wanted the heads up on how did all  these e-mails go disappearing and why didn't give us a heads-up earlier on  how they all disappear.  Practically wanting to subpoena the server they  were on.  </p><p>MONICA MEHTA, SEVENTH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPAL:  Look, highly unusual,  I mean you don't have emails disappear from six different computers for six  different users.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Certainly, not at the IRS.</p><p>MEHTA:  It is not uncommon to be a corporate policy that you should watch  what you e-mail.  I mean back when e-mail was young in the 1990s you could  .</p><p>CAVUTO:  This is about hiding it.  </p><p>MEHTA:  Right, but so it's all in the context.  But if it is just watch  what you e-mail, like that is common communication policy.</p><p>DUPPLER:  But if she's a manager, why does she have to inquire about this  at this point?  What, five, ten years into her career.  Shouldn't you  already know this if you are in charge?</p><p>CAVUTO:  Because going on to say, John, - but when you start mentioning  things in e-mail and discerning what are traceable messages and e-mails,  that gets into the icky category.  </p><p>JONATHAN HOENIG, CAPITALISTPIG ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Well, if it's purposely  deceptive, Neil.   If that was in a corporation, it would be totally  unacceptable and potentially criminal.  This isn't even a corporation.   Those aren't a company's computers, those are the people's computers.  And  Lois Lerner is in a high-level executive at Cisco or Microsoft.  She's  literally a gun.  That's what the IRS is.  It's government force brought to  individuals finances.  So in the most transparent administration in  history, it's more than a little bit suspect that six hard drives with the  smoking gun as you point out at it, potentially the smoking gun, suddenly  go missing.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Suddenly go missing, that's right.  That just doesn't make sense,  you know?  Normally all e-mails should disappear when that happens.   </p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.  Maybe we should be combining the NSA and the IRS, maybe  that's what the solution is here.  The president is trying to expand what  the kind of bureaucracy we already have. </p><p>CAVUTO:  If you are going to hide stuff, guys, you got to hide everything.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Just advise you.  Criminal.  Anyway, here's why the president is  not going to the border.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  This isn't  theater.  This is a problem.  I'm not interested in photo-ops. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You're not interested in photo-ops?  Then I'm not interested in  ponderosa buffets.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yeah, one of my next guests buying a car sight unseen.  I'm going  to go ahead and  buy this car, without seeing, it I have a good idea what  it's like, and I'm going to put in my order and hopefully they'll deliver  to my house.  Would you do that?  Maybe if it's really new cars.  Maybe  some of you would.  But you certainly want to kick the tires or certainly  read up on the car you're about to buy.  But the president is doing the  equivalent of that sight unseen, not going to the border and then, at the  same time arguing for $3.7 billion to address this border mess and the  processing for this better than 50,000 largely kids who just made their way  here.  All right.  So do those two connect?  Leaving aside the fact that  the president argue that he didn't want to go to the border because he's  not into photo-ops, which, of course, he is.  All right.  We have auto  dealer Mark Calisi here and real estate expert Katrina Campins.  As the  auto guy, Mark, how many customers of yours do that?</p><p>MARK CALISI, AUTO DEALER:  Zero.  </p><p>CAVUTO: right?  </p><p>CALISI:  Zero.  Imagine you come into my dealership to buy a car and I'm  saying you, Neil, give me a check for$50,000 first, then I'll let you look  at the car, then I'll tell you about the options, but not until you give me  a check for 50,000, and I deposit it.</p><p>CAVUTO:  You would scare me.  So I would do that.  Just to get of the  showroom.  But I mean.  No, it just - Right?  It defies credulity?</p><p>CALISI:  It's not.  It's outrageous that he's asking for $3.7 billion from  the American taxpayers to handle these illegal, and I say illegal  immigration crisis without having any type of a plan.  And just we went  into a bank and wanted to borrow $10,000.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, it was like you were dealing when the auto bailouts and  everything else - in the effect.  He didn't reason out the fallout for good  dealers who are having good sales and being forced to shut down or  relocate, whatever, without thinking it through.</p><p>CALISI:  A lot of people got hurt, a lot of families got hurt and the  taxpayers are going to get hurt.  Now the dealers suing the federal  government and the federal government is ready to stop paying the dealers  back.</p><p>CAVUTO:  So, there is nothing of GM and the separate lawsuits.  You're  right.  But Katrina, what I wonder about is, how this looks now, the  president not going to the border.  That's just once and all - the whole  thing that he doesn't like photo-ops was a little strange to me.  But what  damage is done here and how - wouldn't it hurt his cause to get that 3.7  billion?  </p><p>KATRINA CAMPINS, REAL ESTATE EXPERT:  Well, from my industry's perspective,  which is real estate, nobody purchases a home without sight unseen.  The  same thing with .</p><p>CAVUTO:  No, they did during the boom.  They did during the boom.  They  were buying condos, sight unseen.  </p><p>CAMPINS:  Preconstruction. </p><p>CAVUTO:  Right.</p><p>CAMPINS:  But Neil, many of those people did come in to do the final walk  through before they actually closed on the property.  But those days are  really no longer.  Even in preconstruction projects right now, when people  are seeing it sight unseen, they still are doing the walk through and they  still are making sure that they feel the actual products, especially  because there's more required down now.   So, the days of only putting 5  percent down are over.  As far as large - but in the luxury market, for  instance, the $2 million, $3 million, $4 million homes.  People want to see  those homes.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yeah, what about the 3.7 billion dollar homes.  How does that go?   Well, a good point, guys.  I mean I'm just saying that anything that costs  a lot, I would like to check it out.  And, you know, Mark, to your point,  accountability means everything and accountability means visibility.  It  means seeing what you're getting into.  </p><p>CALISI:  I agree.  Like I said to you before, I have never seen in all my  years in business, someone just laying out a blank check and saying trust  me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CALISI:   Don't go there.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  So you worry with this border issue is what?  That we can't trust  whatever deal we get or it's going to get more expensive or it's going to  be a waste, what?</p><p>CALISI:  Since there isn't a plan, one it is going to become more  expensive.  Right now the only thing we're doing is housing the women, men  and children coming over the border right now.  We do not have a plan to  move forward.  We have a plan with Mexico because -- and Canada as a  continuous - as a border state.  But why don't we have that same plan with  Honduras and El Salvador and Guatemala? Why don't we have it with them?   And just put them right back to where they were.  No, we have that due  process.  The American taxpayers are paying for this.  The 3.7 billion is a  drop in the bucket compared to what it really - is going to be down the  road.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  And Katrina, if I could belabor, you are one of the best real  estate people I know.  But I do know a thing or two when you look to buy a  home, a lot of your types, those who are very good at this, they'll dress  it up.  They'll make sure it's an inviting home.  Sometimes you put vanilla  candles or something like that where it makes it alluring.  So that when  you go in there, you know, I might go ahead and invest in this or look  around in this.  There's been none of that done with this deal, and I think  what scares me is, we haven't even tried to make it an inviting deal.   We've just got ahead and say, there, there's the price, pay it or else? </p><p>CAMPINS:  Well, I think a lot of people are concerned with this particular  bill, because given Obama's history with other bills, there has been an  influx of money, but then there hasn't been a plan of action.  It costs the  taxpayers and then there's no execution plan.  So I think that's the major  concern.  And that's a lot of money to simply allocate to this particular  bill.  So, but you're right, Neil.  And you know, things need to be staged,  you need to feel it.  You need to have a plan of action before you invest a  large sum of money</p><p>CAVUTO:  Absolutely.  I know when my kids are selling houses, my wife said  we are going to have to take down the Velvet Elvis, just for the sale.   Just so, you know.  All right.  Mark, Katrina, thank you both very, very  much.  We want to hear their perspectives.  Because they know a thing or  two about how that would fly in their industries.  It wouldn't.   All  right, coming up:  What if I told you someone is making double your salary  without even having the job?  I bet they're working right around you, right  now.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Welcome to Google.  This will not be your average  internship. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We are looking at some sort of mental hunger games  against a bunch of genius kids for just like a handful of jobs.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are interns?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Shut up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Deal with it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's so old. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, I should have told my daughter to be an intern, she  should have aimed higher.  News that Twitter interns, are you sitting down?   Well, probably are, it's been a long show, if you were standing up, you'd  be getting tired.  Anyway, they make the equivalent of $81,000 a year.   $81,000 a year.  Back with our all-stars, Monica, Jonathan, Mattie.   Jonathan, what do you think of that?</p><p>HOENIG:  Tell me again about evil big business, you know, just exploiting,  exploiting everybody.  I mean companies are guilty regardless, right, if  they don't pay their interns, they say they are exploiting, you know,  underaged kids, if they do pay their interns, they are catching hell for  that as well.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  You know, that's a very good point.  That's a very good - Is there  happy medium though, can we not be at 80,000 plus, but I do hear your  point.  </p><p>HOENIG:  Well, Neil, the money is wonderful, the real takeaway for these  kids is the self-esteem and the skills they build through the work  experience.   This is why everyone who wants to raise the minimum wage  doesn't get it.   It's not the wage that really matters.  It's the skills,  it's the work experience, it's the work ethic, taking responsibility that's  the biggest payoff from any internship or low level ..</p><p>CAVUTO:  That's going to be ..</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Waiting for that intern.</p><p>DUPPLER:  I'm going to make it a good - I'm going to leave here and go get  an internship at Twitter after this.  But I mean he's right.  This is a  good experience, this is a great .</p><p>CAVUTO:  But is it making kids think that they don't get, that they have  got a lousy internship, it's a waste of time. </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, perhaps if they can't get a job after.  But that's the  whole point of internships, right?  They are supposed to be giving you this  experience and the exposure that you can then use and take with you.  It's  not supposed to be handing you your next job, it's supposed to be something  that does prepare you, but at the end of the day, you know, no matter if  you are working for Twitter or working for McDonald's.  If you're not the  one who is going to hustle, no one is going to hire you. </p><p>CAVUTO:  But we might build in an expectation here, that this is what will  happen for interns now?</p><p>MEHTA:  I don't see the downside of offering a rewarding position to people  who want to work hard and have the skill set.  And at the same token, young  people have the highest level of unemployment.  So, if we are going to kick  them in the ass and say, hey, there are good opportunities.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  By the way, we don't use that kind of language.  </p><p>MEHTA:  I said arse .</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  Very good.  But you know, I asked to do that. </p><p>You know, Johnny, I was thinking about this, and I could always remember as  a kid, I would have a variety of internships, several, and I worked as a  waiter at night.  But I did eat the restaurant out of business, but my  point was that you devalue the experience.  What I'm worried with some  kids, not all, because I think those kids are decent, hardworking, trying  to get ahead just like we did when we were younger.  But you might say,  hey, Twitter is where I want to go, not because it's such a great company,  not because it's such a great opportunity, but because you get this, and  then you could have a short-lived expectation and the short-term view.  </p><p>HOENIG:  Well, Yeah, I mean, Neil, that's a good thing, it's good that  these young people see that if they work hard, if they apply themselves,  they can have tremendous .</p><p>CAVUTO:  They .</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  John, come on.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOENIG:  They are working very hard, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Come up with 140 characters, I'm richer than God on 140  characters.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MEHTA:  #neilisawesome.</p><p>CAVUTO:  Yeah, #neilisawesome.  Very good, you are back. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DUPPLER:  Neil, every time I come on the show, I have to defend my  generation from the new disruptive technology that we're working for.  But,  you know, again, this is a great opportunity for someone to get involved in  what is a new disruptive technology, Twitter.  A couple - when I was  graduating college, Twitter didn't even exist.  So, who knows what the next  thing is going to be.</p><p>CAVUTO:  When I graduated from college, the Internet didn't exist.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO:  It is a big difference, young lady.  Don't rub it in my face.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  But isn't it great that we can both sit on the TV site and talk  about it?</p><p>CAVUTO: no.  </p><p>DUPPLER:  I mean isn't it great, though?  Look at how .</p><p>CAVUTO:  Tweeting about it?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, like I said.</p><p>MEHTA:  They were talking about Pets.com being disruptive.  We'll see what  happens.  </p><p>CAVUTO:  Well, there, but historically, how are we going to look back at  this, John?</p><p>HOENIG:  Neil, people said this is the bubble.  I don't think it's the  bubble.  Industries like Twitter and maybe Pets.com wasn't disrupted, but  it born Amazon.  It bore million other opportunities.  So, I think Twitter  is for real, I think a lot of the new technology is for real and these kids  are blessed to be able to have that firsthand experience.</p><p>CAVUTO:  OK, these kids don't even appreciate how good you have it!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CAVUTO:  And what is the deal with all of these growing calls for President  Obama's impeachment?  Paul in Washington, \"Impeach Obama, but not yet.   After Republicans got a majority in the Senate, then an impeachment would  result in his removal from office.  You need a lot of votes.  Frank in  Louisiana, \"Neil, you were just too damn pragmatic.\"  And a realist who  wants to get real stuff done.  Bill in Florida, \"Neil, he's earned - by  failing to enforcing laws, which is a violation of his oath, but nobody in  Congress has the guts to go after the president.\"  You know, it doesn't  take guts to file briefs against the president.  It takes guts to get stuff  done so you can make well his argument.  Lou Dwayne via Gmail, \"Sorry,  Cavuto, just more smoke and hot air out of both ends of your anatomy.   Blah-blah-talk talk.\"  Dwayne, don't write.</p><p>Jacqueline via Yahoo! \"Yes, the GOP is doing the right thing.  It's about  time.  Impeachment is a must to get our USA back from this tyrant.\"   Stephanie in Tennessee, \"I was dismayed to hear Senator Coburn use the word  ridiculous when you asked him about impeachment.\"  Well, because he said  there were better uses of Congress this time and I think he is right.</p><p>Jim in Washington, \"Congress is a bigger problem than our outlaw president,  they enable him.  Think about it.  Then thousands of illegals at our border  and thousands more being processed, all on our dime, Nora in Texas, \"That's  enough.  You mentioned that the 3.7 billion requested by the president for  the border crisis is for processing 50,000 people.  $74,000 to process each  person?  Seriously.  So, exactly what sort of process is this?  Not a good  one, Nora.  And clearly not a cheap one, either.  Antonio in Florida, \"the  abuse of citizens by the federal government has been increasingly bad and  will get worse.  When are you and others going to realize that we must  split the country?\"  What?  By that reasoning, Antonio, Abraham Lincoln  simply wasted his time trying to keep this country together and keep  slavery a thing of the past.</p><p>The sum of our parts is far greater than any of our individual parts.  I  think we can work all this stuff out without throwing up our arms or just  walking out.  Then to my chat with Garry Johnson, of course, saying this  for making legalizing pot a key part of his presidential campaign.  Now  he's involved with a business that does pretty much that.  And explores  marijuana's myriad of other virtue and uses.  Kelly in New York City,  \"Neil, as someone who suffers from MS, you should be for legalizing a  substance that helps fellow sufferers deal with the pain.\"  If it helps  them with the pain, fine, I'm fine with that.  John via AOL, \"Cavuto, did  you see how Johnson's hair was all messed up?  Classic druggy.\"  No, John,  messy hair doesn't mean you are high as a kite, it just means maybe you  didn't stop by a mirror.\"</p><p>Allen via CVS, \"Cavuto, if you are not stoned out of your mind, then I  frankly don't know what explains your spacy performance and clueless  demeanor.\"  Allen, that is me wrong.  Tommy in North Carolina, \"I really  enjoyed the Gary Johnson interview.\"  I think you are the only anchor of  Fox News, not just the Fox Business channel who has been fair to former  governor.  But you should have made clear that he hasn't done drugs or had  a drink for that matter for decades.\"  Well, it's very good to know, Tommy,  although sometimes I wonder as I told the governor myself.</p><p>Crack-head writes, Jeez, I want to know this is going to be about, \"Dude,  you were so high doing that interview admit it.\"  Dude, I so was not.  Who  uses language like that?  Cantor emails, \"Cavuto, the last thing a guy your  size should be pushing for is legalizing marijuana.  You, my friend, do not  need munchies.\"  And you, my friend, do need to write me.  So stop.  The  rest of you, have a great night. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2014 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Most people are unaware that when Bernie first ran for Congress-- as an independent-- the Democratic Party ran establishment candidates against him. In his first congressional campaign (1988) the Democrats ran a conservative spoiler, Paul Poirier, state House majority leader, who allowed a Republican, Peter Smith win the seat: \u2022 Peter Smith (R)- 98,937 (41.2%) \u2022 Bernie (I)- 90,026 (37.5%) \u2022 Paul Poirier (D)- 43,330 (18.9%) Some in the Democratic Party didn't give a rat's ass; they opposed Bernie as vigorously as they opposed Smith, maybe more so. And in 1990, they ran an African-American woman, Dolores Sandoval, in the hope of pulling away votes from Bernie, whose popularity was surging. They knew she had no chance to win, but they preferred to see the Republican incumbent reelected than the independent SOCIALIST win. But the independent socialist did win... and by a lot: \u2022 Bernie (I)- 117,522 (56.0%) \u2022 Peter Smith (R)- 82,938 (39.5%) \u2022 Dolores Sandoval (D)- 6,315 (3.0%) Bernie entered Congress in January of 1991 and began caucusing with the Democrats. The Party didn't like his influence and the Democratic establishment wanted to get rid of him ASAP. He talked about how the Democrats and the Republicans represented the interests of wealthy donors, not the interests of working families. It hit a nerve with the Democrats because it was true and it was embarrassing for them. In 1991, he founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus which he hoped would offer progressives a way of distinguishing themselves from Democrats. (Brief tangent: The current co-chair, Mark Pocan, a more conventional liberal Democrat, must have lost sight of that when he started recruiting New Dems into the caucus, watering it down and wrecking its credibility.) In 1992, the Democrats ran Lewis Young in the hope of taking away enough votes from Bernie to allow the seat to flip back to the GOP. The disgusting strategy failed again-- and Bernie's popularity soared: \u2022 Bernie (I)- 162,724 (57.78%) \u2022 Tim Philbin (R)- 86,901 (30.86) \u2022 Lewis Young (D)- 22,279 (7.91%) Howard Dean, then Governor of Vermont, had had enough and persuaded the state Democratic Party to back Bernie. Nonetheless, four years later, the establishment Democrats were flipping out about \"the Socialist\" and tried the same tired trick, which once again, flopped: \u2022 Bernie (I)- 140,678 (55.2%) \u2022 Susan Sweetser (R)- 83,021 (32.5%) \u2022 Jack Long (D)- 23,830 (9.3%) That pretty much ended it-- although Democrat Larry Drown ran against Bernie in 2004, his last run for Congress-- and Bernie clobbered him and the Republican, taking 205,774 votes (67.5%). People in Vermont liked him, more than they liked either of the establishment political parties and their crappy candidates. Today, the wealthy donor class hates Bernie as much as they ever did-- whether the GOP wealthy donors or the Democratic Party wealthy donors. They know that when he says he's for change, it's real and profound change, not a few tweaks around the edges (Obama change). Last week, writing for the New Republic, Alex Shephard noted that Bernie's loudest opponents are party insiders who don't represent a political constituency of any significance[1]-- and their strategy is self-defeating. Bernie is the frontrunner \"and entering the White House in January of 2021 both seem increasingly possible, maybe even probable... [Bernie's] most vocal opponents in the party are an assemblage of establishmentarians and familiar Beltway hands, none of whom speak for a political constituency of any size or significance. Moreover, far from hurting Sanders, this impotent assault is self-defeating, fueling the narrative that party gatekeepers want, at all costs, to keep a political revolution from taking over the Democratic Party.\" There is undoubtedly an ideological component of the anti-Sanders wing of the party that is often framed in practical terms. Attacks on Sanders (and other high-profile Democrats like Rep. Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez) often contend that left-wing goals like socialized medicine will be an electoral albatross, dooming the party to failure in battleground states. These arguments are rarely presented in policy terms, but it's easy to draw a line between an opposition to Sanders rooted in the Democratic Party's donor class and Sanders's high-tax proposals and class-war rhetoric.While there's a growing backlist of articles detailing the resistance within Democratic fundraising circles, most of the criticisms of Sanders center around the question of 'electability.' Media Matters founder David Brock told Politico last month that he believed that Sanders would struggle to unite the Democratic Party's many unruly factions and that his sizable war chest would make it easy for him to stay in the race, even if there were little chance he could win. Former Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill echoed this sentiment to the Times, saying, 'One thing we have now that we didn't in '16 is the uniting force of Trump. There will be tremendous pressure on Bernie and his followers to fall in line because of what Trump represents.'...There's another possible, if unintended, effect of the growing challenges to Sanders from Democratic establishment circles, however. Trump's best chance at victory doesn't come from a democratic socialist claiming the nomination, but from a third-party candidate splitting the vote. Claims from Democratic stalwarts that Sanders can't unseat the president are fool's gold to self-funding candidates like Howard Schultz, who argues that a majority of voters are clamoring for a centrist, corporate candidate. If anyone is splitting the party and undercutting Democrats' chances, if anyone is paving the way for a second Trump term, it isn't Sanders\u2014it's his most obstinate and obstreperous opponents. Play Video[2]And that brings us right to Greg Jaffe's Washington Post piece from yesterday: Capitalism In Crisis: U.S. Billionaires Worry About The Survical Of The System That Made Them Rich[3]. \"For decades,\" he wrote, \"Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way. Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.\" Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late. Play Video[4]The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120 million conference center, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions... or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution-- not a guns revolution-- but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading Winners Take All, a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas' book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100 million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3 billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, [but] I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MFn3t-W0cRc/XLy-UZ0GS6I/AAAAAAABkOs/_1izrjacZaYTBAJ2OnOnOcq-vW9OTZ89gCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-01-29%2Bat%2B4.26.32%2BPM.pngHe\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MFn3t-W0cRc/XLy-UZ0GS6I/AAAAAAABkOs/_1izrjacZaYTBAJ2OnOnOcq-vW9OTZ89gCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-01-29%2Bat%2B4.26.32%2BPM.pngHe</url> trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas' ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed-- in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won... maybe I would've been a traditional neoliberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work; online commerce was decimating retail; and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor?\" said Greg Brockman, chairman of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live. Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist-- Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\"-- to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations. To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said. The same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive,'\" he said.Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies.The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent.On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5 million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of America could take part in the country's tech revolution.The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, California, was a $100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of America. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tige7YYGHeA/XLy-rJ-Oj4I/AAAAAAABkO0/-Lfwq_YYrxsfSaVpdllnefLiTXd-gyBGQCLcBGAs/s1600/RepRoKhanna.pngKhanna's\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Tige7YYGHeA/XLy-rJ-Oj4I/AAAAAAABkO0/-Lfwq_YYrxsfSaVpdllnefLiTXd-gyBGQCLcBGAs/s1600/RepRoKhanna.pngKhanna's</url> blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions.Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: Their grandparents had fought in World War II and helped build the country's industrial age economy. Now they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"...A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.In his gray suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place-- an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters-- even those who worried about capitalism and inequality-- seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.For Khanna it was simple: In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry-- though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score Khanna believed he could help Sanders.\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?'\"The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive.\"That's OK,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"The congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders' revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find. In past discussions on the same topic, I always got the idea that Khanna felt that Bernie would bring a moral urgency-- and system-defying zeal-- to issues of income inequality and unrestrained capitalism, which motivate both of them politically. It looks to me that Khanna, as one of the most prominent of Bernie's surrogates, used his interview or interviews with Jaffe to frame Bernie's policies in terms of far brighter American future, not just for the true-believers but for people who haven't been persuaded yet. If anything, it's this kind of perceptive reporting by Jaffe that will help expand Bernie's base. Let's hope so!Play Video[5] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/153605/impotence-stop-sanders-democrats\">https://newrepublic.com/article/153605/impotence-stop-sanders-democrats</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5tCYg9s0HU\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5tCYg9s0HU</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitalism-in-crisis-us-billionaires-worry-about-the-survival-of-the-system-that-made-them-rich/2019/04/20/3e06ef90-5ed8-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitalism-in-crisis-us-billionaires-worry-about-the-survival-of-the-system-that-made-them-rich/2019/04/20/3e06ef90-5ed8-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9CNEedZBxc\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9CNEedZBxc</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVYFQl54rXU\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVYFQl54rXU</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DOWT1093081555938428390251761700249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DOWT-7597</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VY5-VH61-JCMN-Y424-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4033\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>DownWithTyranny</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Alex Shephard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Vermont</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Giridharadas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Establishment vs Bernie</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Seth Klarman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ro Khanna</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economic inequality</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The office is expected to issue an enforcement notice by the end of this month - Doherty has said the department will appeal against this.</p><p>The DPC is carrying out two further investigations into the department. Sources say both are likely to lead to more negative findings.</p><p>One is the second module of the public services card inquiry that is examining the data kept by the department in relation to the card, including whether officials are processing biometric data on each cardholder. Biometrics refers to an individual's body measurements.</p><p>The department says each card contains a photograph, but insists that no biometric data is stored. It uses facial-matching software and a database to check for fraudulent duplicate claimants and says this is kept to its \"own secure data centres\".</p><p>Separately, the department is under investigation over allegations that it interfered with the independence of its own data protection officer, when it changed an official online data declaration to remove a reference to processing biometric data. The office has issued the department with a draft report indicating that it believes there was a breach of data protection rules through the interference with its data protection officer. The commissioner is considering the department's response.</p><p>Some data protection officials in Europe are concerned that the DPC's high-profile actions against the Irish government may distract the regulator from investigations into Facebook and Google.</p><p>Graham Doyle, the DPC's head of communications, said the commission was experienced at running multiple investigations and had dedicated teams working on the big-tech investigations and public sector cases.</p><p>\"We have grown significantly since 2014, when we had about 30 staff compared with the 140 today,\" said Doyle. \"However, this expansion must continue to ensure we can continue to regulate effectively.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-56301846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-0MX1-F021-611S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This year\u2019s publication, released at the International Journalism Conference in Perugia in early April, takes a sobering tone with the title, \u201cSaving the news: Ethics and the fight for the future of journalism.\u201d</p><p>The topics are diverse, ranging from an in-depth look into journalists\u2019 challenges in South Sudan to the ethics of photographic manipulation. Two themes, however, stand out in both the articles and the coverage surrounding the publication\u2019s release: technology and trust \u2014 both of which place the publication\u2019s topics squarely in the heart of conversations taking place in all corners of the journalism world today.</p><p>\u201cThere's a first world crisis in terms of information, and that can be characterized as a major crisis of trust with the audience,\u201d EJN president and founder Aidan White told IJNet.</p><p>\u201cPeople are confused by the chaos of the internet, about not knowing on what they can rely or what they can't rely,\u201d White, who also contributed to the publication, continued. \u201c[The] result is that people are, on the one hand, refusing to believe anything they read in the media, and on the other hand, believing everything they read in the media.\u201d</p><p>In the publication\u2019s foreword, the Principal of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and chair of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Alan Rusbridger, discusses the rise and fall of tech giants like Facebook, as well as their destructive impact on the news industry. He argues, however, that finger-pointing is as much a distraction as it is a reality.</p><p>Rusbridger also notes two places where he considers journalists to have failed in building trust \u2014 covering both Brexit and climate change.</p><p>\u201cSet aside the politics and ask, what message do we want a sceptical public to believe about journalism?\u201d he writes. \u201cIs it primarily a craft of verification or opinion? Is it there to give a factual basis for debates society needs to have, or is it there to push the beliefs of an individual proprietor or editor?\u201d</p><p>The issue of public skepticism surrounding the media sets the backdrop for many of this year\u2019s articles. Still, the title itself offers more hope than is immediately visible. Rather than being bogged down by challenges, the articles instead serve as both a plea and a roadmap for more solutions.</p><p>While White does not hesitate to sound the alarm about both journalism and, consequently, democracy, he says we\u2019re on the verge of a \u201cgolden age\u201d in journalism.</p><p>\u201cWe are so caught up with the sense of crisis, that we are not aware of it,\u201d he says.</p><p>Frustrated by the nostalgia for a journalism that he says he has never seen, White argues that there was never actually a time when journalism was free from issues of trust. Now, however, his optimism stems from the potential he sees in new technologies that likely will transform the ways in which news is created and distributed.</p><p>\u201cWe have opportunities to provide [the] public interesting information on scale and with the level of efficiency, and with the level of accuracy and relevance, which is unheard of,\u201d says White.</p><p>In the publication, White\u2019s own articles first focus on the role of ethics in the face of danger and authoritarianism, and later, on a case for further regulation of Big Tech.</p><p>Other topics covered in this year\u2019s magazine include hate speech, safety, solutions-focused journalism, governance and more. In total, the articles span the spectrum of topics and geographies \u2014 from Honduras, the Philippines, Spain, Kosovo and more.</p><p>\u201cAs always, we wanted an authentic voice from the regions... [people] that understand the situation to talk really about what's going on,\u201d White explained.</p><p>Looking ahead, White is excited not just about journalism\u2019s potential, but also about the work of EJN. Just last month, for instance, the organization named a new director, Hannah Storm, who kicked off her work by introducing the publication at a panel in Perugia.</p><p>\u201cI think what's she's going to bring to it is a real, fresh energy and some new issues as well. We haven't done enough on issues related to gender, for example,\u201d says White. \u201cWe're going to work more on security issues as well. And Hannah's a really inspiring person to have around in the leadership team, so I think it all looks really good for the future.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1850548I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR0-BR81-JDG9-Y1G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001213</classCode><className>NEWS REPORTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS124</classCode><className>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D0E2</classCode><className>SOUTH SUDAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC382</classCode><className>SUDAN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The tools competition authorities can use to restore fair competition At a citizens\u2019 dialogue in Dublin1, 2, 3, Commissioner Vestager said that the \u2018debate on whether Google search is an essential facility hasn\u2019t concluded yet\u2019, adding: \u2018the most urgent debate is about access to data\u20194. Some big tech platform argue that people don\u2019t really care about privacy as they click all the cookies and pop-ups without reading the details because they want to stay online and continue using the App. However, Europe\u2019s data protection regulators have received more than 95 000 complaints5 about possible data breaches, eight months after the adoption of a landmark EU privacy law. This demonstrates that EU consumers do care about how their data6 is being used and passed to third parties and data brokers7. 1. Does DG Competition agree that personal data is an \u2018essential facility\u20198, in the sense that it is essential for competitors or prospective competitors unable to emerge because a few companies have a monopoly on owning and keeping the data? 2. Can the EU competition authority confirm that structural separation or unbundling is one of the possible tools available to it to restore fair competition under normal market conditions9?</p><p> 3. Can the Commission confirm that it can re-open and reassess the Facebook-WhatsApp merger if new details are brought to its attention or it has previously been supplied with misleading or incorrect information? 1 <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/events/european-commission-representation-ireland-events-citizens-dialogue-eucompetition_\">https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/events/european-commission-representation-ireland-events-citizens-dialogue-eucompetition_</url> en 2       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-</url> 2019/calendar_en?field_editorial_section_multiple_tid=189 3       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com\">https://www.facebook.com</url> /EUIreland 4       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com\">https://twitter.com</url> /simonvandorpe/status/1088740632150134784 5       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20190125112939-5m5xw/\">http://news.trust.org/item/20190125112939-5m5xw/</url> 6       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html</url> 7       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000054_EN.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000054_EN.html</url> 8       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.concurrences.com\">https://www.concurrences.com</url> /en/glossary-of-competition-terms/Essential-facility 9 See my previous Written Question in relation to Android Apps,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN813035720190211</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VD7-BM31-DXCW-D172-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It stated: \u2018calls, furthermore, on the Commissionto consider proposals aimed at unbundling search engines from other commercial services as onepotential long-term means of achieving the aforementioned aims\u2019.In the USA, attitudes toward big tech companies seem to be changing2, as outlined by 48 StateAttorneys General in the Google Antitrust Investigation3.

This is the first pandemic in history in which digital technologies are being used on a massive scale to keep people connected while in isolation, allowing them to telework, follow online courses, shop online or consult health professionals from home. As a result, internet traffic has increased substantially since confinement began. According to EU Member States' national regulators, operators have so far been able to manage this surge, while also introducing many exceptional measures, such as temporarily removing broadband data caps and making extra data and free online content available.The current crisis has highlighted the importance that upgraded telecoms networks and 5G will have for societies and economies. Furthermore, now that confinement has started to ease, it is increasingly clear that digital technology will continue to play a very important longer-term role in controlling the spread of the coronavirus. The scope of contact-tracing apps is likely to expand, and teleworking, telehealth and e-learning are likely to become more prevalent than before.However, the most popular digital apps, whether for e-commerce, social media, videoconferencing or contact tracing are not of EU origin, posing concerns for the EU's digital dependency, competitive advantage and data privacy. In fact, the coronavirus crisis has further consolidated the existing dominance of 'Big Tech'.The pandemic has further exacerbated existing issues; for instance, the digital divide has broadened further and there has been a global rise in cybersecurity incidents. The EU is poised to tackle these issues, while at the same time embracing the digital transformation in our lifestyles and allowing the internet to play a critical role in defeating the virus.In this Briefing Context: A global surge in internet demand Online activities from home Emerging challenges What the EU is doingEPRS European Parliamentary Research Service2Context: A global surge in internet demandMuch of the world's population has gone into confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic. Many have voluntarily chosen to stay at home and telework, or have been asked to do so because of quarantine. Some governments have stepped up restrictions in their efforts to limit social contacts, as a way to slow the spread of the virus. Confinement or lockdown has been used to contain the spread of very contagious viruses and illnesses since ancient times. What makes the current experience of confinement unique is the key role digital technologies have played in helping people, economies and societies to keep going and cope with the isolation and negative side effects. Among digital technologies, the internet has increasingly been in demand, whether for working, learning, shopping, communicating or accessing online content for entertainment. Social distancing has increased the demand for videoconferencing apps, for both business and personal use. For instance, media groups estimate that in-home online data usage has jumped by roughly 20 % on average across the EU and the US, with 300 % growth in use of videoconferencing apps such as Zoom and Skype and 400 % growth in online gaming. Global internet traffic has experienced a year's worth of growth in just a few weeks.This major shift to digital technologies in the EU and elsewhere is generating an unprecedented surge in traffic on telecoms networks. As a result, telecoms service providers have had to do their best to ensure that their internet infrastructure is up to the task, with enough capacity and ability to deliver all services at a high enough level. Demand for broadband communication services has increased in both mobile and fixed networks, with some operators experiencing as much as a 60 % increase in internet traffic compared to before the crisis. In Italy, for example, where the lockdown has been one of the most stringent, data relating to upload traffic has grown by 40 % in some networks. Likewise, in Spain there has been a 40 % increase in internet traffic and a 50 % increase in voice calls.Confinement has forced people to engage in more activities online, which explains the fact that the largest share of traffic increase has been absorbed mainly by the fixed residential network, particularly through Wi-Fi, where the increase has ranged from 20 % to 100 % in different networks around the world. This has resulted in traffic shifting away from city centres, public areas and mobile networks, as people have been commuting a lot less.The pandemic has highlighted the importance of telecoms networks as never before. According to the latest Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) report on internet capacity,1 most EU Member States' national regulatory authorities (NRAs) report of stabilisation and even a decrease in internet traffic from the peak reached in the early days of the pandemic. Yet traffic remains well above pre-pandemic levels. Despite the difficulties, BEREC points out that network operators and content providers have to date successfully maintained2 services and efficiently utilised pre-existing capacity, and in certain cases expanded this capacity.Regulators and telecoms operators have had to take measures urgently to further enhance network stability and resilience. For example, they have had to ensure access for network operators and content providers to communications equipment and data centres, while also enhancing technicians' mobility enabling them to address network-related issues at customers' homes.At the international level, the World Bank reports that due to changes in the volume and geographical patterns of traffic, telecoms network operators have adjusted network configurations and expanded their capacity, while high bandwidth-consuming digital services have temporarily downgraded streaming quality. Collaboration with governments is helping ensure connectivity in remote and rural areas through the use of various technologies. Policy-makers and regulators can alleviate congestion in mobile networks by releasing additional spectrum on a temporary basis, or by approving temporary commercial spectrum transactions between providers to put unused spectrum into service.How digital technology is easing the burden of confinement3For instance, on 27 March, the US Federal Communications Commission granted wireless internet service providers temporary spectrum access for 60 days to help them serve rural communities facing an increase in broadband needs. Similarly, since the start of the pandemic, satellite operators providing broadband connectivity directly to consumers have seen a 15-70 % (depending on the country) increase in data traffic and new subscriptions.In the EU, several operators have implemented customer-friendly measures, for example, by increasing the amount of mobile data in subscription plans for a limited period at no additional charge. The BEREC report indicates that some countries' operators have also been offering additional free services to their clients and to front-line public healthcare staff, and to students; to people without internet access, some operators have offered additional TV content for free.Below is a description of some of the main activities that online users have been carrying out from home, such as teleworking, online education, online health consultation, online shopping and communication, and entertainment through online content.Online activities from homeTeleworkingFollowing many governments' recommendations or orders regarding telework from home, where possible, private-sector companies, which had until now been generally reticent to allow for wide-scale teleworking, have had to adopt it so as to ensure business continuity and reduce the risk of contagion among their staff. For instance, estimates show that only about 5 % of the EU workforce had been regularly teleworking in pre-pandemic times, while this will be the norm in many countries for at least half of 2020. In the US, a 2018 report estimated that 4.3 million people (about 3.5 % of the country's workforce) were working remotely at the time. By contrast, in a March 2020 MIT poll over two-thirds of executives reported that more than 80 % of their workforce was now working from home.According to a report from App Annie, a market data provider, this surge in teleworking accounts for the record growth in business videoconferencing apps, with 62 million downloads in March worldwide. For instance, Microsoft's Work Trend Index report has revealed a daily record of 2.7 billion meeting minutes via Microsoft Teams in a single day \u2013 an increase of 200 % compared to an average of 900 million minutes in mid-March. Similarly, videoconferencing service Zoom saw a 535 % rise in daily traffic in that month, as more and more people have been using it for telework and personal communication. Zoom has gone from 10 million users in December to 300 million daily users in the space of five months, helping lift its share price by almost 150 % since January. Likewise, Cisco Webex, another videoconferencing application, has been peaking at a volume 24 times higher than before.Again due to the pandemic, international business conferences and intergovernmental meetings have had to take place online, which some believe could pave the way for greater participation and openness in international affairs. Yet, videoconferences are also bringing many challenges to multilingual meetings because of the lack of face-to-face communication and technical difficulties.On the other hand, not all companies and sectors are able to telework; for instance, multinationals are more likely to telework than SMEs, and not all jobs lend themselves to teleworking. In Canada, data analysis has shown that teleworking worsens inequality by mostly helping high-income earners.Governments have been providing different types of support to SMEs to help them develop teleworking capacities, including through financial assistance to purchase equipment and assistance in drafting suitable teleworking policies. For instance, according to the OECD, enterprises in Japan are eligible for a subsidy of 50 % towards the cost of installing telework facilities. Likewise, Italy has set up a website for awareness-raising concerning the various available web-based tools that permit remote work and remote education for companies and individuals.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service4Some major tech companies, including Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Dropbox and Google, provide temporary free access to some of their communication and sharing tools to companies and workers.However, teleworking does not come without difficulties for many. For some disadvantaged groups, poor housing conditions may make it difficult to self-isolate and to telework effectively. In general, as children are also at home due to confinement, this adds another challenge to telework, and many staff are doing overtime to catch up on work.The long-term consequences of mandatory teleworking are yet to be seen. Many experts are predicting that it is here to stay and will result in 30-50 % of employees using it occasionally in the near future, as many managers and workers have grown to appreciate its potential and therefore find it more acceptable.Other research shows that the greatest productivity benefit comes from flexible working in normal conditions, when staff are given a choice of how much and when to telework.So far, Big Tech companies such as Google and Facebook have announced that their employees will telework until the end of this year; many other organisations also recommend this mode of work for the time being.Online education from homeAs the coronavirus pandemic has spread across the globe, a majority of countries have announced the temporary closure of schools. According to the latest available data from Unesco, this has affected 1.57 billion pupils in more than 190 countries worldwide, or more than 90 % of the total number globally.Unlike tertiary education institutions, such as universities, which are quite used to delivering online courses, secondary and primary education institutions are less prepared for this mode of learning. According to the OECD, this could be seen as an opportunity for experimentation and for envisioning new models of education and new ways of using the face-to-face learning time. Yet, many lack existing, ready-to-use online materials and have had to create them on the spur of the moment. Some countries already had national school platforms for online learning prior to the outbreak, while others did not and have had to improvise. As a result, videoconferencing apps, such as Zoom, have been widely deployed by schools, as they allow the delivery of a classroom-scale experience. At the same time, younger children are less likely to remain attentive through online lessons and videoconferences. In many instances, teachers have also been less motivated and at ease than in class, and have had the feeling of being monitored.School closure due to confinement is inflicting a loss in development of human capital; furthermore, this measure is affecting children from disadvantaged families more strongly than children from well-educated ones. According to an OECD analysis, in normal times, children from disadvantaged families who have limited access to books and other learning resources at home lose one month of learning over the summer, while children from privileged families do not. An additional widening of disparities is likely to occur during the current period of confinement. Moreover, it is more difficult for schools to control absenteeism, which also affects children from disadvantaged groups more than other children.The OECD distinguishes three layers of the digital divide at schools, as follows: The first layer has to do with the fact that to be able to access online learning materials and digital education platforms, students need to have internet access at home. However, many, particularly those living in rural areas, do not have internet. In addition, there are also problems with the amount and type of devices available for students at home. The second level has to do with the digital use gap: digital tools are less useful for students from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds, as they may have less support at home to help them use these tools more effectively.How digital technology is easing the burden of confinement5The third layer has to do with the school digital gap: the capacities and capabilities of each school to provide digital learning for students, to promote and monitor engagement with the teaching materials, and to provide feedback that helps maximise learning outcomes, are not the same across the board.According to the OECD analysis, most of the education systems covered by the OECD's latest round of assessments under the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) are not ready for the world of digital learning opportunities. For instance, there are countries where internet access at home is close to universal, while in others it reaches just half of 15-year-olds. Yet, according to the European Schoolnet the coronavirus crisis has led to more digital transformation in schools in a few weeks than in the past 20 years, obliging education ministries to rapidly put in place emergency remote-teaching initiatives to support schools. The next PISA assessment will therefore probably reflect this shift.Online health consultationsDigital technologies are becoming critical in the fight against the ongoing pandemic. They have been used, among other things, for online medical consultations from home or for increasing the efficiency in diagnosis and treatment of patients through telemedicine, which, similar to teleworking and online education, has been a novel experience for many. According to a recent market research report, about 84 % of patients using virtual care in March were doing so for the first time. Health workers have been utilising telemedicine to diagnose patients remotely. For instance, China has developed new e-health apps allowing patients to assess their Covid-19 symptoms remotely. Videoconferencing has been helping to diagnose Covid-19 patients in their homes, and has allowed them to remain in touch with their families once they have been hospitalised, including while in intensive care.Patients with existing critical illnesses, who had been reluctant to go to hospital lest they be exposed to Covid-19, have been able to have online consultations from home and have in some cases been monitored remotely. Moreover, thanks to digital health records and e-prescriptions available in many EU countries, it has been possible to refill a prescription remotely, limiting unnecessary contact between doctors and patients and reducing the chances of exposure to the disease.The global telehealth market is therefore expected to grow by 64 % post-Covid-19, compared to the anticipated 32 % pre-Covid-19. Usage and adoption of the virtual care market is also projected to mark a 100 % increase in the remaining eight months of 2020, according to a market research report.Yet, many countries on the losing end of the digital divide cannot benefit from the advantages offered by medical treatment and health prevention delivered digitally. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) with support from Unicef is set to work with telecommunications companies to deliver vital health messaging about Covid-19 directly to people's mobile phones in order to raise their awareness about the pandemic despite the digital divide.Entertainment and communicationStuck in confinement, people are increasingly turning to videoconference apps for personal social interactions, such as keeping in touch with family and friends and following a variety of classes, including fitness, music and cooking, from home. As people stay at home more, they also download more online content and games for entertainment.As a result, social media platforms have recorded historic levels of usage by online participants. For instance, Facebook has experienced an increase of 100 % in voice calls and 50 % in WhatsApp text messaging. Facebook usage overall has increased by 37 %, while China's domestic social media apps have seen usage climb by 58 %. Meanwhile, social networking video app Houseparty has also seen phenomenal growth in European countries such as Italy and Spain during lockdown and confinement. Italy, in particular, has reported a rise in on-line activity, including a 1 000 % rise inEPRS European Parliamentary Research Service6group video chats. Meanwhile, Twitter said in March that it had seen an 8 % increase in the number of its daily average users. A surprise to many has been that voice calls have also increased over the period. In Europe, for example, Spain, Germany and Switzerland have seen a significant increase in mobile voice calls of up to 50 % in recent weeks. Voice-over-Wi-Fi services have seen a 180 % increase in the Netherlands.Regarding entertainment and online content platforms, news websites have been enjoying a resurgence, and streaming is now more popular than ever as people try to stay abreast of the news. Many regional news sites entered traffic measurement site Alexa's top-50 lists for Italy and Spain after the March lockdown.However, other types of content, such as sports, have suffered dramatically due to cancellations of live competitions. As a result, demand for e-sports is rising, and also for online video games. Likewise, artists, creators and cultural operators have been severely affected by the enforcement of social distancing measures and the consequent cancellations or closures of cultural events. At the same time, drive-in cinemas are emerging as an alternative safer formula to watch movies in some countries such as South Korea.Consequently, the demand for entertainment content online has been increasing significantly. Netflix has gained 15.8 million new subscribers worldwide in the first three months of 2020 alone, doubling the pre-pandemic forecast. Netflix has also laid out plans to reopen production on its shows and films, to avoid eventually running out of content.Online shoppingThe current severe health crisis has highlighted the positive aspects of using e-commerce, one of which has been the possibility for quarantined people to order food and other essential items online and get them delivered at home. Confinement and fear of infection are resulting in e-commerce spreading even further to product categories such as groceries. For instance, in one of China's counties most strongly affected by the virus, fresh food sales on JD.com jumped 215 % during a 10-day period in February. Generally, online and offline grocery stores are witnessing 'panic buying' and bulk shopping for categories such as fresh food, household chemicals, personal hygiene and health. Some of these categories have seen 90 % growth rates since the onset of the heath crisis. On the other hand, the crisis has meant people are not reserving travel, hotels or tickets for events online, hitherto one of the biggest areas in online purchasing.Efforts to eliminate human-to-human contact and the touching of cash over fears of Covid-19 contamination have also triggered a rise in contactless payments and contactless pick-up in China; likewise in South Korea, for instance, card and mobile payments grew 30 % between January and February.Another trend that has seen a boost is livestream e-commerce, replacing face-to-face product presentations in shops. Augmented reality or virtual tools adopted by retailers such as Ikea and Wayfair are also increasingly being used to introduce products to customers. The coronavirus crisis has also served to encourage the use of drones to deliver food and medicines. However, there have also been some negative effects.Some sellers have tried to profit from panicked shoppers, among other things by selling face masks and hand sanitisers at up to 2 000 % of their normal retail price on Amazon. The company responded by removing 1 million items from its platform for violating its policies on these fronts. Similarly, Italy's competition authority launched a probe over coronavirus price gouging. In France, over 8 000 persons have signalled fraudulent practices to the authorities on a dedicated investigative platform. Similarly, major e-commerce and marketplace companies in the US including Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Etsy have taken action against sellers who inflate their products' prices, as well as against those claiming their products provide a cure for Covid-19. E-commerce supply chains have also been affected by the pandemic, as a large part of manufacturing is based in China and other affected countries, and some factories have been forced to suspend or lower production.How digital technology is easing the burden of confinement7Freight and international transport have also been disrupted, given the lockdown of some regions and countries and big changes in demand patterns. Amazon's 'prime now' and 'fresh deliveries' have both beenput to the test due to the demand surge that has strained the platform's delivery capacity. Both UPS and FedEx have warned of shipment disruption worldwide and delays in countries most affected by the coronavirus outbreak. This, together with the ongoing US-China trade war, may lead many businesses to expand their manufacturing footprint outside China. The pandemic has highlighted the costs of being dependent on a few suppliers, while also exposing other problems as shown below.Emerging challengesDigital divideThe coronavirus crisis is showing that the digital divide is a reality for 3.5 billion people who cannot access the internet at all, and that this problem needs to be tackled as a matter of priority. According to the ITU, only about half of the global population is connected, with people in poorer regions far less likely to be online, along with women, elderly people and those living in remote and rural areas. Only 19 % of the population living in the least developed countries is using the internet.In the EU, despite basic broadband being available for all since 2015, there exists a geographical urban-rural digital divide in terms of the quality and affordability of broadband networks. Furthermore, there is also a digital divide usage gap for those who are digitally illiterate or with low skills. For instance, not all people have the digital skills to ask remotely for social protection after they have lost their job as a result of the pandemic, or to communicate remotely with public administrations, given that most of them remain closed.Hence, the pandemic is creating an economic crisis that might affect the purchasing power of many people and companies and their ability to afford an internet connection. According to BEREC, many operators in the EU have, throughout the confinement period, continued providing internet services even when bills have not been paid, to allow people and businesses to carry out their online activities from home. Similarly, US broadband and telephone providers have pledged to continue providing residential and small business consumers open access to public Wi-Fi hotspots for a 60-day period, and waive late fees.Nevertheless, broadband provision is not considered an essential service in most countries, and once the immediate crisis is over some users might not be able to pay for their connection.The United Nations target for affordable internet is 2 % of monthly income for one gigabyte of data, an amount deemed to guarantee basic internet access. However, most individuals who make up the offline population live in poverty and therefore do not have the resources to afford an internet connection. In developed countries, such as the US, public utilities such as electricity, gas, water and telephone services, are often subsidised for those who cannot afford them. Some argue that access to an affordable and reliable internet connection should be treated the same way, given its critical role. Resilient and trustworthy telecommunications networks and services are essential as more countries, companies and individuals turn to digital technologies to respond to and cope with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.Upgrading of telecoms networks and 5G deploymentThe crisis has highlighted the need to invest in and maintain robust infrastructure, and to launch the transition to 5G.It is expected that in the medium term regulators could stimulate telecoms operators to deploy more broadband fibre and gradually phase out xDSL technologies.According to European Commission estimates, the EU is short by \u20ac155 billion of the total \u20ac500 billion needed to meet the Commission's 2025 internet connectivity objectives. Among theseEPRS European Parliamentary Research Service8are the set of targets in the5G action plan, aimed at ensuring that the EU will assume a leading global role in the deployment of 5G services.The coronavirus crisis has affected the calendar of some of the spectrum auctions dedicated to 5G this year, causing delays for some of them.3 Other auctions planned for 2020 may still take place as per the Commission's 5G action plan calendar.In a recent event on spectrum and 5G, some argued that the pandemic might lead to a change in the 5G business models, which, once accomplished, could trigger the adoption of 5G. Thus, some suggest that the pandemic might change the 5G concept in such a way as would allow it to have a broader range of applications at home, including in the area of telemedicine. Other remaining questions are what the value of the spectrum will be after the pandemic, also considering the lower purchasing power that some affected business and citizens might have and the fact that 5G-enabled phones and other 5G-related infrastructure could be scarcer, given the disruption in supply chains.Another aspect that could delay deployment is that there have been false claims linking 5G rollout to the spread of the virus, which has resulted in 5G infrastructure being attacked in some countries. Even if different organisations have disproved this misinformation, it continues to inflict damage.At the same time, the economic crisis is also affecting companies in the telecoms sector, although to a lesser extent than other sectors. According to global consultancy and research firm Analysis Mason, a decline of 3.4 % in revenues is forecast for the sector this year, in contrast to a pre-Covid-19 forecast of a 0.7 % increase. Telecoms are relatively resilient and will perform better than the generally negative GDP trends. Furthermore, given telecoms' reinforced status as essential infrastructure, the firm also expects that some governments will include 5G and fibre in stimulus packages to protect the investment made.CybersecurityDuring this unprecedented situation, there has been an increase in malicious cyber-activity across EU Member States. Criminals are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to their own advantage, as revealed by a recently published Europol report. There has also been an alarming increase in online child abuse.Cyber-criminals are taking advantage of the pandemic by using widespread interest in the subject to trick users into revealing their personal information or clicking on malicious links or attachments and unwittingly downloading malware on their computers. Coronavirus-related email 'phishing' attacks have spiked by over 600 % in Europe since the end of February. Criminals may present themselves as credible government organisations or centres for public health. Other attacks during the pandemic include 'Zoom-bombings', where hackers or trolls hijack a group video call that is being carried out via Zoom.Increased e-commerce and cashless payments also bring on increased risks of cybercrime attacks and cybersecurity breaches. Over 87 % of EU citizens consider cybercrime an important challenge: with payments becoming increasingly cashless, online theft \u2013 of money but also of personal data \u2013 has been on the rise.Some expect that these trends will weaken as confinement starts easing in many countries, and companies such as Zoom take more measures, including end-to-end encryption, to protect their users. WhatsApp has already stated that it has seen a drop of 70 % in 'highly forwarded' messages \u2013 the kind that may spread misinformation about coronavirus.There are also important concerns about privacy and data protection related to the use of digital technology to fight the pandemic. The European consumer association, BEUC, has raised some legal and ethical issues that have been triggered by the digitalisation of healthcare and need to be tackled, among others in terms of data protection and privacy in relation to digital tracing apps, for instance.How digital technology is easing the burden of confinement9From the health crisis point of view, it is unlikely that the Covid-19 testing capacity will be sufficient for exhaustive population-wide testing. In the shorter term, this means that until a vaccine is discovered, authorities need to prioritise who should be tested. For this selection, digital contact tracing is likely to become a core component of governments' Covid-19 lockdown exit strategies. For these to work effectively, large-scale adoption of digital contact-tracing will be necessary at national and international levels. Singapore is one of the countries to apply the most highly digitalised means for fighting the disease, and it is also a front-runner in terms of developing and using a tracing app. Called TraceTogether, this app has been adopted by about 25 % of the population, still far from the 75 % needed for it to be effective. Privacy concerns as well as the speed at which it drains phone batteries have been cited as reasons for its low adoption rate.Different models are emerging globally for collecting and sharing individual location data. Worryingly, EU countries are choosing different solutions. Some, such as Germany, Italy and Austria, are choosing decentralised models, such as that being jointly developed by Google and Apple, while others are choosing their own centralised models (such as the ones developed in France4). Many, such as Spain, remain undecided. In Poland, the government has launched an app that uses geolocation data and facial recognition technology to control those under quarantine, through requesting selfies.These divergences among EU models together with possible low adoption rates pose many challenges to their interoperability and ultimately their effectiveness. In addition, there are also digital divide concerns, as not everybody owns a smartphone that can use these apps, and children as well as elderly people might be excluded as a rule.From a cybersecurity perspective, some experts argue that centralised models pose more risks in case databases get hacked, whereas others argue that a balance should be struck between considerations of privacy and considerations of public health, and that a centralised approach gives more speed and insight to fight the pandemic.The European Commission has published guidelines recommending that tracing solutions should respect the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules. However, in April Hungary took an emergency decision to suspend applying parts of the GDPR in this domain. Many governments outside Europe have used various intrusive measures such as tracking mobile location data, CCTV, and credit-card transaction records, to broadly monitor citizens' activity and to apply penalties and other sanctions on those who are not respecting the quarantines at home.Digital dependencyThe pandemic has further consolidated the dominance of Big Tech companies, such as Amazon, Netflix and YouTube, which have seen their net worth increase manifold as a result of their stock market rebound, given their increased use and role during the pandemic. A similar boost has been witnessed by the world's most popular videoconferencing apps, none of which is European.5 Amazon and Netflix have both increased in value by roughly 30 % this year, while Zoom's value has doubled. For instance, Amazon's market valuation is now about US$1.17 trillion, about the size of the entire Spanish economy. The five Big Tech companies \u2013 Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook \u2013 account for a fifth of the market capitalisation of the entire Standard and Poor's 500 index.These companies continue to gain competitive advantages among other things by means of a mechanism known as the feedback loop (that is, improving their quality and value by using data already at their disposal or revenue generated from business users, such as from targeted online advertising). This concentration of power is making it increasingly difficult for smaller companies, also weakened by the pandemic, to challenge them. In France, over 80 % of start-ups have lost revenue during the crisis. As a result of this general situation, achieving digital sovereignty has emerged as one of the EU's strategic goals.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service10What the EU is doingFostering digital transformation is higher than ever on the EU's political agenda, and has been identified as a priority for unlocking future growth in Europe.The EU will increase its support for digital transformation in the coming years, as illustrated by the proposed 2021-2027 Digital Europe programme, which will be the first-ever funding programme dedicated solely to supporting digital transformation in the EU. Further EU action will be needed, notably to increase infrastructure investment, boost innovation, foster EU digital champions and businesses' digitalisation, reduce existing digital divides, enhance EU cybersecurity capabilities and ensure respect for privacy and data protection. The important role played by digital technology in the coronavirus crisis has further underlined the importance of continued network investment to meet the Commission's Gigabit Society objectives for 2025, in particular through 5G and fibre networks and the fight to bridge the digital divide.Following the surge in internet traffic owing to coronavirus confinement, the Commission has called upon players such as the major platforms, BEREC, telecoms operators and the public to cooperate in order to establish connectivity and open internet across Europe. In addition, the Commission has asked streaming platforms, such as Netflix and YouTube, to offer their streamed content in standard rather than high definition and to cooperate with telecoms operators. Several application providers, such as Netflix, Akamai and YouTube, have agreed to reduce their video streaming quality at peak times in Europe, and some have shifted default settings from high-definition to standard-definition globally.On 8 April, the Commission recommended adopting a common pan-European approach for Covid-19 mobile applications and using anonymised mobility data for contact tracing, to be developed together by Member States and the Commission. On 16 April, the Commission published guidelines on the development of new tracing apps to ensure compliance with EU privacy and personal data protection legislation. The Commission recommended the use of voluntary apps and Bluetooth communication between devices to determine proximity, because this 'appears more precise, and therefore more appropriate, than the use of geolocation data' and because this functionality avoids the possibility of tracking.Likewise, in a resolution adopted on 17 April, the European Parliament stressed that any digital measures against the pandemic must be in full compliance with data protection and privacy legislation. It said that the use of apps should not be obligatory and that they should stop being used once the pandemic is over.During their videoconference of 5 May 2020, EU Member States' telecommunications ministers exchanged views on the use of tracing apps and electronic communication data for the purpose of tackling Covid-19. They also held a broader debate on the role of the digital sector in the post-Covid-19 recovery, including measures to incentivise investment in the deployment of upgraded high-capacity digital infrastructures and 5G.How digital technology is easing the burden of confinement11MAIN REFERENCESPolicy Responses to Coronavirus, OECD website, 2020.Testing for COVID 19: A way to lift confinement restrictions, OECD, May 2020.Stress on networks, the Global Network Resiliency Platform, ITU, March 2020.The impact on spectrum awards of the Covid-19 pandemic, PlumConsulting, April 2020.ENDNOTES1 In a 19 March 2020 joint statement with the European Commission, on how network operators can cope with the increased demand on network capacity, BEREC stated it had set up a special regular reporting mechanism to monitor the internet traffic situation in each Member State in order to be able to respond swiftly to capacity issues.2 However, according to recent academic research, it appears that the EU is not in such a good position compared to the US and some Asian countries in terms of readiness to telework.3 For instance, in countries such as France, Spain, Austria and Portugal, while Sweden has announced its spectrum auction for November 2020.4 France's Stopcovid-19 solution is expected to be mainstreamed in the country as of 2 June. The UK is also launching a centralised Covid-19 tracing app called NXSH.5 Even if Skype is of European origin, none of the most used videoconferencing apps worldwide is from the EU at present.DISCLAIMER AND COPYRIGHTThis document is prepared for, and addressed to, the Members and staff of the European Parliament as background material to assist them in their parliamentary work.

An important part of this debate concerns the market power of large high-tech companies that dominate many online markets. The main factors behind these developments are economies of scale and scope, network externalities, and the rising economic significance of data, which are a highly valuable commodity in an online economy. While being indispensable to the development of potential game changers \u2013 such as artificial intelligence \u2013 data are also a crucial input to many online services, production processes, and logistics \u2013 making it a critical element in the value chain of many different industries.Data-dependent markets are also characterised by a high level of concentration and, according to many experts, high entry barriers relating to access to and ownership of data \u2013 which make it difficult to challenge the incumbent companies. On the other hand, the large players are generally considered to be very productive and innovative. Some studies, however, show that the diffusion of know-how and innovation between the market leaders and the rest of the economy may be affecting competiveness in general.One possible way to correct these shortcomings is to regulate the sharing of data. While the risks of policy-making in this field are generally well-known and centre around the need to protect privacy \u2013 particularly where personal data are involved \u2013 and to prevent the collusive aspects of data sharing, there is currently no global model to follow. The European Union has taken multiple initiatives to unlock data markets through modern, user-centred laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the regulation on the reuse of public sector information. The global thinking seems to gradually favour more prudent oversight of the market, considering its economic heft.In this Briefing Context What makes the digital economy distinct? Economic significance of data Competition issues Data sharingEPRS European Parliamentary Research Service2ContextOne of the fundamental questions facing modern economic policy is whether and how to regulate the digital economy. The two main lines of debate are taxation and competition. Taxation has gathered international attention with some pioneer tax efforts by individual countries, the 2018 EU tax proposals, and the OECD efforts to work out a global solution.1 Competition is hotly debated, and points of view across the world vary. Many argue that regulating the digital economy stifles innovation and reduces its growth potential, while others say that legislation has been lagging behind the dynamic developments and that, in effect, a number of market failures have already materialised. The pivotal issues in this context are the extent to which the current competition policy rules are sufficient to deal with the fast-moving digital economy, and how to modify them so that they can address the new concerns adequately.The global economy has undergone profound and rapid change with the rise of digital technology. This shift is consistent with the general rise of the intangible economy over the past 20 years, attributed mainly to technological progress that enhances the productivity of skills and capital. This technology-based transition towards intangibles could be the main factor behind many major economic trends shaping today's economy, such as income polarisation and reallocation of credit from productive to asset financing.2 This transition has accelerated significantly in recent years. In the last decade alone, the list of the world's largest global companies has changed dramatically. Businesses characterised by ownership of strong fixed capital assets, particularly those active in the oil sector, dominated the world's top firms in 2008. Ten years later, in 2018, the value of the intangible economy had risen to such an extent that the five largest global firms were all technology companies.3Table \u2013 Largest global companies in 2008 and 201820082018RankCompanyFoundedValue (US$ bn)CompanyFoundedValue (US$ bn)1PetroChina1999728Apple19768902Exxon1870492Google19987683General Electric1892358Microsoft19756804China Mobile1997344Amazon19945925ICBC1984336Facebook2004545Source: Visceral Business, 2018.A crucial question is whether the large technology companies exert market power that is significant to the point of being disadvantageous to competition, consumer welfare, and productivity. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) maintains that, while there are differences between the United States and the EU, market power seems to have been increasing in both regions, although this increase is not exclusive to digitally intensive sectors. Empirical research points to the fact that many OECD countries, particularly the US, have experienced a rise in the number of 'superstar firms'. While such firms indicate rising concentration in economic sectors, they are often considered to be highly productive and innovative.It is important to note that both the EU and the US suffer from overall stagnating productivity. One of the factors behind this is the uneven concentration in the economy \u2013 while some firms experience strong productivity gains, mainly thanks to rapid technological progress, others are stagnant andIs data the new oil?3not able to catch up. The rising divide between the pioneering companies and those lagging behind has been identified by the OECD, which concluded that technological diffusion is stalling and dragging down overall productivity. The reasons that make it increasingly difficult for non-leading firms to compete with market leaders are mainly the rising barriers to market entry and the high costs of switching to a knowledge-based economy.Indeed, it is no coincidence that certain digital markets, such as those with strong presence of online platforms, and which have had to face faster and more profound technological changes, are characterised by a disproportionately higher growth in concentration rates.4 This suggests that technological dynamism plays an important role in turning leading firms into dominant superstars. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) talks about the emergence of superstar sectors based on digital innovation.Innovation in many sectors of the digital economy requires high fixed costs but can be reproduced extensively at zero marginal cost, which is what creates increasing returns to scale. Undoubtedly, the rise of platform and knowledge-based superstar firms is currently unmistakable in the digital economy, where only a handful of companies control the largest market share (see Figure 1).There are rising concerns that this trend is the sign of a shift of digital markets towards a 'winner-takes-all' dynamic, where the companies that achieve market leadership, or manage to control a significant share of the market, can tip the market in their favour, becoming very difficult to 'dethrone' and creating a number of issues in the area of market competition, as discussed below.What makes the digital economy distinct?The economic literature recognises some main inherent characteristics of internet-based business models. These models often lead to the development of ecosystems that give incumbents a strong competitive advantage. First, the cost of production of digital services and goods is often disproportionately low considering their large numbers of users. This leads to enormous returns to scale, which, while not exclusive to the digital economy, have a more pronounced effect in this sector, where marginal costs are often low or close to zero.5 Digital firms may also reach economies of scope, where data from one stream are used to generate new services. According to the OECD, these characteristics create a new situation when compared to traditional business models. The lower production costs, the easier penetration of multiple markets, and the higher intensity in knowledge assets make it possible for digital companies to scale up faster, generating rapidly increasing returns to scale. This first-mover advantage can potentially make it harder for new players to enter the market. Digital firms are able to achieve scale without mass. They can have a strong presence in a particular market, to which they supply their digital services, without being physically established in that market.Second, the digital economy is characterised by strong network externalities.6 The more users embrace a given product, service, or technology, the easier and the more attractive it is for newFigure 1 \u2013 Global market share by companySources: W3Counter, GSStatCounter, eMarketer.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service4users also to jump onboard. There are currently two kinds of network effects: (i) direct network effects \u2013 typical of social networks and communication applications and platforms, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, where the new users are attracted by the numbers of existing users, and (ii) indirect network effects \u2013 typical of platforms that facilitate transactions, such as Amazon, and of platforms with an advertisement-based revenue model, such as YouTube. In the latter case, a platform becomes more appealing to one group of users (e.g advertisers) as another group of users (e.g consumers) grows in number. From a competition point of view, these network effects may make it more difficult for a new entrant to compete with an incumbent market leader \u2013 the mere fact of having better quality or a lower price may not be enough to convince the users of an established company to switch to a new platform, even if it is objectively superior.Third, the use and importance of data have risen substantially with the emergence of the digital economy. While becoming increasingly significant for all sorts of commercial purposes, data also play a crucial role in achieving the economies of scale and network externalities discussed above. The technology-assisted use of data may well have been the leading force behind the ongoing digital transformation. As such, the role of data has come to the forefront of the current debate on regulation of the digital economy.Economic significance of dataThe amount of data generated in the constantly evolving digital economy is growing at an increasing pace. In 2016, IBM reportedly noted that 90 % of the data in the world today had been created in the past two years alone. Amounts are bound to increase even faster \u2013 experts estimate that the Global Internet Protocol (IP) traffic, a proxy for data flows, will be twice as big in 2021 as in 2018. Data will become even more important due to the fact that they are being increasingly generated by networked end-user devices and the Internet of Things (IoT). The economy is inevitably moving towards the wider production of new products and services based on general-purpose technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning, and other similar high-performance computer-driven processes whose real utility and value are impossible to estimate today. These technologies all depend on availability and access to data.Data may be the new most valuable asset in the modern economy. As such, they will play an increasingly fundamental role as a parameter of competition, with many consequences for today's businesses. While being indispensable to the development of potential game changers such as AI, data are also a crucial input to many online services, production processes, and logistics \u2013 which in turn makes them a critical element of the value chain of numerous industries. Data can also be used to create innovative business models (usage data and process data may be analysed to enhance servitisation) and entirely new markets (such as fintech). As a result, and perhaps unsurprisingly, the phrase 'data are the new oil' is increasingly heard in discussions on competition in the digital era, particularly since the publication of a widely referenced article by The Economist in 2017.7 A key difference is that, while oil is obviously a finite and non-reusable resource, data can be infinite and reused \u2013 with account taken of ownership and access rights.Information has always had a value in economic activities. However, the IMF singles out two relatively recent technological trends that are essential to explaining the meteoric rise in importance of data \u2013 technological progress and the development of sophisticated analytical techniques. Technological progress has sharply reduced the costs of collecting, storing, and using quantifiable data \u2013 which, due to increasingly digitalised economic and social activities, are constantly being produced. The development of sophisticated analytical techniques has enabled advanced degrees of data processing, which in turn produce greater value from data. The significance of these two factors may be illustrated by the fact that data are central to the highly lucrative business models of the world's largest corporations.According to the OECD, as the volume of data continues to rise, 'data ownership is concentrating, but its overall value remains unknown. International bandwidth usage is increasingly shiftingIs data the new oil?5towards content providers such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, among others'. The ability of many of these large digital firms to asymmetrically acquire and analyse data, including across a wide range of products and markets, raises legitimate competition policy questions. This is particularly valid for enterprises whose central role in data acquisition and analysis may raise significant barriers to entry for other firms.Competition issuesThere are rising concerns regarding competition in data-intensive markets \u2013 the reasons for which are not yet consensual or fully understood. They may stem from the natural structure and characteristics of digital markets, the regulatory barriers to competition, problems associated with the conduct of firms, or a combination of all of these. Some characteristics inherent to the digital economy, such as economies of scale and scope, network externalities, and cost structures, have the potential to create entry barriers. There are indeed signs that competitive intensity may be weakening on a number of digital markets, as indicated by the growth of the mark-ups charged by companies in relation to their costs, and the reduction in the numbers of new players entering the market. High levels of concentration and dominance have already been achieved on a number of digital markets. As the next technological revolution will most likely centre around AI and machine learning, the companies best placed to take advantage of it may well be those that are already large at present, given that data are indispensable for these technologies to thrive. This could create more insurmountable entry barriers. The question therefore is whether data should be managed in a way that ensures adequate competition. Since data can be used by a number of firms simultaneously and can play an important role in firms' competitiveness and opportunities to innovate, the wide dissemination of data and the use of them by the largest possible number of firms could, in principle, increase economic and social welfare.8 Empirical research shows, however, that enterprises may have incentives to hoard data in order to maintain their advantage over potential competitors, decreasing overall welfare.Some experts believe that holding a large pool of user data generated by certain digital platforms confers substantial advantages to established companies. They are thus able to acquire a competitive advantage by means of a mechanism known as a feedback loop, which means improving the quality and value of a firm's products and services either by using data already at its disposal or by using revenue generated from business users, such as from targeted online advertising. These improvements in turn draw users attracted by higher quality and better-targeted products and services, creating a virtuous cycle that makes it hard for small players to challenge large companies. The exclusive ownership of data may therefore lead to weaker competition. Consequently, the benefits from the feedback loop may not be fully shared with customers, whether there is foul play on the part of large companies or not. The OECD notes that 'the dominant platform may not do anything that can be properly qualified as anti-competitive, and yet the feedback loop can reinforce dominance and prevent rival platforms from gaining customers'. Additionally, there are a number of recognised market failures due to data ownership and analysis, such as exploiting consumers' behavioural biases \u2013 consumers not able to choose the best course of action \u2013 and information asymmetry \u2013 consumers not knowing or understanding what data they share.Furthermore, users may be locked into a company if their data cannot be easily transferred, because of the risk of losing it. Because many dominant players in the data economy cover the entire online value chain, they link multiple online markets, combining data and generating valuable datasets that cannot be easily replicated. Such 'ecosystems' may raise barriers to entry if they integrate complementary services without making them inter-operable with alternative offers, given that potential competitors are then forced to duplicate the broad offer. Data also become an important issue when competitors merge, creating larger datasets and significantly increasing their market power. Moreover, data can be used with the intention of excluding competitors, leading to instances of abuse of a dominant position.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service6The OECD sees specific risks related to big data that make the increasing economic returns on data harder to exhaust, prolonging the phase in which businesses grow rapidly. By the time the growth of big data firms starts to slow down, they have already become so big that smaller players find it hard to compete effectively. The cost structure of treating and using information initially involves high sunk costs, followed by close-to-zero marginal costs. Once the system is in place, data algorithms constantly improve it and increase its quality, leading to high economies of scale and scope and facilitating market concentration by dominant firms. Some examples of anti-competitive practices specific to big data are: an online platform granting an enterprise exclusive access to data providing it with an unfair advantage over its competitors, the leveraging of data from one market to achieve market power elsewhere by 'bundling' or 'tying' strategies, and the collusion of firms forming digital cartels that use algorithms with market data.The debate on the competitive implications of data is far from settled, given that the available evidence is often mixed. Opponents of classifying digital champions as monopolies argue that past evidence from similar dynamic technology and innovative markets shows that there is no guarantee that a firm's dominant position today will endure in the future or that the dominance is bad for consumers' welfare. They also maintain that data themselves have no intrinsic value \u2013 only when data can solve specific problems in previously impossible ways do they acquire value \u2013 and that this requires investment, innovation, and the right managerial toolkit. Defenders of the competition policy status quo argue that both network and scale effects ultimately benefit consumers and society at large, for they deliver better and more innovative goods and services that would be impossible to produce without a certain scale. They also argue that entry barriers created by data are weaker than they seem because a) the same data can be used by competitors, b) data lose value quickly, c) cloud services lower costs, and d) high costs of entry exist in many other competitive industries, such as the automotive industry. Furthermore, many companies apparently understand that the short-term benefits of hoarding data are inferior to the long-term benefits of sharing them, despite the legal uncertainties surrounding data sharing. Defenders of large data-based companies conclude that 'any potential harms are more likely to be related to conduct, rather than structure, and these can occur in industries with higher as well as moderate concentration ratios.'9Data sharingA widely debated method to address the competition concerns discussed above is to regulate the sharing of data, and even to make it mandatory in specified cases. As long as privacy and security are safeguarded, sharing data may indeed generate a broader social good. Pooling together the same type of, or complementary, data may enable firms to develop new or improved goods and services, and to base their algorithms on a broader, more meaningful basis. The relatively short history of the digital economy indicates that preventing data portability and inter-operability, which are essential prerequisites for data sharing, creates barriers to entry and limits competition. A recent report prepared for the European Commission by a group of experts suggests that data portability could be imposed on certain dominant incumbent firms, possibly through sectoral legislation, in cases where particularly strong lock-in effects are present. Inter-operability may be enforced through common standards and sector-specific regulations.However, data portability itself may not be the most effective solution to competition concerns stemming from fundamental characteristics of digital markets, whose cost structure often requires strong economies of scale and whose network externalities may continue to prevent consumers from switching between competitors. The extent to which inter-operability standards would weaken these characteristics is unclear. Furthermore, ensuring data portability may be costly, particularly for SMEs. The report for the Commission therefore advises that mandating data inter-operability should (i) be carried out by sectoral legislation, with a focus on situations where data access opens up secondary markets for complementary services, or (ii) be limited to dominant firms to mitigate anti-competitive risks. However, data sharing or pooling has its own limitations and risks. It should neither shut out competitors from the market nor facilitate the exchange of commerciallyIs data the new oil?7sensitive information, such as costs or prices. These limitations reduce the amount of data that is actually shareable \u2013 they need to be limited in scope, aggregated, and anonymised. Furthermore, regulators need to be careful not to create disincentives for enterprises willing to collect and process data, leading them instead to 'free ride' on publicly available data pools.While the risks of policy-making in this field are generally well known and centre around the need to protect privacy \u2013 particularly where personal data are involved \u2013 and preventing the collusive aspects of data sharing, there is currently no global model to follow. It is important to remember that competition policy is not the only determinant of how data should be shared. The interaction among different legal regimes regulating access to data also plays a major role. The IMF advocates an integrated cross-cutting policy which (i) clarifies the distribution of economic returns from data, (ii) encourages user control of data, and considers mandatory data sharing across firms to boost competition and weaken the market power of incumbents, (iii) is based on robust cyber-security, and (iv) prevents international fragmentation in data markets.It is worth mentioning that the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, known as GDPR, sets the global standard for access to data. The importance of the GDPR as a modern policy framework is likely to increase. Its emphasis on data protection and personalised data control creates a regulatory model that puts the user and the generator of data in control, and possibly limits the power of enterprises. However, the emphasis of EU law on data protection has also brought to public attention the regulation's possible wide-ranging impact on the economy. GDPR critics maintain that it may even undermine innovation or become a quasi-tax on digital technologies. However, according to International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the international regulatory body, the effects of the GDPR on business models are more likely to lead to positive effects, tackling monopolistic structures and lock-ins and promoting consumer trust in digital markets.The European Union has taken a number of important steps to actively open up its data markets, including laws that enable the reuse of public and publicly funded data and that address the fragmentation of markets along national lines (Regulation on free flow of data). As a result, the subtle balance between safeguarding public interest and guaranteeing framework conditions conducive to sound competition and innovation seems to have been maintained. However, effective oversight of data markets by the Commission is likely to continue to be necessary. The European Commission will be better equipped to monitor digital markets thanks to dedicated funding under the Single Market Programme, which will finance new IT tools and expertise. Recent developments in the United States, where Congress has begun to question the high-tech sector's market power and its influence on competition, seem to confirm the need for more careful scrutiny on the part of the Commission.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service8MAIN REFERENCESAntitrust and Big Tech, Congressional Research Service, September 2019.Competition Policy for the Digital Era, European Commission, 2019.Big data \u2013 Bringing the competition policy to the digital era, OECD, October 2016.The Economics and Implications of Data \u2013 An Integrated Perspective, IMF, 2019.The economics of ownership, access and trade in digital data, Digital Economy Working Paper, Joint Research Centre, European Commission, 2017.ENDNOTES1 For more details, see EPRS briefings on digital services tax and taxation of significant digital presence.2 Income polarisation is a process of concentration of income in two groups \u2013 high and low income groups. This usually means that 'the rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer,' leading to a squeezing out of the middle-income group. In this particular context it may mean that, as intangible assets become more productive, innovators gain a rising income share and accumulate savings, leading to increased house prices and inequality in the economy.3 Taking into account the top 10 companies, half of the largest firms were oil companies in 2008, while in 2018 seven out of 10 were technology companies.4 In its 2016 communication, the Commission identified a number of characteristics common to online platforms: 'they have the ability to create and shape new markets, to challenge traditional ones, and to organise new forms of participation or conducting business based on collecting, processing, and editing large amounts of data; they operate in multisided markets but with varying degrees of control over direct interactions between groups of users; they benefit from 'network effects', where, broadly speaking, the value of the service increases with the number of users; they often rely on information and communications technologies to reach their users, instantly and effortlessly; they play a key role in digital value creation, notably by capturing significant value (including through data accumulation), facilitating new business ventures, and creating new strategic dependencies.'5 Marginal costs are a change in total production costs generated by producing one additional unit of goods or services.6 Network externality is a notion that explains that a demand for a given product or service is related to the demand of other consumers purchasing that product or using that service. In other words, the buying patterns of customers are influenced by other users of a product or service.7 The phrase is widely attributed to British mathematician Clive Humby, who used it in 2006.8 Caveats to this include privacy concerns and risks of weakening incentives for firms to invest in gathering data if they assume that the data will be available for free elsewhere.9 As shown by the cases where the Commission challenged Google, abuses of dominant position based on data and size do occur. Those cases also show that digital markets are so dynamic that ex-post intervention by competition authorities should happen when the company is already too big to be effectively challenged by the other smaller firms.DISCLAIMER AND COPYRIGHTThis document is prepared for, and addressed to, the Members and staff of the European Parliament as background material to assist them in their parliamentary work.

For several banks, pre-crisis profitability levels were boosted by high leverage, reliance on affordable wholesale funding and, in some cases, elevated risk-taking in order to generate high revenues. Changes in banks\u2019 behaviour and in the regulatory framework have made some of the (previously) most profitable business strategies less viable. The weak macroeconomic conditions also have contributed to deteriorating performances since the crisis. As a result, in terms of return on equity (RoE) and return on assets (RoA), euro area banks have compared unfavourably to their international peers since the global financial crisis (Fig. 1). Lower profitability of listed banks had translated into below-par price-to-book value, meaning that current and expected bank returns are below stockholders\u2019 expectations (Fig. 2).Prolonged scarce profitability is indeed relevant from a financial stability perspective because it reduces banks\u2019 ability to generate capital internally through retained earnings and give incentives to excessive risk taking. As such, scarce bank profitability has become a major concern for European supervisors (Const\u00e2ncio, 2017; de Guindos, 2019).Against this background, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) has recently carried out a 2-year review on profitability drivers at significant institutions (SIs) in the euro area; banks\u2019 profitability and business models have been assessed by examining several dimensions based of the contribution to net income (ECB, 2019). An important area of assessment has been the bank\u2019s strategy. Strategy is relevant because the possibility to return to sustainable profits will depend on the ability to adapt business mix to a diverse set of external factors that include new regulatory requirements, unconventional monetary policies, increased competition from nonbanks financial intermediaries and disruption from new technologies. These factors have made it difficult for banks to continue operating efficiently with their existing business models.The main message of the SSM review is that each bank is different and there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d strategy for business model adjustment. While some of the post-crisis trends have certainly contributed to making banks safer (e.g , reduced leverage and organizational complexity, shift to stable funding), the results presented highlight that, in the current context, there is not necessarily one specific business model that is preferable per se. It follows that among possible strategies to enhance profitability (i.e , income diversification, shift to fee income, cost optimization, and risk reduction), there is no better option than others. Yet, independently on the strategy, banks need good strategic steering and risk management capabilities to adjust their business model to changes in their operating environment.Cyclical challenges to profitability are in some cases exacerbated by structural factors, such as overcapacity in certain banking markets. Overcapacity has several dimensions requiring interventions at a twofold level, as both market forces and policy makers need to take actions.More generally, given the multiple challenges faced by banks, firm-specific actions to enhance profitability needs to be accompanied by incisive policy makers\u2019 initiatives. In this last respect, it is important to fix some structural inefficiencies at national and supra-national level in order to promote the most fertile environment for banks to operate. These concerted actions would help to reduce the gap between banks\u2019 RoE and cost-of-equity. This needs to be closed not only by requiring banks to adjust RoE. Strengthening the institutional framework would help foster investors\u2019 confidence and possibly realign their risk/return appetite to more viable levels of profitability.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 9AimThe goal of the paper is to comment on the outcome of the assessment on profitability and business models carried out by the SSM in 2016-2018. First, we summarise the findings of the assessment. Second, we review the main related literature on drivers of bank profitability. We focus on most recent empirical studies on European banks. Third, we compare the outcome of the SSM assessment to the main findings of reviewed studies. Finally, we critically comment on supervisory responses, by highlighting some controversial issues emerged from our analysis.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit10 PE 634.364THE SSM THEMATIC REVIEW ON BUSINESS MODELS AND DRIVERS OF PROFITABILITY1.1 Main objectives and contentsIn 2016 European banking supervision launched a thematic review for the in-depth assessment of the business models and profitability drivers of SIs in the euro area. The review took on a micro perspective, with the bank-level analysis being the main pillar.Banks\u2019 business models and profitability drivers are a key priority for European banking supervision. Profitable banks can generate capital internally and hold adequate buffers, while maintaining a reasonable risk appetite in order to keep on lending to the real economy. However, in the current environment, euro area banks\u2019 profitability is not only challenged by low interest rates and high provisioning, but also by structural factors, such as overcapacity, tougher competition from non-banks, increasing customer demand for digital services as well as new regulatory requirements.The thematic review addresses banks\u2019 profitability drivers at the firm level and across business models. Spanning two years, it had several objectives: assessing banks\u2019 ability to mitigate weaknesses in their business models; monitoring how weak profitability impacts on banks\u2019 behaviour; enriching horizontal analysis, in particular by pooling the insights gained by the joint supervisory teams (JSTs) and harmonising their follow-up across banks to facilitate peer comparison. Results of the individual bank-level analysis fed into the 2018 SREP (Element 1, business model assessment).To achieve the above mentioned goals, the review entailed the analysis of the three following areas:\u2022 sustainability of net income by assessing the main sources of revenues and costs (interest income, fees and commissions, trading income, operational costs, cost of risk)\u2022 quality of the framework to steer profitability (e.g , cost analysis / cost allocation and loan pricing)\u2022 quality of strategic aspects, such as governance, feasibility and consistency of the strategy, and impact of the strategy on the risk profile.Figure 3 illustrates the timeline of the two-year review.1.2 Main results1.2.1 Overview of profitability (main facts)The supervisory review documents that SSM banks\u2019 profits (indicated in term of RoE and RoA) remain largely below those of US banks and anyway lower than pre-crisis level in the euro area. There are structural and cyclical factors at the micro and macro level behind this evidence that we summarize as follows:\u2022 Despite the decline at many banks in recent years, the aggregate stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) remain far too high by international standards (cost of risk remains high).\u2022 Despite significant shrinkage, excess capacity persist, posing a burden on cost structures (operational costs remain high).\u2022 The accommodative monetary policy, while alleviating the cost of funding, also determined net interest margin compression. However, (i) loan growth compensated for most of margin compression; and (ii) while reduced at aggregate level, net interest income (NII) has increasedWhat are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 11for half of SSM banks in the last three years. In terms of business models, retail lenders suffered the most over the same time span.\u2022 Consolidation process and competition have put pressure on revenues. Consolidation however is not generalized as some jurisdictions (namely, Italy, Germany and Austria) remain fragmented. At the same time, non-banks (i.e , Fin-Tech firms) have gained importance, starting their activity in the payments industry. In perspective, competition from Fin-techs may be disruptive for the banking industry as they may extend their activities into the lending business.\u2022 Profitability conditions vary across banks, business models, and countries. Overall, nearly 50% of reviewed SIs improved both NII and their net fee and commission income (NFCI); a much smaller percentage (nearly 7%) could raise their core banking revenues by replacing NII with fees/commission. Yet, the remaining portion of review SIs were unable to compensate reduced interest income with other sources of revenues. In terms of business models, largest and more universal banks were in a more comfortable positions, being able to generate revenues from asset management and greater interaction with financial markets. On the other hand, retail lenders, regardless of higher fees, were not able to compensate for their large decline over the last three years.\u2022 The analysis of top tiers banks (those with RoE and RoA above the sample average) confirms the heterogeneity in terms of business models, countries of origins and strategies; 22 banks located in 12 countries outperformed their peers achieving an average RoE of 6-15%; such an achievement was the result of either cost savings or revenue generation.\u2022 While enhancing cost efficiency (and hence, reducing the cost-to-income ratio) is a desirable objective, hasty cost-cutting does not seem to be the best strategy, as this may undermine banks\u2019 ability to generate profits or raise opportunities in the future.\u2022 Regardless of the improved soundness, reduced riskiness and overall tighter regulatory regime, many banks do not generate sufficient earnings to cover their cost of capital.1.2.2 Main criticismThe ECB\u2019s review identified some criticisms in banks\u2019 strategic steering profitability. The ability to steer profitability in the long term was examined by reviewing the following \u201careas\u201d classified by source of revenues or expenses: NII, NFCI, net trading income, operational costs, loan pricing and strategy. For each area, the JSTs examined drivers and future developments. The main criticisms are summarized below:\u2022 NII and NFCI: need for sensitivity and scenario analysis of different profitability areas to assess expected volumes and margin across business lines and countries. It emerged from the analysis that, e.g , the low interest rate environment allowed banks to reduce the cost of funding. This sort of cost savings cannot be replicated for long, pointing to the importance of finding alternative strategies based on boosting income sources.\u2022 Cost structure: the overall assessment is positive and cost management and control process seem to be effective at most of reviewed banks. Some room of manoeuvre remains. Banks are expected to produce more analytical breakdown of cost structure across business lines and distribution channels, and to provide a more precise cost allocation among business areas and the corporate centre. Banks are also expected to better assess the consequences of cost-cutting strategies on income generation. Such improvement should promote better (more informed) decision at business line level.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit12 PE 634.364\u2022 Loan pricing: enhancing this area is priority for several banks. Comprehensive pricing model with minimum pricing threshold, where prices are set after taking into account the main sources of expenses associated to that loan (cost of funding and risk, operational cost, cost of capital absorbed by the loan). For banks adopting price taking approaches, a profitability analysis is needed. More generally, banks need to take more informed decision as for which loans to grant, how to price them properly, and how to monitor exceptions.\u2022 Strategy: the main issues encountered in this area relates to the assumptions underlying banks\u2019 strategic goals in the medium term. Specifically, banks are expected to challenge these assumptions through sensitivity analysis and stress tests. A related issue is that risk management function is only partially involved in the formulation of the strategy (this occurs in 50% of the reviewed banks). Finally, these goals should be formalized into a higher number and more granular targeted key performance indicators.Generally, deficiencies are exacerbated in large and complex organizations where it is more difficult to reconcile independence of subsidiaries with a unitary view at the group level. More accurate flow of information (e.g , on loan pricing mechanism) from subsidiaries to group control is needed. By the same token, best performing banks seems to have better strategic steering capabilities in basically all areas under analysis.1.2.3 Banks\u2019 responsesIn terms of banks\u2019 responses to profitability challenges, the main conclusions are the following.First, there is not \u201cone-fits-all-approach\u201d to profitability, as discrepancies emerge among reviewed banks. The 22 top-performer banks showed different approaches to costs and income. Some were better able to manage costs, others to generate revenues, and a third group to balance between the strategies of revenue generation and cost control.Second, go forward strategies reflect banks\u2019 current situation: weaker banks focus on cost control and NPLs, while stronger banks are more oriented to business and capital growth.In terms of lines of business to develop, lending expansion is a more likely growth strategy for top and medium performers. A smaller share of banks plan to expand their business in new market or to enhance revenue diversification through cross-selling. Less profitable banks are the least likely to pursuit this strategy in the future, being more focused on cost optimization (including on funding costs). For some banks, expansion plans may entail internationalization strategies.Digitalization appears to be top priority for most if not all banks, although differences emerge as for how pervasive within the organization digitalization will be. While IT budgets has grown by more than 20% in the last 5 years, and almost all banks aim to strengthen their digital (on-line and app-based) distribution channels, only a few of them aim to take advantage of IT innovation for their back-end system and processes.1.2.4 Supervisors\u2019 main concernsA first concern outlined by supervisors after the review, deals with execution risk and potentially optimistic assumptions behind banks\u2019 strategy: How will the strategy react if assumptions do not verify in practice?Execution risk pertain nearly 30% of reviewed banks according to the JSTs. In these cases, potential macro-economic or regulatory shocks are not taken into account properly, and hence, supervisors are following up by asking for more correct sensitivity and downturn scenario analyses.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 13A second concern deals with the level of increased risk taking implicit in growth strategies, especially if related to lending. Concerns in this respect refer to the risk of credit standard relaxation, more aggressive loan pricing, or the supply of new products to reach growth targets.Other potential sources of risk arising from banks strategy are operation risk from digitalization and the impact of cost optimization.What is important to underline, is that supervisors do not consider these concerns as worrying per se but only if banks do not show good strategic steering and risk management capabilities.On the other hand, supervisors will pay close attention on forward-looking sustainability of profitability, as there are signs of pressure to reach for yield and funding strategies. Specifically, trend on composition of loans and deposits show that asset-liability maturity mismatching is increasing, which may pose some threats on banks\u2019 net profits in a scenario of interest rate normalization.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit14 PE 634.364WHAT THE LITERATURE TELLS US ABOUT DETERMINANTS OF BANK PROFITABILITYA major reason why bank profitability has received increasing attention by European policy makers in the recent past (e.g , Const\u00e2ncio, 2017; de Guindos, 2019) is because of the negative externalities of prolonged low profits. Specifically, while in principle low profitability indicates functioning competition in the industry, or low-risk business strategy, in practice what it worries supervisors most are its potential detrimental effects on financial system stability and credit supply. Low profitability influences banks\u2019 ability to accumulate capital internally through retained earnings, thus potentially hampering credit supply. It also may give incentive to excessive risk taking that depends on the level of profit margin and bank charter value. With small margins and hence, low charter value, there is incentive to take more risk, as cost of funding will not be paid in the event of a failure, while a higher income will be earned in the event of success (Jensen and Meckling, 1976).A vast strand of theoretical and empirical literature has investigated the main drivers of bank profitability (preferably proxied by RoE or RoA), by focusing on either micro (bank specific) determinants or macro factors. Among the latter, monetary policy measures have traditionally played a key role.Early studies on the impact of monetary policy on bank profitability document the existence of a positive correlation between interest rates and bank interest margins. This positive association is interpreted as a natural consequence of banks\u2019 maturity transformation activities (e.g , Flannery, 1981). The most immediate effect of a reduction in interest rate is to boost profitability, due to reduced funding cost, higher asset and collateral value, and lower default risk on the new or repriced loans.More recently, the accommodative monetary policy cycle that followed the financial crisis has stimulated an intense debate on the potential benefits and side effects of a prolonged low interest rate environment (LIRE).1Measuring the role played by recent accommodative policy measures on banks\u2019 profits is not an easy task, as several components of bank profitability are affected asymmetrically by reduced interest rates. Changes in interest rates have both a price and quantity effect, affecting interest margin and interest income volume (through the impact on the aggregate credit demand) in an opposite way. To explain the mechanism, net margin reduction can be offset by larger intermediation volumes triggered by increased credit demand. Moreover, reduced margins on maturity transformation activities may be offset by enhanced borrower creditworthiness leading to lower loan loss provisions.In a recent work on euro area banks, Altavilla et al. (2018) document these types of offsetting mechanisms. They find that a reduction in interest rate (their proxy for conventional monetary policy) and a flattening in the yield curve (to proxy for unconventional policy) is associated to reduced profitability (RoA). They also document however that results weaken, and significance evidence of the nexus disappears, when controlling for the expected economic growth and forward looking borrower credit risk. The logic behind this finding result is that better expected macro-economic outlook and lower expected credit risk (both stimulated by accommodative policies) tend to boost credit demand1 See Carletti and Ferrero (2017) for a comprehensive analysis of the effect of LIRE in different scenarios.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 15and enhance borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness, with beneficial effect in banks\u2019 performance.2 When including bank characteristics, in line with previous studies (e.g , Detragiache et al., 2018), asset quality deterioration and reduced cost efficiency are associated with lower profitability. Conversely, they find that the reaction to accommodative monetary policies are more positive in relative terms for banks with lower cost-to-income and NPL ratios. When focusing on the components of bank profitability (NII, non interest income and provisions), in line with other studies (Claessens, 2018 among others) they find that NII decrease when interest rates drop. However, such a decrease is not sufficient to negatively affect bank profitability, which may benefit from reduced provisions. In the same vein, Lopez et al. (2019) find that banks suffer losses under low rates on net interest margins, but compensate through gains in non-interest income stemming from \u201cother income\u201d sources, such as capital gains on securities.Keeping interest rates low for long has controversial effects on bank profitability. Specifically, the net benefits of accommodative monetary policies may be declining over time (Alessandri and Nelson, 2015; Borio et al., 2017), thus determining negative consequences on bank profits (Claessens et al, 2018). One mechanism is that the positive effects on repricing securities held by banks at lower interest rates are over time increasingly offset by the negative impact on net interest margins (Brunnermeier and Koby, 2019).Focusing on micro-drivers, profitability seems largely explained by bank characteristics, business models and, to lower extent, bank location (Detragiache et al., 2018). Within each business models, maturity structure of asset and liabilities and degree of maturity transformation play a role (Altavilla et al., 2019). On the liability side, better post crisis performance is associated to larger decline in the share of wholesale funds, although the mechanism is not clear. Funding structure is important as it can either mitigate or exacerbate the effect of monetary policy easing. Taken to the extreme, easing policy measures may favor risk taking at high-deposit banks through an additional mechanism (Heider et al, 2019). When the policy rate becomes negative, greater reliance on deposits (relative to market-based debt), may have an adverse effect on bank net worth. This adverse effect on bank net worth explains why banks with more deposits should lend less and take on more risk once the policy rate becomes negative. Lopez et al. (2019) also document that the move into negative interest rates induces small and high-deposit banks to shift their assets away from cash and increase lending activity.Connection between bank size, scale economies and profitability is also under discussion. While early empirical studies concluded that scale economies can only be realised up to a relatively small bank size (Benston et al., 1982), more recent analysis shows that even large banks can improve their performance by achieving remarkable economies of scale (see GCEE, 2019, and literature therein). This may be the result of a changing environment where fixed costs play a more important role (Mester, 2010; Laeven et al., 2016).To some extent, technological changes may have increased the optimal scale of banks (ESRB, 2014). Focusing on the euro area, empirical evidence suggests that banks across all size categories also operate on an inefficient scale and generally seem to support the existence of economies of scale for all size categories and across countries (Andreeva et al., 2019).Improving operational efficiency could be impeded by structural features of the banking market, e.g, overcapacity in the industry. There are different concepts and metrics of overcapacities. Gard\u00f3 and Klaus (2019), by reconciling various strands of literature, illustrate overcapacities along three dimensions: the degree of bank intermediation that exceeds real economic demand (\u201cthe economy is over-financed\u201d); the presence of a large number of banks with small market shares making competition2 The authors find that expected GDP growth and expected default frequency ar the main macro factors explaining bank profitability, both statistically and economically.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit16 PE 634.364too fierce (\u201cthe market is over-banked\u201d); the oversized physical banking infrastructure, at the lower end of the technology frontier (\u201ccustomers are over-serviced\u201d). Table 1 provides an overview of the dimensions of overcapacities and underlying variables, while Figure 4 shows the (over)capacity of the euro banking system (as a combination of the 12 sub-indicators reported in Table 1), vis-\u00e0-vis other economies. Zero denotes an average level of capacity, and positive/negative readings denote more/less capacity than in an average banking system. It emerges an issue of overcapacity in the euro area banking market, which manifests itself mainly with an excess of physical banking infrastructure and an excess number of competitors.The level of competition is a relevant factor to explain bank profitability, for example because higher competition puts pressure on bank margins. Price competition may affect the efficiency of the allocative process, with most banks operating as price takers and only those with larger market share being able to set prices efficiently, so as to cover the various costs associated to lending and remunerate the intermediation activity (Gard\u00f3 and Klaus, 2019).The intensity of competition is affected both by new market participants entering the market and weak banks not exiting. Some of the existing competitors in the euro area operate under a non-profit charter, which reduces the market-based incentives to tackle overcapacity (Andreeva et al. 2019). Among non-bank competitors, challenges are generated by Fin-Tech and Big-Tech firms.3 With a focus on Fin-Tech lenders in the US, Buchak et al. (2018) document that traditional deposit-taking banks facing increased capital and regulatory burden retreated from residential mortgage lending, and that shadow banks stepped into this gap. A reallocation to lightly regulated nonbanks has also occurred in the US corporate loan market. This reallocation had important spillovers: during the 2008 crisis, loans funded by nonbanks with fragile liabilities were less likely to be rolled over and experienced greater price volatility (Irani et al., 2018).To summarize the main findings above, bank profitability is affected by macro and micro factors. Among bank specific determinants, asset quality and cost efficiency play a predominant role. Macro factors are less relevant and evidence is not always consistent across studies. As for the role played by recent accommodative policy measures, short-term rate reduction does not have produced (or not produced yet) statistically significant effects on bank net income, although it has determined some opposite effects on its components (namely, net interest income and provisions). This may explain the small impact of short-term rate reduction on net income. Studies on the long-term effect of LIRE are more controversial. One reason is that direct (negative) effects on bank balance sheet might be offset by indirect (more benign) effects that derive from improved macro conditions. Some of these effects can be either amplified or mitigated depending on bank business models. Under certain conditions (negative interest rates that banks will not pass on to their depositors), for example, a remarkable reliance on core deposits may be detrimental to bank performance and also lead to excessive risk taking. Moreover, even within the same business model, a different intensity asset-liability composition and maturity transformation can expose otherwise similar banks to different risks. Structural features of the banking industry are also relevant. Overcapacity in the industry, in particular, threatens bank performance in several manners and influences the way bank business models will evolve in the future.3 See Petralia et al. (2019) for a comprehensive analysis of competition from Fin-Tech and Big-Tech in the banking industry.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 17RECONCILING LITERATURE FINDINGS AND SUPERVISORY REVIEW RESULTS3.1 Are results comparable and consistent?The aim of this section is to understand whether and to which extent the evidence emerged from the review is in line with the findings from academic studies on bank profitability.We look at the review outcome through the lenses of the results emerged from the above mentioned studies. The following points emerge:\u2022 Generally speaking, requiring banks to put efforts in solving NPL issue and optimizing cost structure is consistent with empirical findings showing that poor asset quality and cost inefficiency are the most relevant bank specific factors associated with low profitability.\u2022 Limited empirical evidence on the impact of low interest rates on banks\u2019 NII is consistent with the conclusion in the review that several banks have undertaken compensation strategies, i.e , by expanding lending volumes to offset the interest margin reduction effects.\u2022 Effective revenue diversification by increasing (or switching to) fees and commissions is a viable strategy only for limited banks (mainly universal banks operating in the asset management industry). The limited empirical evidence on the positive role played by non-interest income to the overall profitability is consistent with this outcome.\u2022 Differences in business models and asset - liabilities composition are remarkable and may explain heterogeneous reaction to the same factors (including monetary policy actions). Assessing and challenging banks\u2019 ability to steer profitability and strategy to, e.g , changes in environment conditions is therefore relevant also in light of the empirical findings. This also calls into question the quality of risk management and its involvement in the formulation of the strategy (e.g , asset-liability management techniques to manage interest risk stemming from funding structure and maturity mismatching).\u2022 Some studies point to potential excessive risk taking favoured by LIRE also at smaller banks with a large base of traditional funding. Supervisors have indeed identified signs of pressure to reach for yield stemming from bank\u2019s strategies.\u2022 Market concentration is not uniform across euro area countries, as some markets remain fragmented. Encouraging consolidation in domestic as well as foreign markets may be desirable to some extent. Contrary to prior studies, recent empirical evidence shows that banks can still exploit economies of scale, because, for example, large IT investments entail remarkable fixed costs. This represents yet another incentive for industry consolidation that, however, has to be stimulated having in mind the numerous implications of overcapacity in the industry. The emergence of too-big-too fail problems is an example of side effects associated with bank consolidation via M&amp;A.\u2022 More generally, overcapacity is a multifaceted issue that not only affects single banks\u2019 performance, but also has implications on growth, financial stability, and social welfare. Supervisory expectations on more efficient loan pricing are consistent with some of the issues raised by overcapacities, i.e , excessive price competition.3.2 Are supervisory expectations conclusive and exhaustive?In this section we provide comments on supervisory responses. We aim to shed lights on aspects that may deserve closer analysis and/or more incisive actions from supervisors and policy makers.One point that emerges from the review is that there is no one-size-fits all approach to profitability even among similar banks. Top performers are diverse by size, business model, and country of origin. The idiosyncratic component is therefore an important factor explaining differences among banks\u2019IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit18 PE 634.364performance. Not surprisingly, in light of this across-banks and within-business-model heterogeneity, even among top performers the level of profitability varies remarkably (with an average RoE ranging from 6 to 15%).Nevertheless, despite the progress made, bank profitability remains lower than pre-crisis years and below that of international peers. A corollary is that a large share of euro area banks is not delivering the returns required by investors i.e , for listed banks, the book-to-value ratio is below one, indicating that those banks are de facto destroying value.Against this background, two questions need to be addressed: Which level of profitability is desirable from a financial stability perspective? How sustainable this will be in the medium-term?\u2022 What is the viable level of bank profitability. Comparing bank profitability in the pre-post crisis years is an interesting exercise that may not be conceptually correct due to the profound changes occurred in the industry since then. It is well known that in the pre-crisis years banks had a more aggressive risk-return profile, were more leveraged, and regulatory constraints were less binding. In addition, the macroeconomic scenario was different, with interest rates being positive and economic growth being sustained. Realistic medium-term RoE should acknowledge these facts and the current gap between cost of equity and RoE could be closed not only by the RoE components but also via reduced expected returns.\u2022 How to reach sustainable profitability. Progress made by banks over the last three years are not necessarily replicable in the following years, especially for weakest firms.o Enhancing return via cross-selling may be not sustainable for long, as a certain number of current customers may have been already saturated. Putting pressure on diversification and fee generating may also incentivize traditional lenders with limited presence in the asset management industry to gain fees on traditional lending and supply of payment services by charging clients on basic operations and products that in the past were provided for free. This attitude can undermine the bank-client relationship to an extent that is unpredictable. However, such a shift towards different sources of income is likely to be gradual and is also dependent on the rate of development of capital markets as well as on competition both within and from outside the banking sector (e.g from Fin-Tech companies). To raise opportunities emerging from capital market and exploiting complementarities, enhancing integration across capital markets becomes crucial.o An important profitability driver in recent years was lower provisioning, reflecting the ongoing reduction in NPLs and better economic conditions. However, historical data suggest that impairments are now at a level where there is little room for further improvement (ECB, 2019b). In the coming years, banks will no longer be able to rely on lower impairment levels to improve profitability. On the contrary, recent economic developments and higher risk taking in the lending business suggest that it may be prudent for them to have higher provisions. By their nature, impairments are volatile, and NPLs disposal generating large one-off charges can change the picture.o Achieving cost efficiency is important and a further shift away from physical branches to digital banking may reoffer a permanent cost-saving opportunity for banks. It remains however that often banks are reluctant to cut down the branch network, because this is a costly strategy requiring large investments and entailing specific, new risks as well as organizational and governance challenges that not all banks are able or willing to face (Barbagallo, 2019). Besides, there are structural differences at country level that may slow down banks progress in this area, as, e.g , local labour laws and the strength of employment protection, or the speed of digital transformation that depends on degree of IT sophistication (Andersson et al., 2018).What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 193.3 Supervisory incentives and banks\u2019 behaviourA further consideration deals with the incentive mechanisms that supervisors aim to provide to banks. It is clear that banks are facing a deep transformation. While several business models exist, it remains that the uniqueness of banks, their specialness as information providers rely on the traditional model of taking deposits and making loans. This paradigm entails risk taking as well as maturity, liquidity and risk transformation. Will this model survive? Do supervisors want it to survive?Addressing these questions is important in light of the fact that some supervisory actions appear to some extent contradictory if considered against the goal of preserving the traditional function provided by banks within the economy.In fact, the system of constraints and monitoring tools to comply with is as such that some banks may be reluctant to undertake actions or seize business opportunities, if these entail closer scrutiny or increased requirements. Correctly, the review on profitability attributes great importance to banks\u2019 ability to steer strategy in a complex and mutable environment. However, anecdotal evidence points to the fact that increasing compliance duties may deviate senior managers from making strategical planning (Bruno and Carletti, 2019). The ECB also is aware of the fact that demanding regulation and supervision may not only challenge banks\u2019 profitability, but also impose risks \u201csuch as banks failing to adapt on time or postponing strategic decisions or investments\u201d (ECB, 2019c). We expand on some of these potential unintended consequences.\u2022 While excessive risk taking is undesirable per se, requirements curbing risk taking behaviour have some potential drawbacks. For example, they may provide the distorted incentives of reducing exposures to counterparties that, in the past, were traditionally financed by banks. In this respect, recent evidence shows that banks have stepped back from medium to sized enterprises with longer term financial needs, while private debt funds have emerged to fill the gap, by providing customised and longer-term facilities.4 Or, banks might have little incentives to provide funds to \u201cunlikely to pay\u201d borrowers, as new funds would mechanically increase the stock of NPLs, even if providing fresh resources might be the proper strategy to favour the recovery of the troubled borrowers (Bruno and Carletti, 2019). Similarly, the emergence of non-bank transaction service providers with extended financial resources, large availability of customer-based information and technology to treat this information effectively and efficiently, represent a concrete threat to banks, especially in consideration of the fact that these new lenders operate under limited regulatory pressure. Similar threats may emerge from non-bank, lightly regulated lenders in other segment of the industry, including corporate lending. The extent to which the banking business would remain special is therefore hard to say.\u2022 Many of the criticisms that emerged from the review are accentuated by overcapacities issues. Yet, there are different dimensions of overcapacity (i.e , size, competition, and infrastructure) requiring a multi-layered approach where both individual banks and policymakers are required to play a role. For example, banks may find it difficult to consolidate cross border due to the uncertainty of the authorization process, or because they are afraid that the process will lead4 Banks have curtailed lending to middle market companies following decades of consolidation in the sector and in response to higher capital charges. Nonbank asset managers are filling the void with direct senior loans to middle market companies that have offered investors both higher yield and lower default risk in exchange for illiquidity. Davis et al. (2018).IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit20 PE 634.364to excessive capital raise, thus reducing the potential savings of consolidation.5 National rules, e.g related to liquidity and capital requirements for subsidiaries, may also act as a disincentive to cross-border consolidation. On the contrary, in order to be efficient, cross-border banks need to conduct liquidity and capital management at the consolidated level, and to face as few national options as possible (Andreeva et al., 2019). Market exit is another option to mitigate overcapacities issues, an option, however, that is taken into consideration with great caution due to the potential negative externalities of bank failures for financial and economic stability. Strengthening the institutional framework of banking resolution is important to make this option viable.To summarize, in order for senior managers to adjust their strategy promptly and effectively, unnecessary requirements should be clearly avoided. Moreover, it is important that supervisors recognise and manage the \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 of their actions. A way to do so is by designing an incentive mechanism that rewards good behaviours in a transparent and predictable way. This would encourage banks to take certain strategic initiatives, although costly. It is also important that policy makers face the overcapacity problems in the industry more fiercely.More generally, it is important to complement banks\u2019 actions with additional initiatives at the institutional level in order to strengthen the environment where banks operate. The pace of adjustments is likely to vary across banks and countries, but it can be accelerated with authorities playing a more active role in addressing structural inefficiencies at the institutional level. Banks\u2019 efforts to adjust business models along the avenues depicted above will be facilitated if a single deposit insurance scheme were established, the capital market union advanced, and non-harmonised national options were removed. Ultimately, the euro area economy needs banks that are large and efficient enough to operate within a pan-European market, but small enough to be resolved with the resources of the Single Resolution Fund. This would help exploit the full benefits of the banking union and improve the trade-off between financial stability and economic efficiency (Andersson et al., 2018).5 Anecdotal evidence and qualitative research is instead more conclusive and report that some aspects of the current supervisory approach could create unnecessary obstacles to the emergence of pan-European banks (Shoenmaker and V\u00e9ron, 2016). In a survey carried out by the EBA, banks find that the cost and riskiness of M&amp;A are the main obstacles to initiate such transactions (EBA, 2018).What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.364 21CONCLUSIONSEuropean banks have suffered from prolonged scarce profitability. This is relevant from a financial stability perspective because scarce profitability reduces banks\u2019 ability to generate additional capital and give incentives to excessive risk taking. To understand banks\u2019 current and prospective position in this respect, the SSM carried out in 2016-2018 a review on drivers of profitability and business models at significant institutions in the euro area. Profitability and business models have been assessed by examining several dimensions based of the main components (revenues and expenses) of net income.The main conclusion of the SSM review is that there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d strategy to achieve viable profitability, this reflecting the cross-sectional heterogeneity of reviewed banks. Independently on the strategy, however, banks with above average profitability were those with good governance, strategic steering and risk management capabilities.Indeed, banks in the euro are have been facing multiple challenges, ranging from high NPLs, a prolonged low interest rate environment, and increased competition from non-bank firms that are expanding in the most traditional banking businesses.Banks have already taken actions to enhance profitability via either reducing cost or enhancing revenues, but the room for manoeuvre in the future does not seem to be ample. Supervisors and policy makers can take further initiatives to fix some structural inefficiencies and provide better conditions for banks to enhance profitability.These concerted actions would help to reduce the gap between banks\u2019 RoE and cost-of-equity. This needs to be closed not only by requiring banks to adjust RoE but also by fostering investors\u2019 confidence, so as to realign their expectations to more viable levels of profitability.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit22 PE 634.364REFERENCES\u2022 Alessandri, P. and B.D , Nelson.

This report provides a summary and assessment of the REVIEW, and suggests some open questions regarding supervisory activity. In our view, the findings of the REVIEW do not support the business model approach of supervisory guidance. The academic literature that attempts to pindown the causal link between profitability and banking business models provides at best mixed results. When the supervisor takes a consulting role, it will likely cause undesired effects for the stability of the banking system as a whole, undermining the supervisor\u2019s own core task.The REVIEW identifies several factors responsible for low profitability of banks in Europe, among them loan impairments and non-performing loans, digitalization and entry of fintech/big tech firms, regulatory standards, competition, and the macroeconomic environment. As the REVIEW explains, throughout in qualitative terms, the level of profitability and its main drivers differ significantly across institutions and countries. No easily identifiable common factors explaining the superior profitability of some institutions were found. Banks that are relatively cost-efficient differ in terms of size, business model and country of origin.Moreover, the term business model is used in different ways, also in the academic literature. We review the literature in section 2 of this report. It turns out to be difficult to identify a set of main determinants of bank profitability. These observations cast doubt on the usefulness of the term bank business model as a concept for description or management.We also note that the average level of profitability in banking may be relevant for financial stability considerations, but it should not be forgotten that profits are the outcome of a competitive process in the banking market. From this point of view, low profits may also be related to an overbanking status in the market as a whole, and poor-performing institutions may then be candidates for leaving the market, either through consolidation, or through outright exit.This is also one of the main points raised in our report: the link between profitability and industry structure (e.g level of exit, industry concentration and intensity of consolidation) does not receive sufficient attention in the REVIEW. The concern of supervisors with banks\u2019 micro- and macroeconomic profitability drivers, and the focus on bank management practices more generally, such as cost accounting, risk management, strategy consideration and the choice of business models is potentially helpful in understanding the risks faced by these banks. Nonetheless, we see the danger that the role of the supervisor as a referee applying regulatory standards and rules may be compromised by the alternative role of a coach who supports individual banks in raising their profitability level. Not only such an approach to supervision may stifle industry dynamics, but it might also facilitate regulatory capture and at the same time transform the supervisory policy in a coordination device.A better approach to banking supervision would be to focus on a continuous fulfillment of capital standards, equity and bail-in able debt, and exert a serious effort to prepare for a smooth market exit of weak institutions, should the standards be violated. With respect to this last point, we emphasize the importance of completing the banking union.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 9PREFACE1This paper is written for the use by the European Parliament, preparing a discussion of the 2018 SSM Thematic Review on Bank Profitability and Bank Business Models (henceforth the Review). Throughout the sections, we have proposed open questions that may help preparing the discussion in Parliament.Section 1 summarizes the main arguments in the Review. Section 2 reviews existing research on bank profitability, thereby setting the Review in perspective to the international literature. Section 3 develops our policy conclusions, including a general assessment of the SSM approach to banking supervision. We have delegated a more detailed overview of the empirical evidence on bank profitability in Europe to the Appendix A, including the role of the macroeconomic scenario and the low interest rate environment.1 The authors thank Patrick Blank from Research Center SAFE and Goethe University Frankfurt for outstanding research assistantship.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit10 PE 634.365SUMMARY OF 2018 SSM REVIEWA significant fraction of EU banks under the surveillance of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) earn low profit. Persistently low profitability is a concern for SSM for two main reasons: First, banks that do not have a sufficient return on equity (ROE) to cover their cost of capital would have little capacity to build up additional capital. Second, banks may be willing to take more risks to generate profits. In 2016 the SSM has decided to investigate this issue using a bank-level micro-perspective approach and proposed a thematic review on profitability and business models with the aim to (i) analyse the main drivers behind low profits in the European banking sector; (ii) deliver tools to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of business models adopted by banks, and (iii) evaluate their capacity to detect and alleviate these weaknesses, and their capacity to monitor how low profitability affects their risk-taking behavior.The Review highlights three main factors that explain why profits remain low: (i) high level of non-performing loans (NPL), (ii) macroeconomic conditions and (iii) competition. Despite a gradual decrease, the aggregate stock of NPLs is still high. One of conclusions presented in the Review is that the case of US banks has shown that cleaning up balance sheets quickly is beneficial to profitability. Moreover, Euro area banks still face significant litigation costs and heavy cost structure. Evidence for the latter is that, for example, \u201cthere are 40 or more branches per 100.000 inhabitants\u201d.Our observation: Since the financial architecture differs significantly between Europe and the US, benchmarking characteristics of one financial system (e.g number of branches per 100.000 inhabitants) against another may be misleading. For instance, the role of banking vis-\u00e0-vis capital markets for firms and households is generally much smaller in the US than in Europe. This leads the first question below:\u2022 Question 1: What should the appropriate density of branches for Europe be? More generally, what defines benchmarks if the role and importance of banks and capital markets differ across countries and continents?Second, general macroeconomic conditions, including heterogeneous labor markets and asymmetric expansions in the euro area push revenues down. Above all, unconventional monetary policy and low interest rates contribute to the persistence of low profitability, keeping interest margin compressed for an extended period. However, according to the Review, this is at least partly offset by its stimulating effect on loan growth and a reduction in the cost of risk to the point that the aggregate net interest income has not suffered a significant decline from 2016 to 2018. For a detailed description of our assessment of the effects of macroeconomic factors and low interest rates environement on bank profitability see Appendix A.Third, competition is putting pressure on revenues. On the one hand, the market remains highly fragmented, which gives a comparative advantage to bigger foreign banks. On the other hand, SSM banks face competition by non-banks. So far, fintechs have mostly restricted their business activities to the payments sector and there may be opportunities to develop partnerships. If, however, big tech companies enter the banking market, they are very likely to make use of their customers base and superior technological knowledge to compete independently2.However, on closer inspection, half of the SSM banks managed to increase their net interest income during the period considered in the Review. Supervisors, therefore, decided to hold managers2 Facebook\u00b4s proposal of Libra, Google\u2019s announcement concerning payment services (see FT Nov 13, 2019), and Apple\u2019s credit cards plans are all serious steps in that direction.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 11accountable and started reviewing banks\u2019 business models in the light of their capacity to generate profits. The aim seems to be to learn from the better-performing banks in order to improve the performance of the others.Our observation: It is surprising that among the three main factors that affect banks\u2019 profitability highlighted in the Review, two of them (macroeconomic conditions and banking competition) has not much to do with the business models. In fact, assuming competition is effective, an improvement of cost structures or a strengthening of strategic capabilities at the level of all banks simultaneously will likely not increase bank profits by a lot \u2013 the competitive pressure will eat away some or all of the additional profit margin.\u2022 Question 2: Does it make sense, in a competitive environment, to assume that learning from better-perfoming banks will increase profits across the board? Moreover, why should increasing profits of poor-performing banks be an objective of the SSM? In the limit, should the SSM engage itself in precluding the potential exit of low-performing banks?3The Review shows at some length that profitability varies from one institution to another irrespective of its size, its business model or its country of origin. Given these observations, the Review concludes that banks differ in their ability to strategically steer for profitability. That is, managers\u2019 capacity to align their course of action with the bank\u2019s long-term goals. The evaluation results, presented in the Review, cover the governance structure and several bank internal processes dealing with cost and income factors, loan pricing and strategy development.It appears that profitable banks have on average better strategic steering capabilities. High ability seems to be reflected by (i) a greater effectiveness of their Asset and Liability management, (ii) their distribution channels, (iii) their overall pricing process, (iv) their capacity to measure ex-ante and ex-post profitability individually and (v) their capacity to break down the cost structure.\u2022 Question 3: What are the benchmarks used to assess such diverse criteria as governance, strategy development, and risk pricing? What exactly are the empirical findings, what is their statistical and economic significance? In other words: From a purely methodological point of view, how strong or weak is the statistical basis for the conclusions drawn in this Review?Based on these findings, the Review derives conclusions concerning suboptimal management capabilities at the level of individual banks and also summarizes a variety of effective strategies observed among SSM banks to address the profitability challenges. What emerges is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to low profitability and supervisors are required to pay attention to the subtleties specific to each business model. More specifically, some banks have increased their lending volumes, they have diversified their income sources and reoriented their business towards fee and commissions-generating activities like cross-selling, private banking, asset management and insurance. Moreover, many weak banks have cleaned up their balance sheets and the best-performing banks have expanded internationally. Most banks regard the digital transformation as their key strategic priority. The agenda covers not only the provision of customer services but also the digitalization of internal processes.The Review is not entirely explicit about what is the understanding of the SSM when referring to different business models. However, chapter 5 is the closest that the report comes to providing a3 In a presentation at the Research Centre of Supervision and Regulation of the Financial Sector in Lisbon in July 2019, Andrea Enria, Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, pointed out that overbanking was at the root of the problem of low profitability. He stated that there is \u201dfierce competition, but only a few banks exit the market\u201d. This statement corroborates the point we raise on the importance of exit.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit12 PE 634.365characterization of those models. The 22 SIs with the highest ROEs and ROAs are divided into three different groups according to different identified strategies: i) the first group followed a high-income strategy, which is characterized by high costs but even higher income-generation capacity; ii) the second group employed a strategy of high cost-efficiency, and iii) the third group lies in the middle with a medium income generation capacity but also moderate operating costs.Our observation: We show in the next section of the paper that the literature is very heterogeneous when it comes to the characterization of business models in banking. Together with the lack of a clear definition in the Review, we pose the following question:\u2022 Question 4: What is exactly the current understanding of the SSM of banking business models? To what extent does the SSM use this notion as the basis for a supervisory tool?In 2018, the banking supervision initiated a dialogue with banks about their internal processes. There, institutions were encouraged to run firm-specific risk-mitigation programmes to counteract increased risk-taking by banks in response to persistently low profits. In the Review, three types of risk are considered relevant: First, banks are said to be overly optimistic about the long-term success of their business model. Execution risks from exogenous developments, including changes to the regulatory framework, more intense competition and macroeconomic shocks, are underestimated. Second, credit risks arise, among other reasons, because credit standards have been lowered and pricing strategies have become more aggressive. Third, there are operational risks from digitalization. The Review emphasises that cost minimization must not be achieved at the expense of risk monitoring.The Review suggests that the dialogue eventually helps banks to better understand their business model, improve its risk management practice, and ultimately increase the bank\u2019s bottom line. This leads to question 5.\u2022 Question 5: To what extent is it common SSM policy to advice supervised banks in achieving improved management practices, as formulated in the Review? In other words: To what extent are the findings reported in this Review used by supervisors in a way that advises, triggers, or leads individual banks towards a particular strategic direction \u2013 be it cost accounting, risk assessment, loan pricing or business model related?What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 13RESEARCH ON EUROPEAN BANK PROFITABILITYBusiness models and profitabilityA large and growing body of empirical papers investigates the factors that affect bank profitability in Europe and elsewhere. In this section, we summarize some of the relevant research, which attempts to identify a link between profitability of the banking industry and the choice of business models. The objective is to verify whether the focus of the Review on business models is to some extent justified by the existing research literature. We find that the literature provides no obvious nor unique definition of business models for banks. Many studies resort to cluster analysis using different performance measures. But as they should, the variables used in those studies vary according to the question of the paper. Most importantly, the conclusions drawn in the literature about the causal link between profitability and business models are shaky at best. Moreover, the fact that there is no unique business model that generates high profitability is to be expected in an industry of differentiated products and services for which a complex menu of strategies is available. We conclude that, supervisors do not have support from the scientific literature to provide informed recommendations regarding the business model choice of banks.Farn\u00e8 et al. (2017)4, for example, argue that they are not able to identify \u201csuperior\u201d or \u201cinferior\u201d business models in terms of their ability to achieve sustainable profits. The authors use a rich dataset of supervisory data in order to distinguish common business models in the European banking industry. They use a clustering methodology run on risk and performace indicators and identify four distinct business: wholesale funded banks, security holdings banks, traditional commercial banks and complex commercial banks.Similarly, Detragiache et al. (2018)5 show that there is no clear evidence that attributes of the bank\u2019s business model, such as higher reliance on fees and commission income, were associated with better profitability. The authors investigate the factors that affect European banks\u2019 profitability through the recent financial cycle. Unsurprisingly, they find that highly profitable banks were those that experienced smaller deterioration in loan quality and a larger improvement in cost efficiency. Perhaps more interesting would be to understand why some banks do better than others in the loan selection process. The paper identifies many factors that had an impact on bank profitability during and after the crisis, e.g the degree of balance sheet expansions or contractions and the level of capitalization at the onset of the crisis. The authors conclude that common factors in all regions continue to depress bank profitability such as increased regulation, low interest rates and technological change.In order to explore the relationship between business models and bank profitability, a recent study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF, 2018) displayed a scatterplot of two different ratios that are often used to distinguish business models: the deposits-to-asset-ratio and the loans-to-asset-ratio. Figure 4 in Appendix B shows that bank profitability does not seem to be correlated to any specific business model. The weakly performing banks (red dots) are rather randomly distributed across the universe of other banks. The IMF summarizes that \u201cthe incident of low ROE is strewn across a wide variation in business models.\u201dDespite the difference of research questions, Lucas et al. (2019) and Albertazzi and Gambacorta (2009) reach similar conclusions regarding the possibility of using the choice of business models as a guidance for supervisory actions. Lucas et al. (2019) study empirically how European banks with different4 From the ECB working paper series.5 From the IMF working paper series.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit14 PE 634.365business models reacted to the financial crisis and cope with today\u2019s low interest rate environment. The study clusters banks into six business model components and analyzes how these different clusters evolve over time. The authors find that the global 2008 financial crisis affected banks with different business models differently and that the business model influences how banks adapt to the low interest rate environment in the post-crisis period. Albertazzi and Gambacorta (2009) study the link between business cycle fluctuations and banking sector profitability. They find large country level differences in the ability of banks to protect net interest income from cyclic yield curve fluctuations and conjecture that differences in asset duration and the prevalence of lending relationships in some countries contribute to the heterogeneity of observed vulnerabilities.Some papers indicate that diversified banks show a higher level of profitability. Dietrich and Wanzenried (2014) analyze the impact of bank-specific characteristics, macroeconomic variables, and industry-specific factors on bank profitability across 118 countries. The study identifies numerous factors that affect profitability. The national income level, the level of competition, bank ownership (private, public, foreign ownership), and high income diversification are all shown to be are associated with higher bank profitability. Petria et al. (2015) also investigate bank-specific, industry specific and macroeconomic factors of bank profitability in 27 EU countries. The study also includes one factor that is related to the bank\u2019s business model: a business mix indicator that measures the relative importance of \u201cother operational income\u201d. The study shows a positive association of diversification and bank\u2019s return on equity.Several studies (see e.g Becalli et al., 2015; Menicucci and Paolucci, 2016) investigate the impact of size and economies of scale for European banks. These studies generally find evidence of increased profitability levels for large banks. However, the link of this result to business model choice is weak. Large banks display considerable heterogeneity with respect to their business models.Bonaccorsi di Patti and Kashyap (2017) attempt to shed light on the factors governing the speed of bank recovery from large adverse shocks. Their analysis of banks hit by the Italian crisis shows that the ability to recover is mainly driven by idiosyncratic risks and therefore difficult to forecast by systematic factors such as business model choice. Interestingly and counterintuitive to common supervisory thinking, the study shows that banks with concentrated loan portfolios recover more often than banks with well diversified loan portfolios. Supervisory guidance on business models such as the encouragement of better loan portfolio diversification thus may undermine bank recovery after a crisis.Rossi et al. (2018) investigate the balance sheet characteristics and other determinants of bank profitability in the Euro area before and after the financial crisis. The authors observe that the academic literature has identified different factors that affect bank profitability over time. There are two possible explanations for such changes. One of the reasons provided in the paper is that a changing industry and competitive scenario is likely to reward a different set of strategies. However, another explanation we see and also a reason for concern with this exercise is that not all factors identified might be structural, in other words, the real determinants for profitability. These causal variables are not easy to identify. Characteristics such as size that might be seen as a determinant of performance, might be instead caused by performance itself. A well-performing bank is likely to gain market-share and grow. This implies that supervisors should be cautious on deriving recipes for winning-strategies based on such analysis.A part of the literature identifies the importance of corporate governance practices for banks\u2019 performance. Hau and Thum (2009) provide evidence of a systematic underperformance of Germany\u2019s state-owned banks and relate it to the quality of bank governance, documenting that the magnitude of bank losses in the financial crisis are associated with board incompetence in finance. Cu\u00f1at and Garicano (2009) show that the Spanish Cajas whose chief executives had no prior banking experienceWhat are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 15and no graduate education - but did have strong political connection - extended more loans to real estate developers and fared substantially worse both before and during the crisis. The close connection between politicians and bank managers was also a factor in Spanish supervisors\u2019 regulatory forbearance during the crisis, and the banks\u2019 forbearance on bad loans to developers (Garicano, 2012). Similarly, the debacle of Monte dei Paschi di Siena in Italy \u2013 whose main shareholder is a foundation largely controlled by local politicians \u2013 originates from the botched acquisition of Banca Antonveneta in 2007, performed by a politically connected bank chief.6 In our view, these dynamics are common to other countries with strong community-owned savings banks.The most important finding is the fact that bank recovery depends to a large extent on the ability of banks to become more stringent when extending credit to their riskiest customers. This ability bears most likely little relation to business model choices. In a related study, Bongini et al. (2019) also investigate how European banks perform in periods of recovery of crisis. Consistent with the results of Bonaccorsi di Patti and Kashyap (2017), they conclude that recovery is mainly driven by credit risk and lending policy decisions. Business models of banks seem to play no major role.Profitability seems also closely related to the channels that generate overbanking and excessive risk taking in Europe: see ESRB\u2019s Advisory Scientific Committee (2014) report on \u201cIs Europe Overbanked?\u201d. This report identifies three channels responsible for Europe\u2019s overbanking: \u201c(i) public support for banks and inadequate prudential supervision; (ii) political support for banks, encouraging them to over-expand; and (iii) technological innovations and increased competition in banking.In this section, we made repeatedely the point that there is no empirical justification, based on the existing literature, for the superiority of certain banking business models, which could be of guidance to the supervisory activity. We conclude with the following questions:\u2022 Question 6: What exactly are the types of business models identified by the SSM?\u2022 Question 7: What enables the SSM to identify strong performance differences among bank business models that are absent in the academic literature? Is it superior information, a novel empirical evaluation of such models, or a different interpretation of the term \u201cbusiness model\u201d?Benchmark for banking industry profitabilityThe SSM Review describes the European banking industry as \u201clagging behind\u201d their American counterparts in terms of profitability.7 This wording seems to suggest that it is only a matter of time until European profitability levels rebound to pre-crisis levels, following with some delay the American banking industry.Our view is more gloomy as we see a stronger parallel of the current European scenario to Japan, rather than to the US. We believe that structural factors, such as a given level of overbanking and a strong role of government-owned banking, tend to depress profitability in Europe. This renders a quick bank recovery from the crisis, as it was experienced in the US, less likely for Europe. In contrast, another widely studied recovery from a banking crisis has perhaps more similarity with the European situation: the case of Japan. The Japanese banking crisis emanated from the collapse of real estate and other asset prices in the early 1990s and resulted in a decade of low and mostly negative bank profits.Whether Europe today is more similar to the US or to Japan is of great importance for the consequences one may draw from the subdued profit level in European banking. If Europe follows the US, then the6 See the ESRB\u2019s Advisory Scientific Committee (2014) report: 35-40.7 ECB (2018), p. 8: \u201cWhile US banks managed a faster recovery after the crisis, SSM banks are still adjusting.\u201d; \u201cEuro area banks\u2019 profits are still lagging behind.\u201dIPOL Economic Governance Support Unit16 PE 634.365longer-term outlook for bank profitability is rather positive, and tactical or strategic adjustments will help to reach higher profitability sooner or later. However, if Japan is the more realistic model, then efficiency gains at the level of individual banks will not automatically lead to a profit enhancement any time soon. For a comparison of aggregate return on equity of banks in Japan, US, and Europe see Appendix A.88 At a first glance, Figure 1 may suggest that the performance of European Banks as measured by ROE follows a more similar path to the US banks than of Japan. That may be well true during the period following the Japanese banking crisis, but as much as the ROE of Eurpean and US banks co-move, they are not at the same level. The US banking system was always operated with higher returns, with the exception of the period between 2008 and 2010. What we would like to strees on Figure 1 is the speed of recovery of the US banking system when ROE drops below 0. That, we believe, is a unique feature of the US banking system.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 17POLICY CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSThe SSM thematic review on profitability and business models concludes that many factors are responsible for the subdued profitability of European banks, among them high impairments, legacy of NPLs, the economic environment, digitalization and new fintech and big tech competitors, tough regulation and low levels of market consolidation.Moreover, the analysis in the Review shows very clearly that banks are not affected uniformly by these factors. In contrast, the level of profitability and its drivers differs widely across institutions. The Review rejects the hypothesis that there are some easily identifiable common factors explaining the superior profitability of some banks. The report concludes: \u201cFor some this was due to being very cost-efficient, while others managed to generate significantly higher revenues (relative to their total assets) than their peers. These banks are diverse in terms of size, business model and country of origin. This emphasizes that each bank needs to find its optimal trade-off and that it is feasible to be profitable even in challenging macroeconomic conditions regardless of a bank\u2019s business model.\u201dWe find this to be an important observation, and possibly the major insight of the Review. Changing bank business models is no panacea for improved profitability, let alone for increased financial stability. We also stressed in the paper based on the review of the academic literature and on the Review itself, there is no clear-cut definition of how business models for the banking industry should be defined.Moreover, it is paramount to stress that the concern of the SSM with profitability should be of a restricted nature. The question that the supervisor has to be concerned with is: \u201cHow does low profitability affect stability of the European banking system?\u201d Low profitability reduces the ability of banks to build buffers to live through negative stocks. This justifies the concern of bank supervisors with low profitability. At the same time, it also shows that maximizing profitability of the industry is not and should not be a concern of the supervisor. There are many reasons for high or low bank profitability, and it is difficult to find a unique driver for an increase in bank market valuation and profitability when the individual institutions are subject to competition amongst themselves, and from new entrants that threaten to debase established business models.We note that even if it were possible to identify drivers of profitability, it remains highly contentious that improved management practices on the side of several banks will lead to a profitability increase for all these banks. In fact, increasing efficiency at the level of many banks simultaneously may well lead to lower market prices rather than higher profits, or a mix of both.Furthermore, a related remark relates to the knowledge about bank management practice at the level of the supervisory agency. Although the tone of the Review, in our reading of the text, is unequivocally optimistic as to the competency of supervisors to understand and to guide existing business models, the actual findings reported in the Review flatly reject any claim for superior knowledge or better understanding of what banks do or ought to do in order to raise profitability. That is not surprising in a regulator-regulated firm relationship. In fact, the literature on regulated industries often prescribes a type of regulation that keeps the regulator away from suggesting the type of business model.9 The regulator should not diminish, to the extent possible, the dynamism of the industry. In our view, playing a consulting role to the industry would generate exactly the opposite effect than the one intended. In addition, generating a hazard for financial stability.Seen through the lens of research findings, as reported in the previous section, the supervisory concept underlying the main hypotheses in the Review, namely the assistance of banks to improve their9 See Vives (2016) for an analysis of regulation specific for the banking industry.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit18 PE 634.365business model, is uncovered as what it really is: a pretension, and a dangerous one for that. There are many statements in the Review that suggest having or claiming to have a rather detailed bank management knowledge on the side of bank supervisors, including an understanding, superior to the one held by actual bank management, of what individual banks ought to do in order to succeed in a competitive market environment. Surprisingly, the broad analytical attempt to find a reliable set of explanatory variables in a statistical exercise clearly failed. For us, as readers of the Review, it is therefore incomprehensible why the obvious conclusions from the own findings are not even mentioned, let alone heeded: the Review\u2019s findings reject the business model approach to supervisory guidance.The fact that common drivers of business model profitability cannot be identified does not surprise us. In competitive markets profits, in particular high profits, are derived from innovations and market power \u2013 both aspects cannot easily be engineered through standard management practices. Moreover, even if some engineering would be possible, its effect on profits would easily be wiped out if all competing institutions would follow simultaneously the same path, the same advice. Aside from stifling the industry dynamics, there is an obvious danger of transforming the supervisory policy in a collusion device, or at least to foster some sort of herding behavior on the side of the banking industry. When all banks use the same pricing guidelines, consumer prices may increase and competition may be weakened.This brings us to a central point of our conclusion: the supervisory pretension, embedded in the business model approach, is potentially dangerous \u2013 for the banks, and for the SSM. The SSM may be tempted to tailor its regulatory requirements around its own assessment of what constitutes good and bad business models. As a consequence, banks will tend to follow the pressure from the supervisor, and build their business models, their cost accounting formulae, their risk management strategies, their loan pricing tools, and so on, on the concepts championed by the supervisor. However, there is no substantive basis for business guidance on the side of supervisors.One may even conjecture, disturbingly, that it will be the weakest banks in particular that are inclined to follow the business model guidance of the supervisors closely, in an attempt to appear compliant and win the supervisory recognition.Consistent with the supervisory pretense, or hubris, hypothesis, the SSM also claims in its Review that banks with better strategic steering capabilities, according to the assessment of joint supervisory teams (JST), have generated higher profits than other banks.10 The Review is quite precise in its definition of what constitutes strategic steering capabilities. For example, the report lists- a detailed understanding of the income drivers across business lines or geographical areas;- breakdown of costs by business line or distribution channel;- a cost allocation system that allocates costs to business areas or to the lowest level possible;- and a comprehensive loan pricing framework and pricing models that includes a minimum price (pricing floor) to cover all costs and risks.There is evidence that the SSM is actively influencing individual banks in their own business decisions. A study of Moody\u2019s (2018) states that the SSM has issued bank-specific recommendations regarding the necessary improvements to strategic steering or risk management capabilities as a result of the thematic review project. The recommendations involve understanding income and expense drivers, cost management and allocation, and loan pricing and strategy-setting processes. The report further10 ECB (2018), p. 15: There is no discussion about endogeneity in the document, importantly required to single out cause and effect.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 19states that SSM will monitor implementation of the expected improvements in strategic steering capabilities as part of the ongoing supervision.In our view, this is first evidence of direct interference by bank supervisors into bank management decision making. This evidence is disturbing, in our opinion, since we believe that such active or passive guidance for business practice may eventually hit back and may even destabilize the banking system.The reason is obvious: the advice given by the supervisors will enhance herding in bank behavior, particularly among weak banks. Moreover, the business model approach to supervisory guidance is likely to create an implicit liability on the side of the SSM.Assume the supervisor guides an individual institution in the direction of a particular business decision, say allocating capital to a purportedly profitable, or rather safe activity. Assume further that there is a sudden economic shock that reduces profits at the wrong place or creates uncertainty where there was none before. Clearly, the supervisor may now face pressure for rescue-and-relief measures which it might find difficult to reject. The business model approach to supervisory guidance, therefore, entails the risk of regulatory capture, caused by overstepping the mandate, and becoming too close to the supervisee.In fact, according to the rule book of the regulator, the supervisor is supposed to act as a referee in a competitive banking game, showing yellow or red cards to players that do not wish to, or are not capable of playing by the rules. This should not encourage the supervisor to be, or act as, the coach of the various players. Much like in football, roles of referees and coaches are well defined, and distinct, for a good reason.Our criticism of the Review, in which the SSM seems to fall prey of dangerous hubris, raises the natural question: how would a better supervisory approach look like? May it suffice to say, in this report, that an alternative approach to banking supervision would concentrate on two characteristics of banks: first, a sufficiently high level of capital at individual banks, i.e a sufficiently high sum of equity and bail-in able debt, and second, a sufficiently credible preparation for bank resolution. The role of the SSM, together with the SRB, is in this alternative scenario foremost an enabler of orderly exit, when needed, rather than a preserver of an incumbent institution.In other words, a possible benchmark for the supervisory strategy would prescribe how the SSM prepares weak banks for a smooth exit from the market, thereby yielding room for entry, innovation and change in the industrial organization of Europe\u2019s banking industry. An exit-friendly-orientation of the SSM would quite naturally enhance the role to be played by the SRB in the financial system \u2013 as it was originally envisaged by the architects of the new banking regulation in Europe.11This brings us to a final comment, which we believe to be essential for the stability and sustainability of the European financial system: namely the completion of the banking union, including the need for harmonization in resolution and liquidation. A Banking Union that is not complete can hardly be sustainable. A truly integrated European banking market would in turn facilitate the job of the SSM in achieving its main goals, i.e to \u201cincrease financial integration and stability\u201d12 of the European financial system13.11 See the 2012 Liikanen report on reforming the structure of the EU banking sector, and G\u00f6tz et al (2017).12 See SSM website:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/about/thessm/html/index.en.html13\">https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/about/thessm/html/index.en.html13</url> A similar point was made by Kerstin af Jochnick in her keynote speech at the 7th Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy organized by SAFE on th 15th of November 2019.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/speeches/date/2019/html/ssm.sp191115_1~1274db139d.en.htmlIPOL\">https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/speeches/date/2019/html/ssm.sp191115_1~1274db139d.en.htmlIPOL</url> Economic Governance Support Unit20 PE 634.365REFERENCESAlbertazzi, U. and L.

Top panel shows data from the US, bottom panel compares Japan and Europe to the US.14 The difference in time interval from the two graphs of Figure 1 is due to data availability. In the first graph, one can see both US banking crisis fo the 80s and of the 2008.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit24 PE 634.365The two U.S banking crises of the 80s and of 2008 are associated with strongly negative returns on equity which are followed by a quick rebound to pre-crisis profitability levels. In stark contrast, the Japanese banking crisis resulted in a full decade of negative or near zero return on equity figures for Japanese banks. European banks show a decade of lowered post crisis profitability with profitability levels well above the post crisis time period in Japan. The data shows that a financial crisis has very heterogenous effects on post-crisis profitability. There is little reason to believe that the European banking sector will follow the US experience with some delay as the SSM thematic review seems to suggest.The stock market valuation of European banks continues to be alarmingly low. The following figure compares market-to-book-ratio in 2011 and 2019 for major global banking markets. It shows that the median market-to-book-ratio for European banks is substantially below 1 and did only slightly improve between 2011 and 2019. Low price-to-book ratios may have two explanations that probably both contribute to the observed findings: First, assets on the balance sheet such as NPLs or investments in associate corporations may not have been written down yet and the market expects additional future write-downs. It is widely acknowledged that many European banks still have elevated stocks of legacy assets and future profitability will be reduced by write-downs of these assets. Second, the market does not seem to expect that banking returns to an adequate level of profitability in the future.Figure 2: Market-to-book-ratio in 2011 and 2019 for major global banking markets15Source: McKinsey (2019)Macroeconomic FactorsThe market outlook on bank profitability is presumably also subdued by macroeconomic factors. ECB vice president De Guindos recently stressed that \u201ccyclical factors have helped to improve bank profitability in recent years\u201d (De Guindos, 2019). But GDP growth has been declining recently and the prospect of an upcoming recession may further weigh on bank profits.A recent paper published in the ECB Financial Stability Review (Andersson et al., 2018) finds that \u201cthe level of earnings for many banks is still below that required by investors and bank profitability is still15 This graph is extracted from th McKinsey Global Banking Annual Review 2019. In the text they are explicit about the difference between Continental Europe and European Union, which includes the UK. Therefore we assume the report is consistent in its methodology, which implies the UK is also included in the European Union bar.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 25vulnerable to a possible turnaround in the business cycle.\u201d The study quotes the following challenges for the European banking industry: \u201clow cost-efficiency, a lack of consolidation and high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) in some jurisdictions.\u201d A natural question to ask is: when and how will the process towards consolidation and improved cost-efficiency start? Initiatives to improve cost-efficiency should be viewed as a long-term investment project. They are very cost-intensive in the beginning because they require massive investments in information technology and massive reductions in workforce.Both are expensive and beyond the financial capacity of many banks, particularly in countries with highly protective labor laws, where severance payments act like a tax on workforce reductions. The likely outcome is that only few banks can afford to invest in modern information technology and can afford to reduce their workforce significantly. These banks will in the long run increase their competitive strength and drive other banks out of the market. Only after a substantial number of banks have exited the banking market, the remaining banks can be expected to achieve the scale of operations that allows a sustainable level of profitability for the majority of the remaining banks.\u2022 Question 8: Are the policies of the SSM impeding, or delaying the process of consolidation in the banking industry and, thus, a more rapid improvements of the cost-income ratio?Low interest rate environmentThe prospect of continuing low interest rates and negative policy rates can be expected to decrease European bank profitability further in the future. Jobst and Lin (2016) investigate in detail how negative interest rates affect bank profitability. In order to understand the impact of interest rates on bank profitability, three interest rate environments should be distinguished: (i) declining rates, (ii) stable low rates, and (iii) increasing rates. In order to understand the profitability impacts, it is important to notice that bank assets tend to have a longer maturity than liabilities and are therefore repriced less often.The repricing of bank\u2019s assets and liabilities is further characterized by the fact that asset (loan) rates typically respond strongly to market interest rate changes while liability (deposit) rates react in a weaker extent to market interest rate changes.16 Current accounts are an important funding source of banks and do not react at all to interest rate changes as most current accounts do not pay any interest rates.(i) Declining rates: Most post-crisis years were characterized by declining interest rates. This increased bank profitability through several channels: First, funding costs decline faster than interest rate earnings on (longer-term) loans because of longer maturity assets. Second, declining rates increase bond prices and thus causing an increase of trading profits from bond holdings. Third, banks benefit from low defaults as borrowers find it easier to service loans.(ii) Stable low rates: In a period of stable low rates, funding costs cease to decline further but a bank\u2019s asset returns (on loans and bonds) continue to decline gradually as more and more maturing old (high yielding) assets need to be replaced by new low yielding loans. The profit deterioration continues until all high yielding loans (and bonds) have matured and replaced by new low yielding loans. The interest rate margin earned by banks is further depressed when liability rates hit a lower bound of zero interest rates.1716 Take current accounts from retail customers as an example. These constitute a liability for banks which usually comes with zero interest rate costs irrespective of the prevailing interest rate level.17 We assume that banks find it impossible to charge negative rates to a sizeable fraction of their customers.IPOL Economic Governance Support Unit26 PE 634.365Lower asset returns cannot be further compensated by lower liability costs and the margin deteriorates further. Jobst and Lin (2016) stress that the reduction of profitability caused by negative policy rates also depends on the excess liquidity situation of banks. Excess liquidity is the amount of short-term liquid customer funds that is invested in liquidity reserves and earns negative interest rates.The amount of excess liquidity strongly depends on the macroeconomic environment: banks in countries with current account surpluses such as Germany and the Netherlands have higher excess liquidity and thus suffer from negative policy rates in a disproportionate way. Summing up, a continuation of the current low interest rate environment will not only lead to perpetuated low profits but can indeed be expected to reduce bank profits even further.(iii) Increasing rates: Should the future lead unexpectedly to a period of increasing interest rates, the situation is unlikely to improve quickly. In this scenario, bank profits will come under even more pressure at least during an adjustment period. Credit losses will increase as borrowers find it more difficult to service debt. Bond prices decline and cause trading losses. Finally, the balance sheets of banks may be characterized by a large amount of low yielding loans that may be fixed-rate and have been originated in the low interest rate environment. While banks will be forced to pay higher market interest rates to short term depositors, the income from the loan portfolio will grow much slower because long maturity loans will be replaced only gradually by new and higher yielding loans.Another factor that increasingly threatens bank profits is the fact that advances in information technology make it easier for bank customers to compare bank products and prices. For example, bank customers increasingly use internet searches and web platforms in order to find attractive deposit rate offerings. Some FinTechs operate deposit platforms such that consumers can easily choose between the offerings of many banks and are able to transfer their funds from one bank to another quick and easy with few mouse clicks. As a result, competition and market contestability increases and profit margins in the retail deposit market come under increasing pressure.A study by the IMF forecasts European bank profitability for the coming years. It concludes that most large European banks are not expected to realize a return on equity that covers their cost of capital as required by capital markets.

Red dots indicate weakly performing banks where ROE is below 8%.What are the main factors for the subdued profitability of significant banks in the Banking Union?PE 634.365 29Appendix C enumerates the possible questions1. In comparison with the US, what should the appropriate density of branches for Europe be? More generally, what defines benchmarks if the role and importance of banks and capital markets differ across countries and continents?2. Does it make sense, in a competitive environment, to assume that learning from better-perfoming banks will increase profits across the board? Moreover, why should increasing profits of poor-performing banks be an objective of the SSM? In the limit, should the SSM engage itself in precluding the potential exit of low-performing banks?3. What are the benchmarks used to assess such diverse criteria as governance, strategy development, and risk pricing? What exactly are the empirical findings, what is their statistical and economic significance? In other words: From a purely methodological point of view, how strong or weak is the statistical basis for the conclusions drawn in this Review?4. What is exactly the current understanding of the SSM of baking business models? To what extent does the SSM use this notion as the basis for a supervisory tool?5. To what extent is it common SSM policy to help supervised banks achieving improved management practices, as formulated in the Review? In other words: To what extent are the findings reported in this Review used by supervisors in a way that advises, triggers, or leads individual banks towards a particular strategic direction \u2013 be it cost accounting, risk assessment, loan pricing or business model related?6. What exactly are the types of business model identified by the SSM?7. What enables the SSM to identify strong performance differences among bank business models that are absent in the academic literature? Is it superior information, a novel empirical evaluation of such models, or a different interpretation of the term \u201cbusiness model\u201d?8. Are the policies of the SSM impeding, or delaying the process of consolidation in the banking industry and, thus, a more rapid improvements of the cost-income ratio?9. Are there any structural differences between the banking markets in the US and Europe that weigh on profitability levels, e.g overbanking, fiercer or weaker competition, and structure and performance of the national/regional economy? What do these differences imply in terms of individual bank business models?IPOL Economic Governance Support UnitPE 634.365IP/A/ECON-BU/FWC/2015-057Print ISBN 978-92-846-- 6075-9 doi:10.2861/ 676788 QA- 02-19-956--EN-CPDF ISBN 978-92-846- - 6076-6 doi:10.2861/ 72607 QA- 02-19-956 -EN-NIn this paper we argue that the own findings of the SSM THEMATIC REVIEW ON PROFITABILITY AND BUSINESS MODEL and the academic literature on bank profitability do not provide support for the business model approach of supervisory guidance. We discuss in the paper several reasons why the regulator should stay away from intervening in management practices. We conclude that by taking the role of a coach instead of a referee, the supervisor generates a hazard for financial stability.This document was provided by the Economic Governance Support Unit at the request of the ECON Committee).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2711289</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPK-YM41-JDG9-Y0NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11106\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Last April an AFET delegation travelled to Moldova and Ukraine to evaluate the level of implementation of these AAs. It concluded that, on top of ensuring political will for reform and fighting corruption, it is crucial for these countries to have a solid and wellfunctioning institutional framework. Policy Department EXPO\u2019s recent study on The Development of an Institutional Framework for the Implementation of the Association Agreements in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine: a comparative perspective, provides an analysis of the state of play of the institutional framework in the three countries, the main progress and key challenges. It also highlights how the EU can assist the countries by providing the necessary systemic support in an integrated, sequenced and long-term way.

Criminal procedural laws across the European Union Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs August 2018 Despite the EU intense legislative activity in criminal matters, differences between national criminal procedures affect the negotiation and operation of EU instruments.

Conditionality is an established EU governance tool that may usefully assist the EU to ensure compliance and effective application of its laws and policies throughout EU spending operations at the national level. In the 2014-20 financial period, the use of conditionalities in Cohesion policy has been significantly extended. Potential revenue from the extension of charging fees by EU Agencies Policy Department for Budgetary Affairs September 2018 This study for BUDG committee explores the potential revenue from the extension of charging fees by EU Agencies.

Under the current EU legal framework, digital or online platforms are not legally responsible for hosting illegal content, but are required to remove such material once it is flagged. However, technologies and business models have evolved in the last 20 years and the EU liability framework struggles to capture liability issues raised by new actors, such as search engines, social networks and online marketplaces. Furthermore, societal challenges have changed the nature and scale of liability, with the development of a range of new harmful online practices, such as the dissemination of terrorist content online, the increasing use of platforms to distribute counterfeit products and the spreading of false or misleading news and online advertisements. The European Commission has pledged to present a new framework to increase and harmonise the responsibilities of online platforms. New EU legislation is expected in the forthcoming digital services act package, and this will set rules on how companies such as Google, Facebook and Twitter will have to police illegal and possibly harmful content online. Against this background, this paper aims to (1) describe the current EU liability regime for online intermediaries set out under the E-commerce Directive; (2) highlight the implementation gaps that have been identified; and (3) present the main proposals for reforming such an online liability regime and the main policy questions that have been discussed so far.AUTHORTambiama Madiega, Members' Research Service, EPRSThis paper has been drawn up by the Members' Research Service, within the Directorate-General for Parliamentary Research Services (EPRS) of the Secretariat of the European Parliament.To contact the author, please email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:eprs@ep.europa.euLINGUISTIC\">eprs@ep.europa.euLINGUISTIC</email> VERSIONSOriginal: ENTranslations: DE, FRManuscript completed in April 2020.DISCLAIMER AND COPYRIGHTThis document is prepared for, and addressed to, the Members and staff of the European Parliament as background material to assist them in their parliamentary work.

The legislation introduced a 'safe harbour' principle, under which online intermediaries who host or transmit content provided by a third party are exempt from liability unless they are aware of the illegality and are not acting adequately to stop it. They are subject to 'duties of care' and 'notice and take down' obligations to remove illegal online content. Furthermore, under the EU liability regime, online intermediaries cannot be subject to a general obligation to monitor their users' online content \u2013 to protect users' fundamental rights such as privacy and freedom of expression \u2013 while self-regulation has largely been encouraged for removing and disabling access to illegal information.However, numerous studies have shown that the way the E-commerce Directive has been implemented across the EU varies greatly and that national jurisprudence on online liability today remains very fragmented, while European Court of Justice case law does not provide sufficient guidance. Several gaps have been identified in this respect. First, it remains unclear to what extent the new type of online services, such as social media companies that have appeared since the adoption of the E-commerce Directive, fall within the definition of 'information society services' providers that can benefit from the liability exemption. Second, the 'safe harbour' conditions and 'notice-and-take down' obligations are unclear essentially because the underlying notions which are used to trigger the liability exemption, such as the distinction between 'passive' role and 'active' and the meaning of 'illegal activities', lack a proper definition. There are also considerable differences both with regard to the definition and the functioning of notice-and-take down throughout the EU. Third, it is becoming difficult to differentiate between prohibited 'general' content monitoring and acceptable 'specific' content monitoring, while automatic filtering mechanisms are increasingly used to detect illegal content.Against this background, the European Commission is expected to table a proposal to revise the liability regime as part of the forthcoming digital services act. Expert proposals vary from clarifying the current regime of exemption of liabilities to creating a secondary liability regime for online intermediaries. Policy-makers are expected to address a wide range of policy questions. First, an extension of the scope of the EU legislation to encompass both 'illegal' and 'harmful' content has been proposed and the question of whether 'online disinformation' and 'online advertisements' should fall under the scope of the revised liability regime has been raised. Second, setting a robust liability framework relies on defining precise concepts and ensuring compliance with EU fundamental rights, especially with freedom of speech and privacy rights. To that end, academia and stakeholders call for substantial revision of the EU framework, to clarify whether new digital services providers, such as social networks, online advertising services, collaborative economy platforms and online marketplaces, could or could not benefit from the safe harbour regime. This entails a need to clarify the difference between 'active' and 'passive' online intermediaries, to amend and further harmonise the 'notice and take down' regimes, to clarify the use of 'automated filtering' measures and the need for adequate procedural safeguards. Furthermore, the opportunity to enshrine a 'Good Samaritan' clause under EU law, to incentivise online intermediaries to better control the content they host and to include a set of new obligations in the liability regime, as well as to ensure algorithm transparency and neutrality, are discussed. Finally, consideration should be given to the definition of roles and powers granted to digital platform regulators in the EU.EPRS European Parliamentary Research ServiceIITable of contents1.

E-commerce Directive liability regime: BackgroundThe key principles of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries are enshrined in the E-commerce Directive1 adopted in 2000. The directive's overarching goal was to foster the development of electronic commerce in the European Union (EU). To that end, the Union set up a common legal framework to ensure the free movement of information society services between Member States and ensure legal certainty and consumer confidence in online commerce. The directive therefore aims at approximating national laws in various fields, including with regard to the establishment of service providers in the EU, rules applicable to commercial communications, electronic contracts and the liability of online intermediaries.21.1 Liability regime: Aim and scope of the directiveThe E-commerce Directive provisions on liability were adopted to address the divergences observed in court rulings and national legislation that resulted in legal uncertainty for online service providers in the EU and in creating obstacles for the internal market.3 The directive aims therefore at defining a set of specific rules under which 'information society service' providers \u2013 commonly referred to as 'online intermediaries' \u2013 who host or transmit illegal content provided by a third party are exempt from liabilities when certain conditions are fulfilled. As such, the directive does not provide with a general liability regime for 'online intermediaries' but instead carves out specific rules under which those intermediaries are not held liable under EU law (i.e , safe harbour regimes).The E-commerce Directive liability rules apply to all 'information society services', defined as services that are 'normally' provided 'for remuneration' by 'electronic means' upon 'an individual request of a user'.4 The notion of 'information society services' spans a wide range of online economic activities including selling goods online, offering online information or commercial communications, providing online search tools allowing for search, provision of electronic network and services, video-on-demand or the provision of commercial communications by electronic mail.5 As a result, a large array of online actors ranging from traditional electronic communications providers (e.g internet service providers) to new online intermediaries (e.g search engines, social media companies, software and game and cloud providers), potentially fall under the scope of the E-commerce Directive.1.2 Safe harbour regimes and horizontal approachThe E-commerce Directive introduces a safe harbour principle, under which three types of online intermediaries who host or transmit content provided by a third party are exempt from liability under certain conditions.1 See Directive 2000/31/EC.2 Only the provisions (i.e Articles 11 to 15) relating directly to the liability regime will be discussed here. Other issues, including the question of whether or not to maintain the country of origin principle, fall outside the scope of this paper.3 See European Commission, EU study on the legal analysis of a single market for the information society: New rules for a new age?, 2014.4 See Art. 2(a) of Directive 2000/31/EC (above). See also Article 1 (1) (b) Directive 2015/1535 (which replaced Directive 98/34/EC).5 See Recital 18 of Directive 2000/31/EC (above). Television and radio broadcasting, video-on-demand and the provision of commercial communications by electronic mail are not information society services.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service2\u2022 Mere conduit service providers (Art. 12) are exempt from liability when the service provider is only passively involved in the transmission of data (i.e interconnection to the internet provided by traditional internet service providers and network operators), and,\u2022 Caching providers (Art. 13) are exempt from liability when they temporarily and automatically store data in order to make transmission more efficient (e.g proxy server) and if several technical conditions for storing the information are met (e.g local copy identical to original), and,\u2022 Hosting providers (Art. 14) are exempt from liability when those companies storing data for their users (e.g webhosting) do not know that they host illegal activity or information and act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the illegal information.The E-commerce Directive takes a horizontal approach to the liability of 'information society service providers'. That means that, when the conditions are fulfilled, the EU legislation exempts the online intermediaries from a wide array of liabilities including contractual liability, administrative liability, tortious (delictual) or extra-contractual liability, penal liability, civil liability or any other type of liability, for all types of activities initiated by third parties, including copyright and trademark infringements, defamation, misleading advertising, unfair commercial practices, unfair competition, publications of illegal content, etc.6 In so doing, a balance between the different interests at stake (e.g citizens, creators, right holders) must be struck in designing the liability rules.7 As a result, the liability rules intend to simultaneously prevent the illegal handling of information on the internet and to ensure the respect of EU fundamental rights (e.g freedom of expression, personal data protection, property rights, freedom to conduct business).1.3 Duties of care and notice and take down obligationsUnder the safe harbour regimes, online intermediaries are immune from liability unless they are aware of the illegality and are not acting adequately to stop it. A conceptual distinction8 between online intermediaries' 'passive' or 'active' role was developed by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the basis of Recital 42 of the E-commerce Directive, which reads:The exemptions from liability established in this Directive cover only cases where the activity of the information society service provider is limited to the technical process of operating and giving access to a communication network over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored, for the sole purpose of making the transmission more efficient; this activity is of a mere technical, automatic and passive nature, which implies that the information society service provider has neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is transmitted or stored.According to the CJEU case law in Google France9 and in L'Oreal,10 the tolerable level of passiveness depends on the intermediaries' roles.6 See European Commission, EU study on the legal analysis of a single market for the information society: New rules for a new age?, 2014.7 Recital 41.8 For an overview, see Institute for Information Law Study for the European Commission, Hosting Intermediary Services and Illegal Content Online, IViR Report for the European Commission, 2018.9 See joined cases, Google France SARL and Google Inc. v Louis Vuitton Malletier SA (C-236/08), Google France SARL v Viaticum SA and Luteciel SARL (C-237/08) and Google France SARL v Centre national de recherche en relations humaines (CNRRH) SARL and Others (C-238/08).10 See Case C-324/09 L\u2019Or\u00e9al SA and Others v eBay International AG and Others.Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries3Intermediaries such as 'mere conduit' service providers (Article 12) and 'caching' providers (Article 13) have mostly a passive role and no or limited knowledge about the user content they convey. 'Mere conduit' providers are not liable for the content they convey, as long as they do not initiate the transmission, nor select the receiver or select or modify the information contained in the transmission. 'Caching' providers are also not liable for the automatic, intermediate and temporary storage of information they implement to make information transmission more efficient.To the contrary, 'hosting providers' (Article 14) play a more active role, with more control over the content they host. They are therefore subject to more stringent 'duties of care' and 'notice and take down' obligations. First, hosting providers are not liable when they do not have 'actual knowledge' of illegal activity or information and are not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent. What constitutes 'illegal activities' has, however, not been defined precisely in the E-commerce Directive. Second, hosting providers must 'act expeditiously to remove' (i.e take down) or to 'disable access' (i.e block) illegal activity or information of which they have obtained actual knowledge. Hosting service providers can benefit from a liability exemption only if those two conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, the directive does not affect the possibility for Member States to require service providers who host information to apply duties of care under national law to detect and prevent illegal activities. Intermediaries can be subject to injunctive reliefs (i.e court orders) when they are found to be in breach of specific pieces of legislation (e.g copyright law).11Member States cannot impose a general obligation to monitor when they implement their duty of care obligation (Article 15). Instead, in order to implement 'duties of care' and 'notice and take down' obligations, the E-commerce Directive asks Member States to encourage voluntary agreements for removing and disabling access to illegal information (Recital 40). Different legal instruments have been set in this regard. Voluntary codes of conduct for internet service providers have been adopted in several Member States (e.g the Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK)). At EU level, the European Commission concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the sale of counterfeit goods on the internet,12 with major internet platforms and rights holders, to fight intellectual property rights (IPR) infringement. This voluntary agreement aims to prevent offers of counterfeit goods from appearing on online marketplaces. Furthermore, in recent years, the Commission has adopted a number of soft-law instruments encouraging hosting providers to engage in voluntary monitoring, including a Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online,13 the 2017 Communication on Tackling Illegal Content14 and the 2018 Recommendation on Measures to Effectively Tackle Illegal Content Online.1511 See OpenForumEurope, Intermediaries liabilities through the backdoor, 2016, at p 6 and 7.12 See Memorandum of Understanding on the sale of counterfeit goods via the internet, European Commission, 2016.13 See The EU Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, European Commission, 2016.14 See COM(2017) 555 final.15 See C(2018) 1177 final.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service42. Implementation gaps and calls for reform of the E-commerce DirectiveVarious studies and public consultations16 demonstrate large variances in the way the E-commerce Directive has been implemented throughout the EU and national jurisprudence on liability regimes remain very fragmented. Academics also point to persisting legal uncertainty regarding the application of existing national norms and conflicting court rulings between Member States and even within the same jurisdiction.17 Several implementation gaps have been identified in this respect.2.1 Definition of 'information society service' is unclearOne of the key questions is to what extent the new type of online services that have appeared since the adoption of the directive fall within the definition of an 'information society service' that is the sine qua non condition to benefit from the liability exemption. The case law both at national and European levels shows that divergences persist among Member States in many respects.18While the E-commerce Directive provides that the liability exemption is applicable to services 'normally provided for remuneration', it is unclear if it applies to 'activities sponsored by advertisements', to 'entirely free models' (e.g Wikipedia) and to 'freemium models' (i.e when users make free use of a service and only some of them pay some kind of remuneration).19 In France, the Paris Court of Appeal ruled in favour of the Wikimedia Foundation,20 defending the Foundation's status as a hosting provider. However, the CJEU found that online publishers of news could be liable for defamatory comments and illegal material published on their website, regardless of whether the content is free or paid for by users, where the platform receives income generated by advertisement.21The national legislation and jurisprudence on liability regimes for hyperlinks and search engines is also very fragmented. A UK court considered hyperlinking to be a mere conduit activity (falling under Art. 12) while a German court considered it to be a form of hosting (falling under Art. 14).22 Spain and Portugal have extended the liability exemption by law to hyperlinking and as well as search engine activities.23 It is also open to discussion whether the E-commerce liability exemptions apply to blockchain participants,24 while the fact that providers providing cloud computing services16 See European Commission, E-commerce Directive, 2020.17 See C. Angelopoulos, Beyond the safe harbours: harmonising substantive intermediary liability for copyright infringement in Europe, Intellectual Property Quarterly, 2013, 3, 253-274. See also I. Garrote Fernandez-Diez, Comparative analysis on national approaches to the liability of internet intermediaries for infringement of copyright and related rights, 2014.18 For an overview, see S. Stalla-Bourdillon, Internet Intermediaries as Responsible Actors? Why It Is Time to Rethink the E-Commerce Directive as Well, 2017.19 For example, to get more storage capacity.20 See M. Paulson and J. Rogers, Victory in France: Court rules in favor of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikimedia Foundation, 2016.21 See Case 291/13 Pappasavvas.22 See European Commission, Summary of the results of the Public Consultation on the future of electronic commerce in the Internal Market and the implementation of the Directive on electronic commerce (2000/31/EC), 2010.23 Ibid.24 See J. Schroers, Can blockchain participants use the e-Commerce Directive's liability exemptions?, KU Leuven CiTiP, 2019.Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries5(e.g Google Drive, Apple iCloud, Dropbox) are sometimes considered as hosting providers, has been criticised.25Furthermore, several academic studies have highlighted the uncertainties surrounding the application of the E-commerce Directive to social media companies and collaborative platforms.26 The CJEU has recently ruled in different ways on the question of whether the service provided by Airbnb and Google must be classified as an 'information society service'. In its 2017 Uber case,27 the CJEU decided that Uber does not classify as an 'information society service' subject to the liability rules in the E-commerce Directive but rather as a 'service in the field of transport'. In Airbnb Ireland,28 however, the Court held that the services provided by Airbnb Ireland (consisting of connecting, via an online platform, potential guests with hosts offering accommodation to rent) fall within the definition of an 'information society service'. Following the Court's reasoning, the classification as an 'information society service' depended on the degree of control that the platform had over the service provided. The lesser the degree of control, the greater the likelihood of being classified as an information society service. However, some experts stress that the e-commerce harmonisation regime is incomplete as it leaves the question of liability for collaborative economy intermediary activities to be settled under relevant national legislation.29 In addition, CJEU jurisprudence being complex and case specific, there is a risk that national courts will interpret such jurisprudence in different ways, which could result in legal fragmentation throughout the EU.302.2 Safe harbour conditions and notice and take down obligations are unclearUnder the E-commerce Directive, the hosting company has to act 'expeditiously' to remove or to disable access to the unlawful content upon obtaining 'actual knowledge' of 'illegal content or activities'. However several flaws have been identified.First, the notions underpinning the safe harbours regime lack clarity. There is no definition of what constitutes 'illegal activities' and no definition of 'actual knowledge'. Depending the implementation path chosen in the Member States, online intermediaries are exempted from liability on different grounds (e.g if they have knowledge of illegal content, through a court order or a notice, or via general awareness). Furthermore the concepts of 'passive' and 'active' role developed by the CJEU and the reasoning of the Court as regards the requirements of 'control' and 'awareness', lacks clarity.3125 See R. Weber, D. Staiger, Cloud Computing: A cluster of complex liability issues, European Journal of Current Legal Issues, 2014.26 See Providers Liability: From the eCommerce Directive to the future, Policy Department for economic and scientific policy, Directorate-General for Internal Policies, European Parliament, 2017.

Gasparotti, Liability for illegal content online: Weaknesses of the EU legal framework and possible plans of the EU Commission to address them in a \u201cDigital Services Act\u201d, CEP study, March 2020.30 See A. Hoffmann and A. Gasparotti, above.31 See S. Stalla-Bourdillon, Internet Intermediaries as Responsible Actors? Why It Is Time to Rethink the E-Commerce Directive as Well, 2017.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service6Second, there are considerable differences both with regard to the definition and the functioning of notice-and-takedown throughout the EU. With regard to the definition of notice and take down mechanisms, Member States have set up different systems including a 'notice and take down' system (i.e the illegal content must be removed), a 'notice and stay down' system (i.e the illegal content must be removed and cannot be re-uploaded), or a 'notice and notice system' (i.e a system in which the hosting provider is only supposed to forward the notification of infringement to the alleged infringer). Some Member States have set no notice and take down mechanisms. This heterogeneity of models across the EU leads to great legal uncertainty for internet intermediaries.32With regard to the implementation of notice and take down mechanisms, some Member States require a formal procedure and official notification by judicial authorities, while others only require notification from the right-holder to assume the service provider has 'knowledge' of the illegal content. Also, there is no common understanding of what comprises 'expeditious' action to remove or to disable access to the illegal information. As a result, the timeframe for intervention varies greatly, for instance under the EU Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online, which requires action by the platform in less than 24 hours after being notified, whereas the Dutch notice and take down Code of Conduct mentions the need for such an action within 5 working days following notification, provided the content is not manifestly unlawful or punishable.33Furthermore, the E-commerce Directive does not harmonise the procedural safeguards and only a few Member States have implemented counter notice procedures enabling the customers to challenge a request to take down allegedly illegal material.342.3 Duty of care regime and prohibition on general monitoring are unclearArticle 15 of the E-commerce Directive prohibits Member States from imposing on online intermediaries a general obligation to monitor information that they transmit or store. However, the prohibition refers solely to monitoring of a general nature and does not concern monitoring obligations in a specific case. In fact, in line with national legislation, national courts can impose injunctions on online intermediaries in order to prevent particular infringements (e.g for instance to enable plaintiffs to enforce their copyright).35 This requires a certain degree of monitoring. However, since the directive does not specify what the duty of care obligations envisaged in national laws to detect and prevent illegal activities entail, the boundary between duties of care and general monitoring is not clear and differentiating 'general' monitoring from 'specific' monitoring obligation is problematic.36The lack of legal certainty concerning monitoring of online content is reinforced by the fact that large online platforms often have automated filtering systems. These measures are implemented based on Recital 40 of the E-commerce Directive, which states that the liability rules do not prevent the development and operation of technical systems of protection and identification and of technical surveillance instruments made possible by digital technology. However, the question as32 See I. Garrote Fernandez-Diez, above.33 See Institute for Information Law Study for the European Commission, above.34 See European Commission, EU study on the legal analysis of a single market for the information society: New rules for a new age?, 2014.35 Ibid.36 See A. Kuczerawy, To Monitor or Not to Monitor? The Uncertain Future of Article 15 of the E-Commerce Directive, KU Leuven CiTiP, 2019.Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries7to whether such proactive measures by online intermediaries to detect and remove illegal content may result in conducting a general monitoring is unlawful under the E-commerce Directive has been discussed (See Box 1 below).Box 1 \u2013 CJEU case law on general monitoringIn Scarlet v SABAM (2011)37 and in SABAM v Netlog (2012),38 the CJEU ruled that requiring an internet service provider (such as Scarlet, which transmits information over communication networks), or an online social network (such as Netlog, which stores information provided by the users on its servers), to carry out general monitoring and install filtering systems to prevent copyright infringements is illegal pursuant to 15(1) of the E-commerce Directive. However, the judgments do not preclude national judges from imposing narrower filter obligations. In UPC Telekabel Wien (2014),39 the CJEU ruled that, based on a court injunction, an internet service provider could block its customers' access to a website that places materials in breach of copyright law.The CJEU case law requires that a balance is struck between the preventive measures imposed on technical intermediaries and the applicable fundamental rights that would be affected.40 National courts must therefore carefully consider fundamental rights and proportionality before any monitoring, filtering or blocking order is made. The companies' freedom to conduct business and the users' right to privacy and the freedom of information must be ensured. However, the CJEU case law is not clear where the balance should lie between the rights of internet users, internet service providers and rights holders.41In the recent Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek v Facebook Ireland case (2019),42 the ECJ was asked to clarify the scope of the obligations that might be imposed on a host provider under the E-commerce Directive. The Court ruled that a social network platform operator, such as Facebook, could be ordered to find and delete comments identical to an illegal defamatory comment, as well as equivalent comments from the same user. According to some experts, this ruling opens the door to obligations being imposed on platforms to proactively monitor content.43 Furthermore, it has been stressed that such an approach would be difficult to implement in practice without also entailing a general monitoring obligation to be performed by the online intermediary.443. Revision of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries3.1 Context of the forthcoming digital services actThe European Commission has conducted various assessments of the E-commerce Directive since 2010, with a view to investigating the necessity for its amendment.

The Court delivered its MTE and Index.hu judgment, concerning the liability of online intermediaries for user comments considered to be hate speech, in 2016.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service8Commission focused its efforts on developing a harmonised framework for EU 'notice-and-action' procedures.45 Then, in its 2012 Communication, A coherent framework to build trust in the digital single market for e-commerce and online services,46 the Commission acknowledged that despite the guarantees offered by the E-commerce Directive, intermediary internet service providers were facing legal uncertainty given the fragmentation of the applicable rules in the EU. The Commission advocated, however, maintaining the liability regime under the E-Commerce Directive while encouraging self-regulatory efforts by platforms.47The European Parliament called for clarity on the liability of online intermediaries, given the flaws in enforcement and called for new guidance to enable online platforms to better comply with their responsibilities.48 However, instead of launching a revision of the E-commerce Directive, the Commission made the choice to carve out targeted instruments to address specific forms of illegal online content instead. As a result, in recent years, sector-specific legislation has been passed to increase the obligations of online intermediaries to fight sexual abuse online,49 copyright infringement in the context of user generated content uploaded on large platforms50 and tackle hate speech and violence in the content provided by video-sharing platform providers,51 while a new regulation on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online is still being discussed.52Under the new leadership of President von der Leyen, the European Commission finally committed to upgrading the Union's liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products, with a new digital services act (DSA).53 The new Commission work programme announced that a draft of the DSA and clearer rules on the transparency, behaviour and accountability of online intermediaries who act as gatekeepers to information and data flows will be released in the fourth quarter of 2020, or early 2021.543.2 Proposals for reform: Theoretical frameworkThe E-commerce Directive as it currently stands does not harmonise the conditions for holding intermediaries liable, but instead only the conditions for exempting online intermediaries from liability. Given the gaps identified in section 2 above, academics and experts have discussed extensively how to reform the liability regime. Proposals vary from clarifying the current regime of exemption of liabilities to creating secondary liabilities for online intermediaries. The different scenarios require different types of intervention, ranging from strengthening self-regulation to co-regulation and from a limited harmonisation of substantive law to a more comprehensive harmonisation of substantive law. Some of the most recent proposals are listed below:45 See A. Kuczerawy, Intermediary liability &amp; freedom of expression: Recent developments in the EU notice &amp; action initiative, Computer Law &amp; Security Review, 2015.46 See COM(2011) 942 final.47 The European Commission adopted a Recommendation on measures to effectively tackle illegal content online (C(2018) 1177 final) and supported the development of the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation on 1 March 2018.48 See European Parliament resolution of 15 June 2017 on online platforms and the digital single market, 2016/2276(INI).49 See Directive 2011/93/EU on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children.50 See Directive 2019/790 on copyright and related rights in the digital single market.51 See Directive 2018/1808 on the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.52 See COM(2018) 640 final. The text has been adopted by Parliament and is now awaiting its first reading by the Council.53 See Ursula von der Leyen, A Union that strives for more \u2013 My Agenda for Europe, 2019. See also the mission letter to Margrethe Vestager and mission letter to Thierry Breton, European Commission, 2019.54 See Annex 1 of the European Commission work programme, 2020.Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries9\u2022 Helberg and others55 have proposed setting up a framework of cooperative responsibility for online platforms. This would require defining the essential public values at play in particular economic and societal activities and develop, through a multi-stakeholder process, commonly agreed regulations, codes of conduct, terms of use and technologies (e.g 'by design').\u2022 Smet and Angelopoulous56 suggest moving away from the traditional horizontal approach of the EU's safe harbour regime, towards a more vertical approach to online liabilities, under which distinct actions would be tailored to diverse wrong-doings, e.g notice-and-notice for copyright, notice-wait-and-takedown for defamation and notice-and-takedown and notice-and-suspension for hate speech.\u2022 Satore57 argues that there is a need to introduce EU rules on secondary liability (i.e , liability for the illegal activities of their users), covering all kinds of illegal activities that are enabled by the intermediaries. According to his conclusions, the exemption from secondary liability should cover all main intermediaries, including search engines and collaborative platforms as well 'active' intermediaries, as long as their engagement with the activities of their users pertains to their intermediation service. Furthermore, the scope of the duty of care obligation should be specified for different kinds of user activities (e.g expressive communications between users, the sending of advertisements, economic exchanges, the distribution of malicious software, etc.).\u2022 To the contrary, a study for the European Parliament58 suggests there is no pressing need for reform of the E-commerce Directive because its provisions are sufficiently flexible to adopt to new business models, which also make them generally future proof. According to the study prepared for the Parliament, ECJ case law will answer the remaining open legal questions still open, and instead proposes a sector-specific approach for setting the liability rules applicable to online intermediaries.\u2022 De Streel, Buiten and Peitz59 favour, as a first best option, carving out a negligence-based system based on an economic analysis of liability rules. Accordingly, the duty of care of the providers of hosting services could be determined on the basis of a set of general criteria (e.g instruments available to prevent harm, social costs of precautionary measures, the type and the extent of the harm, the social benefits that the activities of online hosting platforms provide to society, etc.), and differentiated according to the type of illegal material. However, given the political and legal difficulties raised by the harmonisation of national liabilities rules, they instead recommend an approach clarifying hosting providers' liability conditions at EU level. Overall, EU rules should incentivise intermediaries and users to detect illegality, while minimising the risks and the costs of errors and safeguarding a balance between the different human rights at stake.55 See N. Helberg, J. Pierson, and T. Poell, Governing online platforms: From contested to cooperative responsibility, The Information Society, 34(1), 2018, p.1-14.56 See C. Angelopoulos and S. Smet, Notice-and-fair-balance: how to reach a compromise between fundamental rights in European intermediary liability, Journal of Media Law, 2016. Going further towards full harmonisation, Angelopoulos also proposed the adoption of a European Civil Code or a European Tort Code replacing national contracts and tort law, which will provide a harmonised legal basis for addressing the internet intermediaries' liability. Nevertheless, this option, requiring a full harmonisation of substantive law, seems unlikely to come about given the fact that it would also raise sensitive issues of subsidiarity and proportionality (see C.J Angelopoulos, European intermediary liability in copyright: A tort-based analysis, Institute for Information Law, 2016).57 See Providers Liability: From the eCommerce Directive to the future, Policy Department for economic and scientific policy, Directorate-General for Internal Policies, European Parliament, 2017, p.29 58 See Liability of Online Service Providers for Copyrighted Content \u2013 Regulatory Action Needed?, Policy Department for economic and scientific policy, Directorate-General for Internal Policies, European Parliament, 2018.59 See A. de Streel, M. Buiten, M. Peitz, Liability of Online Hosting Platforms \u2013 should exceptionalism end?, CERRE, 2018.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service103.3 Proposals for reform: Policy questionsIndependently of the chosen approach, EU policy-makers will have to address a range of questions, some of which are listed below:603.3.1 Scope of the liability regimeOne of the fundamental questions policy-makers are facing is how to define the scope of a revised liability regime. Several issues would need to be considered, in particular, the opportunity to address both 'illegal' and 'harmful' content, dis- and misinformation ('fake news') and online advertisements under the revised liability regime for online intermediaries.61i. Illegal and potentially harmful contentThe current liability regime addresses only 'illegal content', but as highlighted above, the E-commerce Directive does not provide a precise definition of this notion. 'Illegal content' arguably encompasses a large variety of content categories that are not compliant with EU and national legislation, including on online violations of copyright, trademark and trade secrets; counterfeiting and unauthorised parallel distribution via the internet; on consumer protection violations, privacy, libel and defamation law violations; data protection violations; hate speech and incitement to violence (e.g terrorism content); and child sexual abuse material and disclosure of private sexual images without consent ('revenge porn').62In contrast, potentially 'harmful content' refers to content which often does not strictly fall under the prohibition of a law, but might nevertheless have harmful effects. A wide range of content potentially falls into this category including harassment arising from social media and messaging services such as bullying, publication of information covered by freedom of speech but which could have a detrimental impact and disinformation content, mis- or disinformation ('fake news') that may hamper the ability of citizens to take informed decisions.63Harmful content (which is not illegal) does not fall under the E-commerce Directive liability regime so far. However, the EU has recently adopted a range of self-regulatory measures to better control online platform behaviour, in particular the disinformation phenomenon prompted by the use of social media (see below). Furthermore, the EU has attempted to address specific harmful content by way of targeted legislation such as the proposed regulation on preventing the dissemination of terrorist content online that is being discussed by EU legislators that carves out a mandatory duty of care obligation for all platforms to ensure they are not misused for online dissemination of terrorist content.64In the context of the reform of the E-commerce Directive, some academics stress that the current policy approach in the European Union should shift from intermediary liability to intermediary responsibility and support a liability regime for online intermediaries addressing both 'illegal' and60 In addition, the interplay of the liability regimes with other EU rules will need to be considered, including consumer protection, data protection and competition rules.61 Other issues will need to be addressed. For an in-depths analysis see A. Hoffmann and A. Gasparotti, above. They call in particular for assessment of the need to extend the scope of the liability rules to service providers established in a third country.62 See Institute for Information Law Study for the European Commission, above.63 See A. Hoffmann and A. Gasparotti, above. See the proposed taxonomy by L. Woods and W. Perrin, Online harm reduction \u2013 a statutory duty of care and regulator, Carnegie Trust UK, 2019.64 The text has been adopted by Parliament and is now awaiting its first reading by the Council.Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries11'harmful' content.65 In this way, some national law-makers are considering differentiating what action is expected from online providers in response to illegal content and activity from action expected from them to tackle potentially harmful conduct that may not be illegal, such as online bullying or intimidation in public life.66 Such an approach is also favoured by large online platforms, who have called for the adoption of a two-fold EU framework that would clearly distinguish between the principles of responsibility and liability.67However, a difficult point is that this approach requires distinguishing what is 'illegal content' online from content which is 'harmful' but not illegal, while the concept of 'harmful' is subjective, depends greatly on context and can vary considerably between Member States.68 Furthermore, fundamental rights defenders argue that introducing rules to address online harmful content into EU law would have grave consequences for freedom of expression, freedom to seek information, and other fundamental rights and therefore seek to strictly limit the scope of the digital services act to illegal content.69 Setting a robust framework and ensuring legal certainty will rest on defining precise concepts that comply with EU fundamental rights principles.ii. Disinformation and 'fake news'The EU has so far supported a self-regulatory approach to fight the disinformation phenomenon and the spread of 'fake news' online. The European Commission supported the development of the EU Code of Practice on disinformation which has been signed voluntarily by leading platforms such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla or Twitter, which submitted to transparent self-regulation.70 However, despite their efforts, the ability of the online platforms to contain the spread of misleading information, for instance in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, has been questioned. As a result, some are calling to reassess the current self-regulatory framework.71In addition, at national level, several Members States have already designed specific national legislation to strengthen compliance rules for social network providers.72 In Germany,73 the 2017 law on improving law enforcement in social networks imposes that social networks such as Facebook or Twitter fight unlawful content including hate crime or false messages posted on social network platforms and that they block access to 'manifestly unlawful' content, as well as content that is 'not obviously illegal'. In France,74 a law on 'fake news'75 was passed in 2017 and a draft law is under discussion on blocking access to content within 24 hours of receipt of a complaint regarding65 See L. Woods and W. Perrin, above. In the same way, see also J. Bayer, Between Anarchy and Censorship Public discourse and the duties of social media, May 2019.66 See UK Online Harms White Paper - Initial consultation response, February 2020.67 See EdiMA, Responsibility Online, 2020.68 See EDRi, More responsibility to online platforms \u2013 but at what cost?, 19 July 2019.69 Ibid. EDRi states: 'While the definition of what is illegal is decided as part of the democratic process in our societies, it is unclear which content should be considered 'harmful' and who makes that call. Moreover, the term 'harmful' lacks a legal definition, is vague and its meaning often varies depending on the context, time, and people involved. The term should therefore not form the basis for lawful restrictions on freedom of expression under European human rights law.'70 See EU Code of Practice on Disinformation, European Commission, June 2019.71 See E. Shattock, Is it time for Europe to reassess internet intermediary liability in light of coronavirus misinformation?, European Law Blog, April 2020. The Instagram social network changed its policy in order to provide its users with credible information on the coronavirus pandemic and expand its efforts to remove potentially harmful misinformation. Nevertheless numerous false and misleading stories have thrived on digital platforms.72 For an overview see A. Hoffmann and A. Gasparotti above.73 See Bundesministerium der Justiz und f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz, Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, April 2020.74 See Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, Proposition de loi visant \u00e0 lutter contre les contenus haineux sur internet, January 2020.75 See LOI n\u00b0 2018-1202 du 22 d\u00e9cembre 2018 relative \u00e0 la lutte contre la manipulation de l'information.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service12content reported as 'patently illegal'. This trends creates a risk of legal fragmentation, while online platforms are de facto providing services on an EU-wide scale.Against this background, some experts support amendment of the current EU liability regime. One proposal is to define a separate category of service providers in the E-commerce Directive that should not be liable for third-party content and not be obliged to monitor third-party content \u2013 since they cannot decide on the legal or illegal quality of content \u2013 but should be responsible for administrating their platforms in full respect of a set of specific obligations (e.g maintain ideologically neutral services, create algorithms fostering and promoting diversity of content, ensure transparency of their algorithms and offer options to users in selecting their settings for content, including diversity and the option to identify and disable fake accounts).76 In the same way, platform providers could be granted immunity for content in a similar way as for hosting providers and be made responsible for the activities that they actually perform, such as facilitation, dissemination or profiling.77 Taking account of the changing audiovisual and media ecosystem, some stakeholders strongly support the enactment of new online liability rules proposed under the forthcoming digital services act, for tackling the online disinformation phenomenon properly.78However, the adequacy and effectiveness of imposing hard law content moderation to control disinformation has been met with scepticism. It has been stressed that setting such EU legislation to protect freedom of expression may be premature and potentially detrimental with regard to fundamental rights.79 Concerns have been expressed that command and control regulation would not achieve meaningful results in the field of 'fake news' and that imposing rigid solutions could amount to censorship.80iii. Online advertisementThe related question of whether the spreading of false or misleading online advertisements should fall in the scope of the revised liability regime has also been raised. The possibility to hold platforms liable for abuses of social endorsement mechanisms and require them to take down infringing content could be considered.81 Other intrusive measures such as requiring platform providers to identify advertisers and enable users to access this information and maintain a searchable repository of political and issue-based advertising targeting persons in the EU has been proposed.82 Against this background, some policy-makers have called for a revision of EU legislation in order to mandate platforms to actively monitor the advertisements shown on their sites and to establish a different set of rules for advertisements for commercial products and services and advertisements of a political nature.83 Furthermore, the necessity of requiring online platforms to76 See Disinformation and propaganda \u2013 impact on the functioning of the rule of law in the EU and its Member States, Policy Department for Citizens' Rights and Constitutional Affairs, Directorate General for Internal Policies of the Union, European Parliament, 2019.77 See J. Bayer, Between Anarchy and Censorship Public discourse and the duties of social media, CEPS, May 2019.78 For instance, see Association of Commercial Television in Europe press release, 16 April 2020.79 See STOA, Regulating disinformation with artificial intelligence, European Parliamentary Research Service, European Parliament, 2019.80 See The legal framework to address 'fake news': possible policy actions at the EU level, Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies, Directorate-General for Internal Policies, European Parliament, 2018.81 See European Commission, Behavioural Study on Advertising and Marketing Practices in Online Social Media, 2018.82 See Disinformation and propaganda \u2013 impact on the functioning of the rule of law in the EU and its Member States,, above.83 See Draft Opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for the Committee on Legal Affairs with recommendations to the Commission on Digital services act: adapting commercial and civil law rules for commercialReform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries13put effective and appropriate safeguards in place to tackle the appearance of advertisements for unsafe products could be further investigated.84iv. Differentiating liability rules for small and large intermediariesThe current liability rules apply to all information society services regardless of their market status or market power. The possibility to define a set of supplementary obligations imposed on large intermediaries, given their large or significant market status, has been identified.85 The Copyright Directive gives an example of such differentiation of obligations, as it imposes stringent obligations on online service providers whose main purpose is to store and provide public access to a 'large amount of copyright-protected works'. However, such an approach has been criticised because the notion of 'large amount' creates considerable uncertainty, leaving it to the courts to define its scope.86 In addition, any adverse changes to the liability regime \u2013 such as increased legal obligations on online intermediaries \u2013 could have a handicapping effect on innovation and the activity of online intermediaries.87 The guiding factors in differentiating obligations for small and large intermediaries would therefore need to be based on precise legal concepts and their economic impacts properly assessed.3.3.2 Clarifying safe harbour conditionsExperts and stakeholders call for revision of the E-commerce Directive primarily to clarify several legal notions which underpin the safe harbour regime and in particular the definition of 'information society service providers' and the difference between 'active' role and 'passive' role. Furthermore, the possibility of imposing algorithm transparency and neutrality in order to grant liability/responsibility immunity for online intermediaries should be assessed.i. Definition of information society service providersBecause the liability regime potentially applies to a much larger variety of services than was the case at the time of its adoption in 2000, the definition of 'information society service providers' would need to be amended to cover new categories of providers whose liability could be triggered.88 A revised definition could clarify whether new digital services providers (such as cloud infrastructures, content distribution network, search engines, social networks and media-sharing platforms, online advertising services, digital services built on electronic contracts and distributed ledgers such as blockchain), or collaborative economy platforms (such as AirBnB and Uber) and online marketplaces (used to provided legal but also illegal and counterfeit products), could or could not benefit from a safe harbour regime.entities operating online (2020/2019(INL)), Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, European Parliament, 2020.84 See Draft report on addressing product safety in the single market (2019/2190(INI)), Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, European Parliament, April 2020.85 See A. Hoffmann and A. Gasparotti above. See also the recent draft opinion of the European Parliament Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the digital services act and fundamental rights issues posed (2020/2022(INI)). The text stresses that 'SMEs and large players have differing capabilities with regard to the moderation of content; warns that overburdening businesses with disproportionate new obligations could further hinder the growth of SMEs and require recourse to automatic filtering tools, which may often lead to the removal of legal content'.86 See T. Spoerri, On Upload-Filters and other Competitive Advantages for Big Tech Companies under Article 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, JIPITEC \u2013 Journal of Intellectual Property, Information Technology and E-Commerce Law, 2019.87 See Copenhagen Economics, Online Intermediaries: Impact on the EU economy, EDiMA, 2015.88 See C. Del Federico, Intermediary liability. The 'Achilles\u2019 heel' of the current legislation: the courts. A comparative analysis with the US, focusing on copyright infringement, 2015.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service14ii. Difference between 'active' and 'passive' rolesThe difference between 'active' role and 'passive' role could be clarified for a range of new activities including distribution and processing of third-party data, networking (i.e connecting users), collaboration (i.e allowing multiple users to access and edit stored data), matchmaking (i.e linking supply and demand), indexation (i.e searchable index) and ranking services (i.e ranking mechanisms) under the EU liability regime.89 Some experts stress that the differentiation of the active/passive role is questionable and complicated for collaborative economy services (such as AirBnB, Uber). They propose alternatively using more appropriate concepts, building on notions such as whether the providers have 'editorial functions', 'actual knowledge' and a 'certain degree of control', which would be more precisely delimited under EU legislation and case law.90Also a shift from today's merely ex-post control (i.e imposition of injunction reliefs only once detection of illegal conduct has been established) to a more stringent ex-ante control (i.e ex-ante monitoring of online content) to better control the digital platforms increasingly acting as 'digital gatekeepers' could be considered.91 The choice between ex-ante and ex-post control will be particularly relevant for framing the policy discussion on algorithm transparency and neutrality.iii. Algorithm transparency and neutralityThe possibility of imposing a new set of obligations to grant liability/responsibility immunity to online intermediaries over misinformation and/or online advertisements has been discussed (see above). Should the EU legislator choose this path, the question of ensuring algorithm transparency and neutrality will become central.It has been proposed, inter alia, to oblige platforms to ensure their algorithms do not systematically favour any political, ideological or religious opinion, or give preference to content that is their own or produced by an affiliated company. Furthermore, following the model of the algorithm transparency requirements imposed by the recent regulation on online platform-to-business relationships,92 online users could be offered more control, such as the possibility to prioritise content that is found to be trustworthy by independent news organisations.933.3.3 Revisiting the notice and take down regimesSeveral proposals have been made to amend the notice and take down regimes implemented in the EU today. Different notice and take down regimes could be set depending on the type of liability at stake, i.e breach of criminal law (e.g child sexual abuse) and civil law (e.g copyright).94 An alternative proposal is to move from the horizontal approach of the EU's safe harbour regime, towards a more vertical approach with a calibrated system of notice and action, aiming to achieve viable compromises between conflicting fundamental rights in cases of intermediary liability. Distinct 'actions' tailored to diverse wrongdoings, e.g notice and notice for copyright, notice wait89 See Institute for Information Law Study for the European Commission, above.90 See A. Hoffmann and A. Gasparotti, above.91 For an overview on this line of thinking see P. Alexiadis and A. de Streel, Designing an EU Intervention Standard for Digital Platforms, EUI Working Papers, RSCAS 2020/14. See also E. Laidlaw, Internet Gatekeepers, Human Rights and Corporate Social Responsibilities, London School of Economics, 2012. For some first proposals in this area see European Parliament, Report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Digital Services Act, (2020/2018(INL)), April 2020.92 See Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services.93 See J. Bayer and others above.94 See EDRi response to the Consultation on Clean and Open Internet, 2015.Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries15and take down for defamation and notice and take down and notice and suspension for hate speech.95However, a pure self-regulation approach has been very much criticised. The voluntary codes of conduct developed by online intermediaries, either ex-post (i.e content removal, account termination or personal data disclosure procedures), or ex-ante (i.e content filtering), raise serious human rights objections and suffer from a 'democratic deficit' since consumer and citizen involvement is limited.96 The adoption of a more detailed notice and take down regime \u2013 based on the model of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States of America (USA) \u2013 which describes in detail the legal effect of triggering the notice and take down regime and includes procedural rules, could be a more appropriate approach.97 Furthermore, it has been stressed that setting up a detailed and harmonised European notice and take down procedure would provide more legal certainty.983.3.4 Automated filtering measures and general monitoringThe prohibition of a general monitoring obligation under the E-commerce Directive is regarded by most academics and commentators as a cornerstone of the EU online liability regime that must be maintained.99 However, while the current policy thinking in the EU is shifting from implementing intermediary liability to fostering intermediary responsibility, the principle prohibiting general monitoring is de facto being challenged100 by the use of automated filtering technologies.101Content recognition tools such as Rights Manager (Facebook) and Content ID (YouTube) already play a major role in copyright protection (See Box 2).102 Such automated measures have been enshrined or proposed in several pieces of legislation. Article 17 of the 2019 EU Copyright Directive places great emphasis on the adoption of such automatic filtering systems and such large platform automatic filters will likely become the new industry standard.103 The proposed regulation on terrorist content also specified that hosting service providers must, where appropriate, take proactive measures to protect their services against the dissemination of terrorist content, including by deploying automated detection tools.10495 See C. Angelopoulos and S. Smet, above.96 See See B Hugenholtz, Codes of Conduct and Copyright Enforcement in Cyberspace, in Copyright Enforcement and the Internet (ed. Stamatoudi), Kluwer Law International, 2010.97 See Ibid.98 See report from OpenForumEurope, Intermediaries liabilities through the backdoor, 2016. See also C. Del Federico above. See as well the draft report from the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs with recommendations to the Commission on a Digital Services Act, 2020/2019(INL). The draft report proposes to set a harmonised standard procedure for content moderation to follow throughout the Union.99 See A. de Streel, M. Buiten, M. Peitz, above.100 See A. Kuczerawy, To Monitor or Not to Monitor? The Uncertain Future of Article 15 of the E-Commerce Directive, KU Leuven CiTiP, 2019.101 Internet filters are content-control software that restrict or control the content an internet user can access, and determine what content will be available or be blocked. The filters' function is to recognise certain content, and then automatically delete it if required.102 See French High Council for Literary and artistic property, Report by the research mission on recognition tools for copyright-protected content on digital platforms, JIPITEC \u2013 Journal of Intellectual Property, Information Technology and E-Commerce Law, 2016. Google is reporting that 98 % of its copyright disputes are processed using Content ID, while only 2 % use the notice and take down procedure.103 See T. Spoerri, On Upload-Filters and other Competitive Advantages for Big Tech Companies under Article 17 of the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, JIPITEC \u2013 Journal of Intellectual Property, Information Technology and E-Commerce Law, 2019.104 See Article 6(1)).EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service16Against, this background, the question of mandating that online intermediaries use automated filtering technologies to establish illegal or harmful content will likely become a focus of the discussion on the revision of the E-commerce Directive.Box 2 \u2013 YouTube's Content ID filteringSource: Google.However, such measures present significant drawbacks, including a lack of transparency concerning how the technologies work, a lack of adequate procedural safeguards and a risk of over-enforcement, with online providers being more likely to apply an algorithm that takes down too much, rather than too little, content.105 Opponents stress above all that filtering algorithms make too many mistakes (i.e , false-positives), because they do not understand context, political activism, or satire, and require human review to prevent fundamental rights violations and discrimination.106Furthermore, experts warn that provision fostering the use of upload filters such as that enshrined in the Copyright Directive may indirectly result in general monitoring unless appropriate safeguards are provided.107 A pending ECJ case may provide some guidance in this respect (see Box 3 below). However, for greater legal certainty, the digital services act could also define precisely when the use of the automated measures should be imposed as a legal obligation for platforms, as well as the associated procedural safeguards and options for judicial redress.108105 See T. Riis and S. Schwemer, Leaving the European Safe Harbor, Sailing towards Algorithmic Content Regulation, Journal of Internet Law, Vol. 22, No 7, 2019, p. 1\u201321.106 See T.

This organisation, which defends the digital rights of users, stresses that the use of automated measures should be accepted only in limited cases of manifestly illegal content that is not context-dependant (e.g sexual abuse against minors).Reform of the EU liability regime for online intermediaries17Box 3 \u2013 Filtering systems and Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European UnionArticle 11 (Freedom of expression and information) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union109 provides that 'everyone has the right to freedom of expression', including 'freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers' and that 'the freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected'.According to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) Scarlet Extended110 and Netlog111 judgments, an order to implement filtering systems that remove legal content may violate the freedom of information pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Charter.In a pending case, Poland is challenging the legality of Article 17 of the Copyright Directive in the ECJ, on the grounds that the provisions imposing upload filters are contrary to Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as they de facto impose upon intermediaries that they automatically filter user uploads on their platforms.1123.3.5 Introduction of a 'Good Samaritan' clauseThe 'Good Samaritan paradox' refers to the fact that a hosting intermediary would be disincentivised from taking precautions against infringement for fear of losing safe harbour protection.113 In other words, the prohibition on playing an active role as a hosting provider may lead hosting providers to avoid making all necessary efforts to assess whether the content they host is illegal in order precisely to avoid being considered as playing an active role.There is controversy as to whether or not the E-Commerce Directive does contain a 'Good Samaritan' clause \u2013 based on the model of the USA Communications Decency Act114 \u2013 that protects online providers from civil liability in case voluntary screening or blocking measures are not efficient in completely restricting access to or availability of offensive content. In its 2017 Communication on tackling illegal content,115 the European Commission stresses that hosting providers falling under Article 14 of the E-commerce Directive will not be punished if they take proactive steps to detect, remove or disable access to illegal content (i.e 'Good Samaritan' actions). However, it has been stressed that the European Commission interpretation is somewhat confusing and misleading because online intermediaries in the EU cannot benefit from the liability exemption if they fail to remove the illegal content at stake.116 In the same way, a 2018 study stresses that, in the absence of a 'Good Samaritan' defence, hosting intermediaries are exposed to a higher risk of liability if they decide to be more active in addressing illegal content proactively.117To remedy this shortcoming, there are calls to explicitly include a 'good Samaritan' clause in the EU legislative framework. A specific provision could make clear that measures taken in line with Article109 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 2000/C 364/01.110 Case C\u201170/10.111 C\u2011360/10.112 See Case C-401/19.113 See P van Eecke, 'Online Service Providers and Liability: A Plea for a Balanced Approach', Common Market Law Review, 2011.114 See United States Congress, Communications Decency Act of 1995.115 See COM(2017) 555 final.116 See A. Kuczerawy, The EU Commission on voluntary monitoring: Good Samaritan 2.0 or Good Samaritan 0.5?, KU Leuven CiTiP, 2018.117 See Institute for Information Law Study for the European Commission, above.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service1813(1) should not deprive the intermediary from safe harbour protection.118 Introducing such a clause in EU law could reassure intermediaries that they will not be held liable for hosting illegal material of which they obtained knowledge through their voluntary, proactive monitoring efforts and may also avoid underinvestment by online intermediaries in setting proper mechanisms to find illegal material.119 Internet providers and large platforms support the adoption of a 'Good Samaritan clause' that extends protection from liability in cases where internet intermediaries have actual knowledge of allegedly illicit content when they apply in good faith procedures designed to tackle such content.120However, critics stress that such an amendment to Article 14 of the E-commerce Directive does not seem to be justified, since the case law shows that the courts do not hold platforms using Good Samaritan mechanisms to be liable.121 For instance, courts have not considered that the use of YouTube's Content ID led to YouTube playing an active role in the provision of its users' content. Such 'Good Samaritan' protection also presents some disadvantages, including the fact that it could encourage excessive take downs on the intermediary's own initiative.1223.3.6 Roles and powers of regulatorsThe need to ensure appropriate regulatory oversight of online intermediaries in the EU has been raised. Addressing the enforcement issues and institutional design are however uncharted territory, since the E-commerce Directive does not touch upon those issues. Harmonisation, or at the very least, approximation of national institutional and procedural rules would be useful to set up a more efficient common liability online regime applicable across the EU.The creation of new structures for regulating digital platforms (i.e central regulator, decentralised system, extension of the powers of existing regulatory authorities) and the definition of roles and powers granted to digital platform regulators (e.g powers to require additional information, complaint handling, power to impose fines or other corrective action, approval of codes of conduct), could be assessed in the context of the digital services act.123 Setting up an EU regulatory body leading the supervision has been proposed, to ensure oversight and enforcement of the new rules, in particular in complex cross-border situations where it is difficult to implement and enforce rules in an effective manner.124118 See C.

OutlookThere are strong arguments today for reforming the EU liability regime for online intermediaries. Several implementation gaps have been identified. Persisting legal uncertainty regarding the application of existing norms and conflicting court rulings have been highlighted. Technologies and business models have evolved in the last 20 years and the EU framework struggles to capture liability issues raised by new actors such as search engines, social networks or online marketplaces, while the European Court of Justice case law does not provide sufficient guidance. Furthermore, societal challenges have changed the nature and scale of the issue, with the development of a range of new harmful online practices such as the dissemination of terrorist content online, the increasing use of platforms to distribute counterfeit products and the spreading of false or misleading news and online advertisements. Against this background, there seems to be considerable support from academics, stakeholders and policy-makers for reform of the current EU liability regime. However, there is also strong disagreement on the way forward and on how to adapt the EU rules to the new digital environment. Different types of policy intervention, including strengthening self-regulation, fostering co-regulation and promoting a limited harmonisation of substantive law or a more comprehensive harmonisation of substantive law, will need to be addressed in the discussions of the forthcoming digital services act. A question which seems central to the debate is whether it is necessary to extend the scope of the EU legislation to encompass both 'illegal' and 'harmful' content \u2013 arguably including even 'online disinformation' and 'online advertisement'. The potential benefits of the policy intervention must be weighed against the risks for fundamental rights.EPRS European Parliamentary Research Service205.

The tools competition authorities can use to restore fair competition At a citizens\u2019 dialogue in Dublin (1), (2), (3), Commissioner Vestager said that the \u2018debate on whether Google search is an essential facility hasn\u2019t concluded yet\u2019, adding: \u2018the most urgent debate is about access to data\u2019 (4). Some big tech platform argue that people don\u2019t really care about privacy as they click all the cookies and pop-ups without reading the details because they want to stay online and continue using the App. However, Europe\u2019s data protection regulators have received more than 95 000 complaints (5) about possible data breaches, eight months after the adoption of a landmark EU privacy law. This demonstrates that EU consumers do care about how their data (6) is being used and passed to third parties and data brokers (7). 1.Does DG Competition agree that personal data is an \u2018essential facility\u2019 (8), in the sense that it is essential for competitors or prospective competitors unable to emerge because a few companies have a monopoly on owning and keeping the data? 2.Can the EU competition authority confirm that structural separation or unbundling is one of the possible tools available to it to restore fair competition under normal market conditions (9)?</p><p> 3.Can the Commission confirm that it can re-open and reassess the Facebook-WhatsApp merger if new details are brought to its attention or it has previously been supplied with misleading or incorrect information? Answer given by Ms Vestager on behalf of the European Commission (2 May 2019) In our competition enforcement, the \u2018essential facility doctrine\u2019 may require a dominant firm to share its assets with others, if an asset is \u2018essential\u2019 (indispensable) for others to compete effectively in the market and if refusing access would eliminate effective competition on that market and thus cause consumer harm. This test requires a detailed case-by-case assessment of whether or not a data set is truly essential. It is therefore not possible to say that, in general, \u2018data\u2019, or \u2018personal data\u2019, is an essential facility. Under the rules set out in Regulation 1/2003, the Commission can order changes to the structure of an undertaking if \u2018there is a substantial risk of a lasting or repeated infringement that derives from the very structure of the undertaking (10)\u2019. This type of structural remedy must be necessary to bring the infringement effectively to an end and it must be proportionate to this objective. This means that, in order to impose such a remedy, the Commission first needs to establish the existence of an infringement, such as an abuse of dominance (11). Second, the Commission must establish that the risk of an abuse is inherent to the structure of the firm and that behavioural remedies would be insufficient or more burdensome. Finally, under the EU Merger Regulation, the Commission can only revoke a decision under strict conditions, namely when the decision is based on incorrect information for which one of the undertakings is responsible or where it has been obtained by deceit. Should such a case arise, the Commission will assess it. \u22c51\u00e2\ufffd\u2122<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/events/european-commission-representation-ireland-events-citizens-dialogue-eu-competition_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/events/european-commission-representation-ireland-events-citizens-dialogue-eu-competition_en</url> \u22c52\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/calendar_en?field_editorial_section_multiple_tid=189\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/calendar_en?field_editorial_section_multiple_tid=189</url> \u22c53\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com\">https://www.facebook.com</url> /EUIreland \u22c54\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com\">https://twitter.com</url> /simonvandorpe/status/1088740632150134784 \u22c55\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.trust.org/item/20190125112939-5m5xw/\">http://news.trust.org/item/20190125112939-5m5xw/</url> \u22c56\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html</url> \u22c57\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000054_EN.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000054_EN.html</url> \u22c58\u00e2\ufffd\u2122      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.concurrences.com\">https://www.concurrences.com</url> /en/glossary-of-competition-terms/Essential-facility \u22c59\u00e2\ufffd\u2122See my previous Written Question in relation to Android Apps,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html</url> \u22c510\u00e2\ufffd\u2122Recital 12 \u22c511\u00e2\ufffd\u2122Dominance in itself is not illegal |( |( |( |( |( |( |( |( |( |( |( |) |) |) |) |) |) |) |) |) |) |) </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN1000968620190503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1H-FRR1-J9XT-P4J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 3, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The tools competition authorities can use to restore fair competitionAt a citizens\u2019 dialogue in Dublin (1), (2), (3), Commissioner Vestager said that the \u2018debate on whether Google search is an essential facility hasn\u2019t concluded yet\u2019, adding: \u2018the most urgent debate is about access to data\u2019 (4).Some big tech platform argue that people don\u2019t really care about privacy as they click all the cookies and pop-ups without reading the details because they want to stay online and continue using the App.However, Europe\u2019s data protection regulators have received more than 95 000 complaints (5) about possible data breaches, eight months after the adoption of a landmark EU privacy law. This demonstrates that EU consumers do care about how their data (6) is being used and passed to third parties and data brokers (7).1.Does DG Competition agree that personal data is an \u2018essential facility\u2019 (8), in the sense that it is essential for competitors or prospective competitors unable to emerge because a few companies have a monopoly on owning and keeping the data?2.Can the EU competition authority confirm that structural separation or unbundling is one of the possible tools available to it to restore fair competition under normal market conditions (9)?3.Can the Commission confirm that it can re-open and reassess the Facebook-WhatsApp merger if new details are brought to its attention or it has previously been supplied with misleading or incorrect information?Answer given by Ms Vestager on behalf of the European Commission(2 May 2019)In our competition enforcement, the \u2018essential facility doctrine\u2019 may require a dominant firm to share its assets with others, if an asset is \u2018essential\u2019 (indispensable) for others to compete effectively in the market and if refusing access would eliminate effective competition on that market and thus cause consumer harm.This test requires a detailed case-by-case assessment of whether or not a data set is truly essential. It is therefore not possible to say that, in general, \u2018data\u2019, or \u2018personal data\u2019, is an essential facility.Under the rules set out in Regulation 1/2003, the Commission can order changes to the structure of an undertaking if \u2018there is a substantial risk of a lasting or repeated infringement that derives from the very structure of the undertaking (10)\u2019. This type of structural remedy must be necessary to bring the infringement effectively to an end and it must be proportionate to this objective.This means that, in order to impose such a remedy, the Commission first needs to establish the existence of an infringement, such as an abuse of dominance (11). Second, the Commission must establish that the risk of an abuse is inherent to the structure of the firm and that behavioural remedies would be insufficient or more burdensome.Finally, under the EU Merger Regulation, the Commission can only revoke a decision under strict conditions, namely when the decision is based on incorrect information for which one of the undertakings is responsible or where it has been obtained by deceit. Should such a case arise, the Commission will assess it.\u22c51\u2219<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/events/european-commission-representation-ireland-events-citizens-dialogue-eu-competition_en\u22c52\u2219https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/calendar_en?field_editorial_section_multiple_tid=189\u22c53\u2219https://www.facebook.com/EUIreland\u22c54\u2219https://twitter.com/simonvandorpe/status/1088740632150134784\u22c55\u2219http://news.trust.org/item/20190125112939-5m5xw/\u22c56\u2219http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\u22c57\u2219http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000054_EN.html\u22c58\u2219https://www.concurrences.com/en/glossary-of-competition-terms/Essential-facility\u22c59\u2219See\">https://ec.europa.eu/ireland/events/european-commission-representation-ireland-events-citizens-dialogue-eu-competition_en\u22c52\u2219https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2014-2019/calendar_en?field_editorial_section_multiple_tid=189\u22c53\u2219https://www.facebook.com/EUIreland\u22c54\u2219https://twitter.com/simonvandorpe/status/1088740632150134784\u22c55\u2219http://news.trust.org/item/20190125112939-5m5xw/\u22c56\u2219http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\u22c57\u2219http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000054_EN.html\u22c58\u2219https://www.concurrences.com/en/glossary-of-competition-terms/Essential-facility\u22c59\u2219See</url> my previous Written Question in relation to Android Apps,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\u22c510\u2219Recital\">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-8-2019-000001_EN.html\u22c510\u2219Recital</url> 12\u22c511\u2219Dominance in itself is not illegal((((((((((() ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )) )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1901638I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W23-X631-JDG9-Y46N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 3, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As they hunt for new growth engines, Google, Amazon and Apple are convinced they can make money by cutting costs in the sector. With vast financial resources, the stock market value of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet is now above USD 1 trillion for the first time. (2) .The purpose of Google\u2019s recent USD 2.1 billion offer for Fitbit (3) , the activity-tracking wearable technology company, is to acquire \u2018one of the most exquisite data sources\u2019 (4) .1 Can the Commission provide a figure on the value of the healthcare industry in Europe?2 What is its position regarding the accumulation by big tech companies of electronic health records combined with data from smartphones, watches, home assistants and Apps that record all of a citizen\u2019s sensitive information?3 In acquiring Fitbit, does the advantage gained by Google to combine, learn from and use vast data sources not limit competition?Answer given by Ms Kyriakides on behalf of the European Commission(26 May 2020)In 2016, it was estimated (5) that the combined share of expenditures on medicinal products and medical devices in 2012 comprised some 25% of total expenditures on healthcare in the EU. According to Eurostat, the total value of healthcare expenditure in the EU28 was about EUR 1 481 billion in 2016 (6), which equals to about 10% of gross domestic product in the EU for the same year.For the EU, the protection of personal data is of paramount importance and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (7) requires companies processing personal data to respect data protection principles, such as data minimisation, integrity and confidentiality, and to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to integrate these principles into the processing.The ePrivacy Directive (8) allows storing of or access to information in a user\u2019s terminal equipment only with the informed consent of that user or if strictly necessary for the transmission of a communication or the provision of an information society service explicitly requested by that user. The monitoring and enforcement of the application of privacy and data protection rules falls primarily under the competence of data protection authorities and courts.The Google/Fitbit transaction has not been formally notified to the Commission. It is always up to the companies to notify transactions with an EU dimension to the Commission. Should the transaction be subject to the Commission\u2019s merger control review, it will be carefully assessed under the applicable rules set out in the EU Merger Regulation (9).\u22c51\u2219<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790.\u22c52\u2219https://www.ft.com/content/4ade8884-1b40-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\u22c53\u2219https://www.ft.com/content/f6a710b4-fca5-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6.\u22c54\u2219https://www.ft.com/content/f6a710b4-fca5-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6.\u22c55\u2219https://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/docs/2016_sante_144_health_technology_assessments_en.pdf\u22c56\u2219https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do\u22c57\u2219https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN\u22c58\u2219Directive\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790.\u22c52\u2219https://www.ft.com/content/4ade8884-1b40-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\u22c53\u2219https://www.ft.com/content/f6a710b4-fca5-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6.\u22c54\u2219https://www.ft.com/content/f6a710b4-fca5-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6.\u22c55\u2219https://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/roadmaps/docs/2016_sante_144_health_technology_assessments_en.pdf\u22c56\u2219https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do\u22c57\u2219https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN\u22c58\u2219Directive</url> 2002/58/EC:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058&amp;from=EN\u22c59\u2219https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32004R0139&amp;from=en(((((((((\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058&amp;from=EN\u22c59\u2219https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32004R0139&amp;from=en(((((((((</url>) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3350139</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-2S61-JDG9-Y09T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"702\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 29, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The UN, Interpol and Europol have reported that there is a<br/> convergence between organised crime and terrorism and the use of the financial system for<br/> criminal purposes. I support this initiative. Activities related to money laundering make large use<br/> of cash transactions and the spread and use of on-line bank accounts has increased. This initiative,<br/> among other things, says that the Commission should assess the size of a maximum threshold of<br/> cash transfers to be adopted at EU level, leaving to Member States the choice to impose lower<br/> thresholds, and the assessment should be carried out within two years from the date of entry into<br/> force of the Directive.

It is<br/> important to acknowledge that the cost of a full vaccines package for one child, even at the<br/> lowest global prices, increased by a factor of 68 between 2001 and 2014, and this price increase is<br/> unjustifiable and incompatible with the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring healthy lives<br/> and promoting wellbeing at all ages, Within the EU and the EEA, countries vary considerably in<br/> relation to recommended vaccines. EU Member States have all endorsed the WHO\u2019s European<br/> Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020. The decline in vaccination acceptance in Europe has led to<br/> noteworthy measles outbursts and related deaths in some European countries, something that<br/> we have to prevent as much as possible.<br/> 4-342-5000<br/> Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. 226;128;146; Sendo verdade qua a vacina231;227;o dificilmente chega a<br/> 100% da popula231;227;o, 233; tamb233;m um facto ineg225;vel que quanto maior for o n250;mero de vacinados,<br/> maior a prote231;227;o conferida, inclusive aos n227;o vacinados, o que se define por imunidade de grupo.<br/> Onde foi parar a difteria?

Primjena najni\u017ee standardne stope PDV-a od 15 % produljena je \u0161est puta otkako je Vije\u0107e 1992. godine postiglo dogovor o pravilima kojima se ograni\u010dava sloboda dr\u017eava \u010dlanica u utvr\u0111ivanju stopa PDV-a te se dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama propisuje primjena te najni\u017ee standardne stope tijekom odre\u0111enog razdoblja. To samo po sebi nije imalo prakti\u010dnih posljedica, s obzirom na to da su sve dr\u017eave \u010dlanice primjenjivale standardne stope PDV-a znatno vi\u0161e od 15 % (trenuta\u010dno sve dr\u017eave \u010dlanice primjenjuju standardnu stopu od barem 17 %). Podr\u017eavam ovaj prijedlog jer smatram da je izuzetno va\u017eno da sve \u010dlanice imaju istu najni\u017eu stopu PDV-a te da je dobro odrediti i najvi\u0161u dozvoljenu granicu PDV-a, kako ne bismo imali velike razlike izme\u0111u poreznih sustava dr\u017eava \u010dlanica, a \u0161to najvi\u0161e osje\u0107aju sami gra\u0111ani. 4-273-9218 Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 (ECR), napisan. \u2012 Tr\u017eite ekolo\u0161kih proizvoda utrostru\u010dilo se u periodu izme\u0111u 2005. i 2015. godine, uz trend daljnjeg rasta. Budu\u0107i da je trenutno va\u017ee\u0107a Uredba bila zastarjela te nedostatna rastu koji je ekolo\u0161ka proizvodnja do\u017eivljavala, Komisija je predlo\u017eila reformu Uredbe o ekolo\u0161koj proizvodnji jo\u0161 2014. Promjene koje su predlo\u017eene ne smatram demokrati\u010dnima niti pozitivnima te izvje\u0161\u0107e nije moglo dobiti moju podr\u0161ku. 4-273-9296 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 This proposal, which I support, sets an agreed limit of VAT rate that ensures the proper functioning of the internal market, and at the same time is flexible enough as for Member States to set a standard VAT rate instead of different lastminute prolongations of a temporary minimum rate. Moreover, this proposal lays within a series of several legislative proposals whose objective is to reform the EU VAT system, moving towards a definitive EU VAT system, reforms which are necessary and Member States should agree upon their implementation in a smooth manner. It is also time for this Parliament to hold taxationrelated legislative powers. 4-273-9335 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 A Comiss\u00e3o prop\u00f5e tornar uma disposi\u00e7\u00e3o tempor\u00e1ria existente definitiva (artigo 97.\u00ba da Diretiva IVA). A proposta visa evitar que o m\u00ednimo de 15% para a taxa normal do IVA expire em 1 de janeiro de 2018 e assegure que todos os Estados-Membros apliquem uma taxa normal de um m\u00ednimo de 15% de forma permanente. Considerando que todos os Estados-Membros aplicam atualmente uma taxa normal de, pelo menos, 17%, o atual regime de uma taxa normal m\u00ednima de 15% continua a ser adequado, tendo em conta a OCM. A comiss\u00e3o ECON aprova a proposta da Comiss\u00e3o. Trata-se, por isso, de um processo simplificado, de acordo com o artigo 50.\u00ba, n.\u00ba 1, do Regimento, para o qual n\u00e3o houve obje\u00e7\u00f5es. 4-273-9375 Iuliu Winkler (PPE), \u00een scris. \u2012 Am votat raportul PE referitor la propunerea de directiv\u0103 a Consiliului cu privire la sistemul comun al taxei pe valoarea ad\u0103ugat\u0103, \u00een ceea ce prive\u0219te obliga\u021bia de respectare a cotei standard minime.

S obzirom na sve ve\u0107u povezanost organiziranog kriminala i terorizma, borba protiv mre\u017ea organiziranog kriminala trebala bi biti sastavni dio svih strategija za borbu protiv financiranja terorizma. Ovim se dokumentom ujedno \u017eeli \u0161tititi integritet i funkcioniranje financijskog sustava te sprije\u010diti nelegalne financijske aktivnosti. EU treba u okviru suradnje s tre\u0107im zemljama pomo\u0107i u\u010dvr\u0161\u0107ivanju financijskih sustava tih zemalja radi suzbijanja financijskog kriminala i nezakonitih aktivnosti na globalnom nivou. 4-287-6250 Marijana Petir (PPE), napisan. \u2012 Svrha ovog izvje\u0161\u0107a pove\u0107anje je transparentnost kako bi se borili protiv financiranja terorizma, utaje poreza i pranja novca. Komisija je 2. velja\u010de 2016. predstavila akcijski plan za ja\u010danje borbe protiv financiranja terorizma koji nagla\u0161ava potrebu prilagodbe novim prijetnjama i pobolj\u0161anje sada\u0161njeg okvira u tom smislu. Neovisno Vije\u0107e ECOFIN-a tako\u0111er je 22. travnja 2016. pozvalo na djelovanje, i to posebno u smislu pove\u0107anja dostupnosti blagajni\u010dkih registara vlasni\u0161tva, razja\u0161njavanja zahtjeva za registraciju trgova\u010dkih dru\u0161tava, ubrzanja me\u0111usobnog povezivanja nacionalnih registara vlasni\u0161tva, promicanja automatske razmjene informacija. Ovaj Prijedlog rezolucije obuhva\u0107a sve te prijedloge i preporuke te mu je cilj oja\u010dati pravni okvir Unije za suzbijanje pranja novca i financiranja terorizma budu\u0107i da on donosi niz mjera za bolju borbu protiv financiranja terorizma i osiguranje ve\u0107e transparentnosti financijskih transakcija te poslovnih subjekata u okviru preventivnog pravnog okvira koji je na snazi u Uniji. Terorizam je realna prijetnja koja \u0107e nestati jedino ako se zaustavi dotok novca za njegovo financiranje. 4-287-7500 Alfred Sant (S&amp;D), in writing. \u2012 Ensuring the safe management of EU funds by making them resilient to money laundering and terrorism financing is a prerequisite to any EU action. I especially welcome the inclusion of greater information on beneficial ownership and the concentration of information in a public central register of beneficial ownership. Cooperation between the Member States\u2019 authorities is key in this revision, regardless of their status or nature. Proper enforcement of this greater cooperation and exchange of information mechanism will then need to be ensured at the national level. There has been a tendency over the past year to legislate on the protection of the Union\u2019s financial interests and to extend the scope of application, which was necessary. I am nevertheless concerned that this revision would disproportionally impact the Member States\u2019 tax flexibility as it would notably apply to tax advisors and electronic money distributors. While I welcome deeper transparency standards, I am concerned about the growing space the EU is taking in controlling and operating national tax systems across the EU, which in my view must remain the responsibility of the individual Member States. 4-287-8750 Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 (ECR), napisan. \u2012 Stalna prijetnja koju terorizam predstavlja za dr\u017eave \u010dlanice Europske unije jasan je znak da su Direktivi o spre\u010davanju kori\u0161tenja financijskog sustava u svrhu pranja novca ili financiranja terorizma i Direktivi 2009/101/EZ potrebne izmjene i nadopune. Naime, ove izmjene su odgovor na teroristi\u010dke napade u Parizu i na problem pranja novca na koji je ukazala afera \u201ePanama Papers\u201c. Smatram da predlo\u017eene promjene predstavljaju pozitivne korake ka rje\u0161avanju pitanja utaje poreza i pranja novca te kori\u0161tenja novca u svrhu financiranja terorizma. Stalno a\u017euriranje zakonodavstva na ovim podru\u010djima potrebno je zbog olak\u0161avanja istraga i procesuiranja nezakonitih aktivnosti vezanih uz kori\u0161tenje novca za teroristi\u010dke aktivnosti, korupciju i ilegalnu trgovinu. Naime, oni koji se bave takvim aktivnostima usavr\u0161avaju svoje tehnike za provo\u0111enje nezakonitih radnji, stoga zakoni trebaju pratiti njihov razvoj kako bi borba protiv prijetnji bila pravovremena i u\u010dinkovita. Zbog toga sam podr\u017eala ovo izvje\u0161\u0107e. 4-287-9375 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 One of the most preoccupying issues within the whole terrorism matter is the fact that the financial system can be used for money laundering purposes or terrorist financing. The UN, Interpol and Europol have reported that there is a convergence between organised crime and terrorism and the use of the financial system for criminal purposes. I support this initiative. Activities related to money laundering make large use of cash transactions and the spread and use of on-line bank accounts has increased. This initiative, among other things, says that the Commission should assess the size of a maximum threshold of cash transfers to be adopted at EU level, leaving to Member States the choice to impose lower thresholds, and the assessment should be carried out within two years from the date of entry into force of the Directive. Measures released by the EU need to reflect the commitments undertaken by the EU at international level and have due regard for the fundamental rights and principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. 4-287-9531 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 Com esta discuss\u00e3o, estamos mais uma vez confrontados com os compromissos dos grandes partidos com os centros de decis\u00e3o do poder econ\u00f3mico das multinacionais e da finan\u00e7a. Apesar dos esc\u00e2ndalos fiscais que revelam ao mundo todo o ecossistema que promove a opacidade e o anonimato, a Uni\u00e3o Europeia continua condicionada e cada proposta enfrenta resist\u00eancia que trava medidas elementares e mitiga o seu alcance.

Os benefici\u00e1rios efetivos das funda\u00e7\u00f5es continuar\u00e3o inc\u00f3gnitos e mesmo a sua identifica\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica no quadro do registo das empresas fica condicionada a uma quota de participa\u00e7\u00e3o de 25%, permitindo assim furtar-se ao cumprimento da diretiva. S\u00e3o apenas dois exemplos que demonstram que a voz das multinacionais continua a falar mais alto neste Parlamento. \u00c9 por isso que cada pe\u00e7a legislativa fica sempre muito aqu\u00e9m do necess\u00e1rio. 4-287-9687 Iuliu Winkler (PPE), \u00een scris. \u2012 Am votat raportul PE cu privire la propunerea de directiv\u0103 european\u0103 referitoare la prevenirea utiliz\u0103rii sistemului financiar \u00een scopul sp\u0103l\u0103rii banilor \u0219i finan\u021b\u0103rii terorismului.

Klju\u010dne promjene koje su predlo\u017eene su ja\u010danje nadzora tr\u017ei\u0161ta odnosno kontrole vozila nakon njihovog stavljanja na tr\u017ei\u0161te, definiranje uloge i odgovornosti provedbenih tijela, poja\u0161njenja u vezi s financiranjem aktivnosti povezanih s nadzorom tr\u017ei\u0161ta te \u0107e homologacije svakih pet godina revidirati homologacijsko tijelo razli\u010dito od onog koje ih je izdalo. Posljednjih godina pokazalo se da je zakonodavstvo vezano uz homologaciju i nadzor tr\u017ei\u0161ta motornih vozila i njihovih prikolica te sustava, sastavnih dijelova i zasebnih tehni\u010dkih jedinica namijenjenih za takva vozila zastarjelo, a dr\u017eave \u010dlanice razli\u010dito tuma\u010de zahtjeve i ne primjenjuju ih jednako strogo. Jasno je da se mora pobolj\u0161ati sustav za homologaciju te uspostaviti primjereni nadzorni mehanizam za jam\u010denje uskla\u0111enosti postupaka u dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama. Zbog toga sam podr\u017eala ovo izvje\u0161\u0107e. 4-291-9375 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 There is a need to introduce market surveillance provisions to complement the type-approval requirements as regards to motor vehicles and their trailers, as well as a need to clarify their safeguard procedures and the conditions for granting extensions to approvals for existing types of vehicle. I therefore support this initiative, as it also includes the necessity to align roles and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain, and of the authorities and parties involved in the enforcement of the framework, among other issues. 1.4 Organic production and labelling of organic products (A8-0311/2015 - Martin H\u00e4usling) 4-301-0625 Jonathan Arnott (EFDD), in writing. \u2012 The report claims to simplify and rationalise EU intervention in organic farming but it also aims to enshrine it in perpetuity by proposing an EU Organic Agency.

XXX/XXX Europskog parlamenta i Vije\u0107a [Uredba o slu\u017ebenim kontrolama] i stavljanju izvan snage Uredbe Vije\u0107a (EZ) br. 834/2007 jer mislim da upravo bio proizvodnja i zemljopisno podrijetlo proizvoda trebaju u budu\u0107nosti biti jedan od stupova Zajedni\u010dke poljoprivredne politike EU-a. Treba istaknuti tri principa bio proizvodnje i ozna\u010davanja bio proizvoda: harmonizacija, standardizacija i pojednostavljenje postupaka. Takav pristup ide u korist proizvo\u0111a\u010da i potro\u0161a\u010da. Nova Uredba stupa na snagu 1. sije\u010dnja 2021., a jedan od glavnih ciljeva iste uvo\u0111enje je jednog skupa propisa na razini EU-a kojim je obuhva\u0107en cijeli ekolo\u0161ki sektor u EU-u. Tako\u0111er, unaprije\u0111en je sustav kontrola na poljoprivrednim gospodarstvima u vidu sprje\u010davanja prijevara i nepravilnosti, dok \u0107e vi\u0161u kvalitetu proizvoda osigurati mjere predostro\u017enosti. Ekolo\u0161ki proizvo\u0111a\u010di mo\u0107i \u0107e odstupiti od na\u010dela redovnih godi\u0161njih kontrola ukoliko se ustanovi uskla\u0111enost s pravilima ove uredbe te doka\u017ee da neprekidno, u periodu od tri godine, nije do\u0161lo do nepravilnosti. U tim slu\u010dajevima nacionalna tijela mogu odlu\u010diti da se kontrole na poljoprivrednim gospodarstvima vr\u0161e svake dvije godine. Tako\u0111er, uvodi se mogu\u0107nost uspostavljanja ili zadr\u017eavanja nacionalnih pragova za neodobrene tvari. 4-301-2500 Miroslav Mikol\u00e1\u0161ik (PPE), p\u00edsomne. \u2012 Ekologick\u00fd potravinov\u00fd re\u0165azec rastie v neprecedentnej miere a \u010del\u00ed viacer\u00fdm v\u00fdzvam.

It introduces amendments offering more precision on products and processes lying within the proposed regulation, such as definitions and clarifications and positive lists for authorised substances foreseen in the annexes, as well as principles concerning management of biological processes. There are going to be exceptions from some rules, exceptions which are going to be phased out over time, although based on reliable data on availability of regions and Member States. This initiative also looks for the need to simplify legislation.

Trenuta\u010dnim skupom \u201eintegriranih smjernica\u201d nastoji se poduprijeti strategija Europa 2020. u kontekstu pristupa dono\u0161enju ekonomskih politika koje se temelje na ulaganju, strukturnim reformama i fiskalnoj odgovornosti. Unutar tog okvira, integriranim se smjernicama istodobno treba poduprijeti postizanje pametnog, odr\u017eivog i uklju\u010divog rasta te ciljevi Europskog semestra za uskla\u0111ivanje gospodarskih politika. Podr\u017eavam ovaj Prijedlog jer su u njemu revidirane smjernice za politike zapo\u0161ljavanja dr\u017eava \u010dlanica te su izmijenjene kako bi se tekst uskladio s na\u010delima europskog stupa socijalnih prava, a \u0161to mo\u017ee doprinijeti smanjenju nezaposlenosti koja je u pojedinim dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama iznimno visoka. 4-300-7636 Tibor Szanyi (S&amp;D), in writing. \u2012 With my vote, I cast support for the report, in order to align the text with the principles of the European pillar of social rights, which constitutes a reference framework to monitor the employment and social performance. I am convinced that this is an important step to fulfil the European Social Pillar. This proposal is pertinent to set out common priorities and objectives for national employment policies and to provide the Member States with specific recommendations. In short, to strengthen Europe\u2019s social model. There are many challenges that derive from the financial and economic crisis and that affect the social sphere. In line with these challenges, we have to take an active role. I agree with the proposal of the Commission on the idea that the Union has to combat social exclusion and discrimination and to promote social justice and protection, as well as equality between women and men. Therefore, I trust that by implementing these guidelines for the employment policies, not only at a national level, but at a regional and local level as well, we can take a step forward and guarantee a fairer social life in terms of employment, equality and inclusion. 4-300-7656 Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 (ECR), napisan. \u2012 Ovo nezakonodavno izvje\u0161\u0107e odbora EMPL prete\u010da je odluke Vije\u0107a o smjernicama zapo\u0161ljavanja. Smjernice nemaju pravnu snagu, ve\u0107 kreiraju smjer i opseg za koordiniranje politika individualnih dr\u017eava \u010dlanica vezano uz zapo\u0161ljavanje. One tako\u0111er \u010dine bazu specifi\u010dnih preporuka po pojedina\u010dnim dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama unutar relevantnih podru\u010dja politika Europskog semestra. Za razliku od prethodnih godina, ciljevi i prioriteti za 2018. promijenjeni su i nadopunjavani kako bi bili u mogu\u0107nosti prilagoditi se s principima Europskog stupa socijalnih prava, usvojenih u prosincu 2017., \u0161to je dovelo do zna\u010dajnog pro\u0161irivanja teksta. Isto se dogodilo i s izvje\u0161\u0107em odbora EMPL, koje je tako\u0111er pro\u0161ireno kako bi bilo u mogu\u0107nosti obuhvatiti rezoluciju Parlamenta o Europskom stupu socijalnih prava. Na\u017ealost, kroz navedeni proces u izvje\u0161\u0107e su inkorporirani i dijelovi koji zna\u010dajno prelaze kompetencije EU-a te kr\u0161e princip supsidijarnosti. Iz tog razloga glasovala sam suzdr\u017eano. 4-300-7812 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 I support this initiative as I also deem relevant the necessity to establish guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States. The EU has developed and implemented policy coordination instruments for fiscal, macroeconomic and structural policies which have a significant impact on the social and employment situation. Some of these instruments, the present Guidelines for the Employment Policies of the Member States, form the Integrated Guidelines for Implementing the Europe 2020 Strategy, whose aim is to guide policy implementation in the Member States and in the EU. 4-300-8125 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 S\u00e3o apresentadas algumas considera\u00e7\u00f5es positivas, como a necessidade de criar empregos, que estes empregos tenham qualidade, cheios de bons objetivos e boas formula\u00e7\u00f5es. No entanto, essa \u201cbondade\u201d \u00e9 depois contrariada, com a afirma\u00e7\u00e3o do caminho, das orienta\u00e7\u00f5es que devem ser cumpridas, nomeadamente continuar a colocar a \u00eanfase nas reformas estruturais e na promo\u00e7\u00e3o da competitividade, no al\u00edvio da burocracia e dos encargos das PME, na redu\u00e7\u00e3o da carga fiscal sobre o trabalho (leia-se, do que pagam as empresas), na promo\u00e7\u00e3o da sustentabilidade dos sistemas de pens\u00f5es e na promo\u00e7\u00e3o do envelhecimento ativo (leia-se, atrasar a aposentadoria, ligando esse momento \u00e0 esperan\u00e7a m\u00e9dia de vida). Da Comiss\u00e3o e do Parlamento, nada de novo \u2013 a mesma estrat\u00e9gia de desprote\u00e7\u00e3o dos trabalhadores e das popula\u00e7\u00f5es mais fr\u00e1geis. Bem que a UE pode acenar com objetivos sociais, mas o seu objetivo est\u00e1 patente em documentos como estes. Isso ficou claro recentemente em Portugal, cujos resultados macroecon\u00f3micos at\u00e9 t\u00eam sido positivos, quando a Comiss\u00e3o sublinhou que s\u00f3 uma pol\u00edtica de despedimentos mais f\u00e1ceis poderia dinamizar o mercado de trabalho. 1.6 Estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2019 \u2013 Section I \u2013 European Parliament (A8-0146/2018 - Paul R\u00fcbig) 4-300-9453 Jonathan Arnott (EFDD), in writing. \u2012 As the UK will still be in the EU at the start of 2019, I felt it was justifiable for me to vote on this report. This report contains the estimates of revenue and expenditure for the financial year of 2019. It states that there will be an increase of 3.9% from the 2018 budget (including EUR 37.3 million for the change of the parliament term and EUR 34.3 million for other extraordinary expenditure). I voted against the resolution because I cannot support an increased EU budget for 2019, especially considering that the British people have already voted to leave and expect to stop paying money to the EU altogether. 4-300-9492 Carlos Coelho (PPE), por escrito. \u2012 O Or\u00e7amento de 2019 \u00e9 o quarto processo or\u00e7amental realizado integralmente na nova legislatura e o sexto durante o quadro financeiro plurianual de 2014-2020.

Potrebno je uzeti u obzir da \u0107e zbog izbora za Europski parlament 2019. rashodi znatno porasti u odre\u0111enim podru\u010djima, dok \u0107e se zbog manjeg opsega rada u drugim podru\u010djima ostvariti u\u0161tede. U\u0161tede su potrebne, ali prioritet mora ostati djelotvorno kori\u0161tenje prora\u010duna, bez dovo\u0111enja u pitanje klju\u010dne nadle\u017enosti i djelovanja Europskog parlamenta. Va\u017eno je, kao i prethodnih godina, izdvojiti iznos za ulaganja i rashode koji se smatraju \u201eizvanrednima\u201d.

Glavni tajnik predlo\u017eio je prora\u010dun u iznosu od 2 016 644 000 eura za 2019. godinu, a taj kona\u010dni prijedlog ni\u017ei je od prvotnog zbog u\u0161tede koja se o\u010dekuje odlaskom britanskih zastupnika i njihovih asistenata 30. o\u017eujka 2019. godine. Unato\u010d planiranoj u\u0161tedi, predlo\u017eeni iznos zna\u010di porast od 2,38% u odnosu na prora\u010dun za 2018. godinu. To se opravdava, izme\u0111u ostalog, predizbornom kampanjom za izbore za Europski parlament 2019., pobolj\u0161anjem usluga za zastupnike i poticanjem ekolo\u0161kog pristupa prijevozu.

The 2019 budget\u2019s objectives are the 2019 European Parliament election campaign, security projects, multiannual building projects, IT development, improving services for Members and encouraging a green approach to transport. Almost two thirds of the budget is index-bound expenditure which relates mainly to remunerations, pensions, medical expenses and allowances for serving and retired MEPs (23%) and staff (34%), as well as to buildings (13%), adjusted according to the Staff Regulations and Statute for Members, to sector-specific indexation, or to the inflation rate. The EP\u2019s credibility as one arm of the budgetary authority depends to an extent on its ability to manage its own spending, and on its ability to develop democracy. 4-300-9677 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 O relat\u00f3rio sublinha o seu apoio a uma maior transpar\u00eancia em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao subs\u00eddio para despesas gerais para os deputados e insta a Mesa do Parlamento a trabalhar com mais afinco no que respeita \u00e0 responsabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o pelas despesas autorizadas ao abrigo deste subs\u00eddio, sem gerar custos adicionais ou encargos administrativos para a administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Parlamento ou para os deputados e os seus gabinetes.

Data users, like private actors and policymakers, use statistics to take evidence-based decisions and compare options. European business statistics will have to be built on a common framework with harmonised definitions that facilitate the understanding of the state of the European economy. Furthermore, data should be gathered in a cost-effective manner and provided in a timely way, with comparability across Member States. 1.8 Common rules for the internal market in natural gas (A8-0143/2018 - Jerzy Buzek) 4-300-9980 Jonathan Arnott (EFDD), in writing. \u2012 I do not support harmonisation of this matter at European Union level. 4-300-9990 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 Energy Union Strategy, adopted by the European Commission on 25 February 2015, has a complementary action in this initiative, which I support. A consistent and stable legal framework is a precondition for achieving these objectives. By providing total legal clarity and transparency of existing legislation, the Commission\u2019s proposal amending the current Gas Directive ensures a level playing field for all EU energy market participants as well as long-term investment certainty and predictability, which are key elements for every reliable investor or operator wanting to play according to fair and equal rules. 1.9 Protection of investigative journalists in Europe: the case of Slovak journalist J\u00e1n Kuciak and Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1 (B8-0186/2018) 4-315-1250 Jonathan Arnott (EFDD), in writing. \u2012 I am deeply concerned about these cases, and highly supportive of freedom of expression and freedom of speech. I am not convinced that this report proposes the correct remedial action, and therefore I abstained overall after supporting some amendments to the resolution. 4-315-1875 \u039b\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 (NI), \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03c2. \u2013 \u0397 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03cc\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf \u03b7 \u03c8\u03ae\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b8\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 B8-0186/2018. 4-315-2500 Marijana Petir (PPE), napisan. \u2012 U velja\u010di 2018. godine u svojoj obiteljskoj ku\u0107i ubijen je slova\u010dki novinar Jan Kuciak i njegova partnerica Martina Ku\u0161nirova. Mladi novinar posebno je pratio korupcijske afere, me\u0111u kojima je i ona o mogu\u0107oj povezanosti poslovne zajednice sa strankom na vlasti. Navodno se spremao objaviti \u010dlanak o povezanosti slova\u010dkih vlasti s talijanskom mafijom, a isti je naposljetku posthumno i objavljen. Na slobodi novinarstva po\u010diva zdrava demokracija, stoga i podr\u017eavam ovu rezoluciju, cilj koje je za\u0161tita istra\u017eiva\u010dkih novinara, ali i novinara op\u0107enito. Moramo potaknuti Komisiju i dr\u017eave \u010dlanice da donesu zakonodavne i nezakonodavne prijedloge za za\u0161titu novinara u EU-u koji se redovito suo\u010davaju s prijetnjama kojima se nastoji cenzurirati njihov rad ili kojima ih se nastoji zastra\u0161iti. Tako\u0111er, preraspodjelom postoje\u0107ih resursa u korist neovisnog istra\u017eiva\u010dkog novinarstva trebali bismo stvoriti trajni program financijske potpore, uklju\u010duju\u0107i i poseban prora\u010dun, dok Vije\u0107e mora sura\u0111ivati s dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama u \u0161to br\u017eoj uspostavi Ureda europskog javnog tu\u017eitelja.

Il s\u2019agit du cinqui\u00e8me cas d'assassinat d'un journaliste dans un \u00c9tat membre de l'Union au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Une presse libre, pluraliste et ind\u00e9pendante constitue un des piliers de la d\u00e9mocratie, mais il faut, pour cela, prot\u00e9ger les journalistes d\u2019investigation qui sont de plus en plus menac\u00e9s. Cette protection varie grandement d\u2019un \u00c9tat \u00e0 l\u2019autre et, dans la plupart des cas, ne m\u00e9nage pas de garanties r\u00e9elles contre les repr\u00e9sailles ou les menaces. C\u2019est pourquoi j\u2019ai apport\u00e9 mon soutien plein et entier \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution du Parlement europ\u00e9en qui appelle la Commission et les \u00c9tats membres \u00e0 agir et \u00e0 prendre leurs responsabilit\u00e9s politiques. Dans cette r\u00e9solution, nous appelons la Commission \u00e0 proposer une l\u00e9gislation horizontale et compl\u00e8te ainsi qu\u2019un dispositif de soutien financier au journalisme d\u2019investigation ind\u00e9pendant. 4-315-5000 Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 (ECR), napisan. \u2012 Ubojstvo slova\u010dkog istra\u017eiva\u010dkog novinara Jana Kuciaka te njegove zaru\u010dnice Martine Ku\u0161nirove, koji su prona\u0111eni mrtvi 25. velja\u010de, pokrenulo je mnoga pitanja vezano uz za\u0161titu novinara koji se bave istra\u017enim novinarstvom. Jan Kuciak radio je na istra\u017eivanju vezanom uz prevare u PDV-u te prevare povezane s Europskim fondom za ruralni razvoj, a netom prije smaknu\u0107a radio je na temi povezanosti talijanske mafije Ndrangheta sa slova\u010dkom politikom. Italija je objavila kako je mafija Ndrangheta u Slova\u010dkoj prisutna jo\u0161 od 2013., ali po tom pitanju je nakon te objave u\u010dinjeno jako malo. Istra\u017eiva\u010dki rad Jana Kuciaka tako\u0111er je otkrivao opravdane sumnje u korupciju visokih du\u017enosnika slova\u010dke politike koja nije prikladno adresirana od strane tijela za provedbu prava u toj dr\u017eavi. Policija je potvrdila kako vjeruju da je Kuciak bio ubijen upravo zbog posla koji je obavljao. Posjet delegacije Europskog parlamenta otkrio je kako su povjerenje u policiju i pravosudna tijela u toj dr\u017eavi na iznimno niskim granama. Ovo ubojstvo dovelo je do najmasovnijih mirnih demonstracija jo\u0161 od bar\u0161unaste revolucije 1989. nakon kojih su premijer i ministar unutarnjih poslova odstupili s du\u017enosti. Nastavno na navedeno, potpunosti podupirem sadr\u017eaj i ciljeve ove rezolucije te sam stoga glasovala za. 4-315-7500 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 I support this initiative as I also believe journalists have the right to investigate. Free and independent media constitute one of the cornerstones of a democratic society and Member States have the obligation to ensure that press freedom and journalists are protected on their territory. The rights to freedom of expression and freedom of opinion are indispensable conditions for the full realisation of the principles of transparency and accountability. This motion focuses on Slovak investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his partner Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, who were found murdered in their home in Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Ma\u010da on 25 February 2018. Their death, together with Malta\u2019s journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, are black spots in the EU\u2019s achievements as regards to freedom of the press. 1.10 A European values instrument to support civil society organisations which promote democracy, rule of law and fundamental values within the European Union (B8-0189/2018) 4-327-1250 Jonathan Arnott (EFDD), in writing. \u2012 I oppose the use of taxpayers\u2019 money for another propaganda scheme used to promote the EU. 4-327-1562 \u039b\u03ac\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 (NI), \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03c2. \u2013 \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c8\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ad\u03ba\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf \u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03af \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd. \u039f \u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c1\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039c\u039a\u039f \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u00ab\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u00bb \u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c7\u03cd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03b3\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd, \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c1\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c9\u03b8\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd. \u039f\u03b9 \u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03be\u03c5\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03c3\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03be\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2, \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b7\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03b4\u03cc\u03ba\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b2\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03b5\u03c2. 4-327-1875 Ivan Jakov\u010di\u0107 (ALDE), napisan. \u2012 Glasao sam za prijedlog rezolucije podnesen nakon izjave Komisije u skladu s \u010dlankom 123. stavkom 2. Poslovnika o potrebi za uspostavom instrumenta europskih vrijednosti za podr\u0161ku organizacijama civilnog dru\u0161tva koje promi\u010du temeljne vrijednosti u Europskoj uniji na lokalnoj i nacionalnoj razini (2018/2619(RSP)), kojim se poziva EU da u okviru svojeg prora\u010duna za sljede\u0107i Vi\u0161egodi\u0161nji financijski okvir (VFO) za razdoblje nakon 2020. uspostavi instrument za namjensko financiranje radi promicanja i za\u0161tite vrijednosti iz \u010dlanka 2. UEU-a, osobito demokracije, vladavine prava i temeljnih prava. Razina financiranja trebala bi odgovarati razini Europskog instrumenta za demokraciju i ljudska prava koji ima sli\u010dnu svrhu izvan granica Unije. Ovim instrumentom promicale bi se europske vrijednosti unutar granica Unije na lokalnoj i nacionalnoj razini. Poseban naglasak trebalo bi staviti na izgradnju kapaciteta organizacija civilnog dru\u0161tva radi poticanja sudjelovanja javnosti kako bi se pobolj\u0161alo njezino poimanje pluralisti\u010dke i participativne demokracije, vladavine prava i temeljnih prava. 4-327-2500 Marijana Petir (PPE), napisan. \u2012 Podr\u017eala sam prijedlog rezolucije o potrebi uspostave Europskog instrumenta vrijednosti koji podupire organizacije civilnog dru\u0161tva koje promi\u010du temeljne vrijednosti unutar Europske unije na lokalnoj i nacionalnoj razini. Potrebno je uspostaviti poseban instrument financiranja \u2013 koji bi se mogao nazvati Europskim instrumentom vrijednosti \u2013 za promicanje i za\u0161titu vrijednosti sadr\u017eanih u \u010dlanku 2. EUU-a, posebice demokracije, vladavine prava i temeljnih prava, a unutar prora\u010duna EU-a u sljede\u0107em vi\u0161egodi\u0161njem financijskom okviru (MFF) nakon 2020. godine. Instrument bi trebao specifi\u010dno usmjeravati projekte i inicijative koje promi\u010du europske vrijednosti na lokalnoj i nacionalnoj razini, kao \u0161to su projekti sudjelovanja gra\u0111ana i zagovaranja te druge aktivnosti, a transnacionalni projekti i inicijative trebaju imati samo ulogu supsidijarnosti. Moramo, me\u0111utim, otkloniti svaku mogu\u0107nost zloupotrebe tog Instrumenta, a skre\u0107em pozornost i na potpuno transparentno kori\u0161tenja sredstava, zdravo financijsko upravljanje i pa\u017eljivo kori\u0161tenje resursa. 4-327-3125 Christine Revault d'Allonnes Bonnefoy (S&amp;D), par \u00e9crit. \u2012 J\u2019ai vot\u00e9 en faveur d\u2019une r\u00e9solution sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir un instrument europ\u00e9en des valeurs pour soutenir les organisations de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile qui promeuvent nos valeurs fondamentales au sein de l'Union.

The main lesson we should take from Europe s experience with democracy is that democracy is something we must take care of and protect every day. A vibrant and vigilant civil society is democracy s safety net. Every now and then in this Parliament we raise concerns about democracy and fundamental rights elsewhere in the world, and rightly so. But we also have reasons to be concerned about some current trends within EU borders. Let\u2019s look for instance into the undemocratic reaction Spain has taken in order to stop Catalonia\u2019s democratic self-determination. Every time fundamental values are violated in the Union the EU must be there to react and to help. But these violations should also be prevented, and this instrument will be good for that. Finally, I think further steps should be taken in the promotion of fundamental rights by making the European Charter of Fundamental Rights directly applicable in all areas and all Member States. 4-327-5000 Tibor Szanyi (S&amp;D), \u00edr\u00e1sban. \u2012 Szavazatommal t\u00e1mogattam az EP hat\u00e1rozat\u00e1t egy olyan \u00faj p\u00e9nz\u00fcgyi eszk\u00f6z l\u00e9trehoz\u00e1s\u00e1r\u00f3l, amely az eur\u00f3pai \u00e9rt\u00e9kek v\u00e9delm\u00e9t \u00e9s el\u0151mozd\u00edt\u00e1s\u00e1t c\u00e9lul t\u0171z\u0151 civil szervezetek t\u00e1mogat\u00e1s\u00e1t szolg\u00e1lja.

I believe that the EU needs to foster social capital and the third sector, establishing innovative manners and ways and types to foster horizontal and non-for-profit endeavours. A well-developed civil society constitutes the best protection against an erosion of values, something that we are currently seeing in Catalonia. The stronger the civil society, the freer the individual. CSOs promote these values despite facing growing difficulties in terms of funding and communication. Moreover, the EU should provide funding to CSOs operating in third countries to foster these values. 4-327-8125 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 Esta proposta n\u00e3o est\u00e1 desligada da crise da e na Uni\u00e3o Europeia cujos mais recentes desenvolvimentos a p\u00f5em abertamente em quest\u00e3o junto dos povos da Europa.

It does not contain politicised text, nor does it call for further European Union actions. I therefore abstained on amendments which - whilst I agreed with them - are likely to be unhelpful in that respect. I do not support Turkish accession to the European Union, but this is not the place to say so.

Gr\u010dka je priop\u0107ila kako su dva vojnika na ophodnji gr\u010dko-turske granice slu\u010dajno u\u0161li u Tursku zbog lo\u0161eg vremena, a na tom podru\u010dju je u tom periodu zabilje\u017een te\u0161ki snijeg i magla. Turska ih je unato\u010d tome zadr\u017eala u pritvoru i odredila im su\u0111enje. Unato\u010d intervenciji EU-a, turski sud je presudio kako ne\u0107e osloboditi dvojicu gr\u010dkih vojnika optu\u017eenih za \u0161pijuna\u017eu i nezakonit ulazak u zemlju. Kako se radi o o\u010ditom kr\u0161enju ljudskih prava, ovim putem pozivamo turske vlasti da ubrzaju zatvaranje sudbenog procesa i osloba\u0111anje dva gr\u010dka vojnika te da ih vrate u Gr\u010dku. Nadalje, Turska mora slijediti pravne postupke i procedure i u potpunosti po\u0161tivati ljudska prava sadr\u017eana u me\u0111unarodnom pravu, uklju\u010duju\u0107i i \u017denevsku konvenciju.

Prema navodima gr\u010dkih vlasti, vojnici su tijekom nadgledavanja stanja na granici slu\u010dajno pre\u0161li granicu, a Turska njihovim uhi\u0107enjem \u017eeli pokazati svoju mo\u0107. S druge strane, turski predsjednik Erdogan optu\u017euje Gr\u010dku \u0161to nije izru\u010dila osam turskih vojnika koji su pobjegli u Gr\u010dku nakon neuspjelog dr\u017eavnog udara.

Podr\u017eavam ovu rezoluciju i sla\u017eem se sa stavom da bi Turska i Gr\u010dka trebale sura\u0111ivati na svim poljima te smanjiti me\u0111usobne tenzije. Stoga pozivam turske vlasti da puste na slobodu gr\u010dke vojnike i vrate ih u njihovu dr\u017eavu. 4-326-8750 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 On 4 March 2018 a Turkish court in Edirne, old Adrianopolis, ruled that two soldiers, who are currently being held in maximum security detention and are accused of illegally entering Turkey, should still be detained. These two Greek soldiers have been held in a Turkish prison for more than one month without charges being brought against them, leaving them unaware of the crime of which they are accused. I support this motion. Previous cases of similar accidental crossings of the border by either Greek or Turkish soldiers were settled in the past on the spot at the level of the local military authorities of both sides. We need a good entente between these two countries, and be aside Greece, a Member State of the EU. 4-326-9375 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 O caso em quest\u00e3o \u00e9 mais um epis\u00f3dio na tensa rela\u00e7\u00e3o existente entre estes dois pa\u00edses onde pontuam diversos pontos de diverg\u00eancia e de conflito.

Concordo com a necessidade de dinamizar plataformas de partilha de boas pr\u00e1ticas como a COSAC e o IPEX. Acompanho a sugest\u00e3o de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um mecanismo parlamentar de acompanhamento do Semestre Europeu, considerando a rela\u00e7\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica entre parlamentos nacionais e controlo or\u00e7amental. Subscrevo o entendimento de uma abordagem baseada nas comiss\u00f5es parlamentares para a coopera\u00e7\u00e3o Parlamento Europeu - Parlamentos Nacionais. Exemplo paradigm\u00e1tico \u00e9 a necessidade imperativa de contar com a vis\u00e3o dos parlamentos nacionais na perspetiva de uma Uni\u00e3o Europeia de Defesa e no dom\u00ednio da Liberdade, Seguran\u00e7a e Justi\u00e7a. Concordo com a ideia de uma \u201cSemana Europeia\u201d, com o objetivo de aproximar decisores pol\u00edticos europeus e nacionais, preservando a diversidade de vis\u00f5es presentes nos parlamentos nacionais. Destaco a necessidade de debater a efic\u00e1cia do sistema de controlo da subsidiariedade, sobretudo do sistema de alerta precoce. 4-329-3437 Jo\u00e3o Ferreira (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 Este relat\u00f3rio tenta ocultar uma evid\u00eancia: o Tratado de Lisboa representou um fort\u00edssimo ataque ao poder dos parlamentos nacionais, uma vez que compet\u00eancias que eram suas foram usurpadas para a esfera da Uni\u00e3o Europeia. Nos \u00faltimos anos - com o Tratado Or\u00e7amental, o Semestre Europeu e o pacote da Governa\u00e7\u00e3o Econ\u00f3mica - esta usurpa\u00e7\u00e3o foi levada ainda mais longe. Este relat\u00f3rio, no fundo, procura legitimar esta usurpa\u00e7\u00e3o. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao Semestre Europeu, por exemplo, sem contestar a ilegitimidade da intromiss\u00e3o das institui\u00e7\u00f5es da UE em mat\u00e9ria do foro nacional, como a elabora\u00e7\u00e3o e aprova\u00e7\u00e3o dos or\u00e7amentos de Estado, procura conferir aos parlamentos nacionais um papel de espectadores nesse intoler\u00e1vel processo de intromiss\u00e3o. Procura, de alguma forma, institucionalizar esse papel com a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um \u201ctrimestre nacional\u201d, proposta que ro\u00e7a o rid\u00edculo. O papel que alegadamente o Tratado atribui aos Parlamentos Nacionais - o da fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do princ\u00edpio da subsidiariedade - n\u00e3o passa de uma farsa, estando bem \u00e0 vista a sua inutilidade: mesmo nos casos em que os Parlamentos levantam obje\u00e7\u00f5es, a Comiss\u00e3o Europeia ignora essas obje\u00e7\u00f5es e mant\u00e9m as suas propostas. Este relat\u00f3rio insere-se nesta farsa. Refor\u00e7a uma certa conce\u00e7\u00e3o de adorno dos parlamentos nacionais e tenta dar uma apar\u00eancia democr\u00e1tica a tudo isto. Debalde.

Nacionalni parlamenti u njemu su prepoznati kao kameni temeljci demokratskog legitimiteta Europske unije, a usvojeni su brojni pozitivni prijedlozi kao \u0161to su: procedura prema kojoj nacionalni parlamenti mogu pozvati Komisiju na poduzimanje zakonodavne inicijative; uskla\u0111ivanje Europskog semestra s radom nacionalnih parlamenata kako bi se koordinirala ekonomska politika te implementirao dijalog o prora\u010dunu s obveznim sustavom povezanosti nacionalnih vlada s institucijama Unije; suzdr\u017eavanje Komisije u preuskim interpretacijama principa supsidijarnosti dok istodobno prijenos i proporcionalnost nisu uzeti u obzir unutar sustava ranog uzbunjivanja; dodavanje razdoblja tehni\u010dke obavijesti unutar sustava ranog uzbunjivanja kako bi se omogu\u0107ilo pro\u0161irivanje perioda od osam tjedana za izdavanje obrazlo\u017eenog mi\u0161ljenja; interparlamentarna suradnja izme\u0111u odbora Europskog parlamenta te odbora nacionalnih parlamenata itd. 4-329-3906 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 I support this initiative. It mentions the probable creation of a green card awarding national parliaments a sort of instrument within the field of legislative initiative. This innovation would have three limits: it cannot be a true legislative initiative, as this is a right exclusively reserved to the Commission; it cannot be used in relation to the repeal of existing EU law as it would otherwise act as a reverse red card; it should not incorporate any right to amendment European legislation. The idea is to reflect the right understanding of subsidiarity, to the extent that it means that national parliaments recognise that some matters are of exclusive competence of the EU. 4-329-4062 Anneleen Van Bossuyt (ECR), schriftelijk. \u2012 Omdat dit verslag zich strikt houdt aan de bestaande verdragsbepalingen, worden er geen extra bindende rode of groene kaarten in het kader van de subsidiariteitscontrole door de nationale parlementen voorgesteld. Toch beschouwt de N-VAdelegatie dit verslag als een stap in de goede richting van een effectievere betrokkenheid van de nationale parlementen bij het EU-besluitvormingsproces en van een sterkere erkenning van het politiek pluralisme. De N-VA-delegatie hecht er sterk aan dat ook deelstaatparlementen met wetgevende bevoegdheid ten volle bij de hier behandelde procedures en samenwerking worden betrokken. Zij wijst hierbij op het voorbeeld van Belgi\u00eb, dat bij de ondertekening van het Verdrag van Lissabon een verklaring heeft afgelegd, die aangeeft dat de parlementen van zijn deelstaten, in functie van de bevoegdheden die zij en de EU uitoefenen, optreden als componenten van het nationaal parlementair stelsel. 4-329-4375 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 Este relat\u00f3rio, cujo relator \u00e9 um deputado do PSD, procura apresentar solu\u00e7\u00f5es dentro do Tratado de Lisboa e demais tratados e dentro tamb\u00e9m do refor\u00e7o do projeto de integra\u00e7\u00e3o capitalista europeu, para \u201cprovar\u201d que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel os parlamentos nacionais serem mais envolvidos nas pol\u00edticas comunit\u00e1rias.

ZPP ima za cilj osigurati pravi standard za poljoprivrednu zajednicu u uvjetima stalnih ekonomskih i klimatskih rizika, a politika tr\u017ei\u0161nog natjecanja uglavnom brani interese potro\u0161a\u010da i ne uzima dovoljno ra\u010duna o specifi\u010dnim interesima i pote\u0161ko\u0107ama poljoprivrednih proizvo\u0111a\u010da.

As you know, it sends a strong political message to the Commission. Some of the competition problems are the same than five years ago. Among those, the Google antitrust case. Five years in the Google case seems eternity. We strongly supports the independence of the Commission and the national competition authorities: Their mission is to enforce effectively EU competition rules for the benefit of all EU citizens. Sufficient financial and human resources is key to achieve this goal. We denounce the utilisation and misuse of data for some years now. Paragraph 44 of this report, written well before the Facebook scandal, states that: \u2018Big tech companies\u2019 use of personal data is unprecedented. Consumers are often not aware or informed of the extent to which their data is being used, for example in profiling or targeted advertising\u2019. The New GDPR rules that come into force are a good news. Regarding the Google antitrust shopping case, in paragraph 42 we put the unbundling of Google back on the table, as one of the options to restore equal treatment and non-discrimination in search results. We also invite Google CEO in a joint IMCO-ECON hearing. 4-329-9843 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 Neste relat\u00f3rio, ao mesmo tempo que se exige maior responsabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o e transpar\u00eancia das empresas, e para combater a evas\u00e3o fiscal, o conluio e os monop\u00f3lios - aspetos positivos -, continuam por abordar s\u00e9rios entorses \u00e0 concorr\u00eancia, em sectores como a agricultura, fomentados por pol\u00edticas como a PAC, e que arrasam produ\u00e7\u00f5es nacionais, continuando firmemente a aposta no quadro da promo\u00e7\u00e3o da liberaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e da privatiza\u00e7\u00e3o.

Lamento, por isso, que o custo do \u201cpacote de vacina\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d de uma crian\u00e7a tenha aumentado insistentemente nos \u00faltimos anos e que a Europa seja uma das regi\u00f5es com maior hesita\u00e7\u00e3o na popula\u00e7\u00e3o face \u00e0 vacina\u00e7\u00e3o, o que nos leva \u00e0 triste realidade de 215 mil casos de doen\u00e7as verificadas na Europa que poderiam ter sido evitadas, entre 2008 e 2015. Esta realidade prejudica o cumprimento do objetivo de desenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidos de \u201cAssegurar uma vida saud\u00e1vel e promover o bem-estar para todos, em todas as idades\u201d.

Acompanho, tamb\u00e9m, as sugest\u00f5es aos Estados-Membros para incrementar a informa\u00e7\u00e3o sobre vantagens da vacina\u00e7\u00e3o aos cidad\u00e3os, as pol\u00edticas de vacina\u00e7\u00e3o obrigat\u00f3ria dos profissionais de sa\u00fade e pol\u00edticas de regula\u00e7\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os de determinadas vacinas.

Odbijanje cijepljenja ima izravnu posljedicu povratka dje\u010djih bolesti koje su bile gotovo iskorijenjene, poput ospica i rubeole. Iako je ta situacija najkriti\u010dnija u Italiji i Rumunjskoj, i ostale dr\u017eave \u010dlanice suo\u010davaju se s problemom povratka tih zaraznih bolesti koje mogu imati te\u0161ke posljedice. Tako primjerice u Hrvatskoj od 2012. do 2017. godine protiv ospica, rubeole i zau\u0161njaka nije cijepljeno osam posto pred\u0161kolske djece te postoji opasnost od epidemije ospica i hripavca, posebice u Dubrova\u010dkoneretvanskoj, Splitsko-dalmatinskoj i Primorsko-goranskoj \u017eupaniji. S obzirom da smatram da treba promicati najbolje prakse i pokrenuti kampanje komunikacije i podizanja svijesti o va\u017enosti cijepljenja u spre\u010davanju zaraznih bolesti, podr\u017eala sam ovu rezoluciju. 4-342-4375 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 I support this initiative as it poses the focus on the growing and preoccupying vaccine hesitancy and drop in vaccination rates in Europe. It is important to acknowledge that the cost of a full vaccines package for one child, even at the lowest global prices, increased by a factor of 68 between 2001 and 2014, and this price increase is unjustifiable and incompatible with the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing at all ages, Within the EU and the EEA, countries vary considerably in relation to recommended vaccines. EU Member States have all endorsed the WHO\u2019s European Vaccine Action Plan 2015-2020. The decline in vaccination acceptance in Europe has led to noteworthy measles outbursts and related deaths in some European countries, something that we have to prevent as much as possible. 4-342-5000 Miguel Viegas (GUE/NGL), por escrito. \u2012 Sendo verdade qua a vacina\u00e7\u00e3o dificilmente chega a 100% da popula\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m um facto ineg\u00e1vel que quanto maior for o n\u00famero de vacinados, maior a prote\u00e7\u00e3o conferida, inclusive aos n\u00e3o vacinados, o que se define por imunidade de grupo. Onde foi parar a difteria? A rub\u00e9ola cong\u00e9nita? O t\u00e9tano neonatal? Se em 2016 Portugal foi reconhecido oficialmente como estando livre de sarampo, depara-se agora com o terceiro surto da doen\u00e7a no espa\u00e7o desses dois anos. N\u00e3o precisamos de enunciar muito para deixar claro que as vacinas s\u00e3o o maior presente que a medicina ofereceu \u00e0 humanidade. No entanto, apesar dos ineg\u00e1veis resultados positivos, nunca estiveram t\u00e3o ativos, no mundo todo, grupos contr\u00e1rios \u00e0s vacinas.

Las \u00f3rdenes de protecci\u00f3n est\u00e1n destinadas a proteger a una persona frente a actos que pueden poner en peligro su vida, su integridad f\u00edsica o psicol\u00f3gica, su dignidad, su libertad individual o su integridad sexual. Todos los Estados miembros ofrecen alg\u00fan tipo de orden de protecci\u00f3n penal o civil. No obstante, a pesar de una aparente similitud en la forma en que se dictan estas medidas, existe una gran diversidad de medidas entre los Estados miembros. Adem\u00e1s, la forma en que se aplican difiere considerablemente en la pr\u00e1ctica. Esta evaluaci\u00f3n muestra que para una protecci\u00f3n eficaz de las v\u00edctimas es necesario que el procedimiento de aprobaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n de una OEP sea r\u00e1pido. Tambi\u00e9n son importantes la coordinaci\u00f3n y la comunicaci\u00f3n entre las autoridades competentes y las autoridades centrales para la protecci\u00f3n de las v\u00edctimas y la eficacia de las OEP. Voto a favor de este informe que, en mi opini\u00f3n, suscita temas importantes para una buena aplicaci\u00f3n de la orden europea de protecci\u00f3n. 4-346-5312 Marijana Petir (PPE), napisan. \u2012 Izvje\u0161\u0107e o provedbi Direktive 2011/99/EU o europskom nalogu za za\u0161titu procjenjuje kako se u dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama primjenjuje mehanizam uspostavljen Direktivom, to\u010dnije osobama kojima je odobren nalog za za\u0161titu u kaznenim stvarima izdan u jednoj dr\u017eavi \u010dlanici omogu\u0107uje se da zatra\u017ee europski nalog za za\u0161titu. Budu\u0107i da je do danas izdano samo sedam europskih naloga za za\u0161titu, zabrinjavaju\u0107e je vrlo ograni\u010deno kori\u0161tenje tog instrumenta s obzirom na broj \u017ertava koje se koriste mjerama za\u0161tite u kaznenim stvarima na razini dr\u017eava \u010dlanica. Nalozi za za\u0161titu namijenjeni su za\u0161titi osoba od dijela koja mogu ugroziti njihov \u017eivot, fizi\u010dki ili psihi\u010dki integritet, dostojanstvo ili osobnu slobodu. Cilj je izbje\u0107i kontakt izme\u0111u po\u010dinitelja kaznenog djela i \u017ertve ili osobe koja je u opasnosti od napada, a za efektivnu za\u0161titu \u017ertava potreban je brz postupak za usvajanje i izvr\u0161enje europskih naloga za za\u0161titu. Podupirem ovo izvje\u0161\u0107e te stavljam naglasak na \u010dinjenicu kako je potrebno osposobljavanje stru\u010dnih osoba za koje je vjerojatno da \u0107e do\u0107i u kontakt sa \u017ertvama kojima su potrebne za\u0161titne mjere. 4-346-5625 Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 (ECR), napisan. \u2012 Direktiva o europskom nalogu za za\u0161titu kreirana je s namjerom pru\u017eanja onakve vrste za\u0161tite \u017ertvama nasilja u svim dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama Unije kakvu bi \u017eene primile u svojim doma\u0107im dr\u017eavama. Iako je implementirana jo\u0161 2016., samo je sedam ovakvih naloga uistinu pokrenuto, od \u010dega su \u010detiri pokrenuta u \u0160panjolskoj. Tako slaba implementacija zna\u010di kako EPRS studija ima vrlo deficitarne informacije za pripremanje implementacijskog izvje\u0161\u0107a. Nastavno na navedeno, izvje\u0161\u0107e tra\u017ei: centralni EPO registar, trening za policijske i pravosudne slu\u017ebenike koji bi im osvijestio ovaj alat, pove\u0107anu pravnu asistenciju kako bi \u017ertve bile u mogu\u0107nosti tra\u017eiti kompenzaciju na koju imaju pravo, efikasniju implementaciju ovog sustava, suradnju s nevladinim organizacijama itd. Dok se na jednoj strani navode neki hvale vrijedni ciljevi za\u0161tite \u017ertava nasilja, izvje\u0161\u0107e ujedno promovira i naslanja se na mnoge ciljeve Istanbulske konvencije kojoj se o\u0161tro protivim zbog zatiranja suverenosti nacionalnih dr\u017eava te promoviranja rodne ideologije te sam stoga glasovala suzdr\u017eano. 4-346-6250 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 The Commission did not submit a report on the application of the European Protection Order Directive and I support this draft denouncing this issue. Entered into force in 2015, this directive needed data collection, which has not been done neither by the Commission nor the agencies nor even by NGOs in order to assess the use of this instrument at EU level. One of the major problems of the EU is that it seems not to be able to implement its own legislation: there is a deep difference between the legislation objective and the legislative implementation. 4-346-7500 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Zdechovsk\u00fd (PPE), p\u00edsemn\u011b. \u2012 Hlasoval jsem jednozna\u010dn\u011b pro tuto zpr\u00e1vu, kter\u00e1 se t\u00fdk\u00e1 justi\u010dn\u00ed spolupr\u00e1ce v trestn\u00edch v\u011bcech.

W kontek\u015bcie tworzenia Europejskiej Przestrzeni Edukacyjnej konieczne jest wykorzystanie potencja\u0142u i do\u015bwiadcze\u0144 Europejskiego Obszaru Szkolnictwa Wy\u017cszego (EHEA) oraz stworzenie nowych, komplementarnych inicjatyw, kt\u00f3re pozwol\u0105 na wzmocnienie i dalszy rozw\u00f3j zar\u00f3wno Europejskiej Przestrzeni Edukacyjnej, jaki i EHEA. Istotne jest tak\u017ce \u015bci\u015blejsze powi\u0105zanie EHEA i Europejskiej Przestrzeni Badawczej. Zwracam tak\u017ce uwag\u0119 na wymiar spo\u0142eczny procesu bolo\u0144skiego. Wyzwaniem dla procesu bolo\u0144skiego pozostaje w dalszym ci\u0105gu zapewnienie r\u00f3wnych szans w zakresie dost\u0119pu do edukacji i mi\u0119dzynarodowej mobilno\u015bci dla grup defaworyzowanych. Istotne s\u0105 tak\u017ce dzia\u0142ania na rzecz wi\u0119kszej mobilno\u015bci pracownik\u00f3w uczelni (naukowych i administracyjnych) oraz zwi\u0119kszenie oferty oraz dost\u0119pu do edukacji ustawicznej. 4-349-8125 Marijana Petir (PPE), napisan. \u2012 Rezolucija Europskog parlamenta o provedbi Bolonjskog procesa \u2013 trenuta\u010dno stanje i daljnje aktivnosti poti\u010de potpunu i jednaku provedbu Bolonjskog procesa u svim dr\u017eavama \u010dlanicama. Zemlje sudionice trebaju pove\u0107ati politi\u010dki anga\u017eman i poticati me\u0111usobnu suradnju u provedbi zajedni\u010dki dogovorenih ciljeva diljem Europskog prostora visokog obrazovanja (EHEA) te istodobno ja\u010dati prilike za mobilnost s ciljem osiguranja uklju\u010divanja najve\u0107eg mogu\u0107eg broja studenata. Tako\u0111er, potrebno je olak\u0161avanje priznavanja akademskih studijskih razdoblja i kredita ste\u010denih u inozemstvu, kao i kvalifikacija za akademske i stru\u010dne svrhe i prethodno u\u010denje te razvijanje sustava osiguranja kvalitete. Europska unija, dr\u017eave \u010dlanice i sveu\u010dili\u0161ta trebaju uspostaviti aran\u017emane za pru\u017eanje financijske i administrativne potpore studentima, akademicima i osoblju s nepovoljnim pozadinama kroz odgovaraju\u0107e financiranje, uklju\u010duju\u0107i sudjelovanje u shemama mobilnosti i daljnje otvaranje pristupa visokom obrazovanju \u0161irenjem mogu\u0107nosti cjelo\u017eivotnog u\u010denja na akademskoj razini. Podr\u017eavam dono\u0161enje ove Rezolucije zato \u0161to treba naglasiti va\u017enost poticanja sudjelovanja studenata, istra\u017eiva\u010da, nastavnika i izvan nastavnog osoblja u visokom \u0161kolstvu te u mobilnosti s drugim europskim sveu\u010dili\u0161tima. 4-349-8750 Ru\u017ea Toma\u0161i\u0107 (ECR), napisan. \u2012 Sveobuhvatni cilj bolonjskog procesa kreiranje je Europskog prostora visokog obrazovanja (EHEA) baziranog na me\u0111unarodnoj suradnji i akademskoj razmjeni, koja je atraktivna za europske studente. To je u su\u0161tini kolektivni rad i trud koji ula\u017eu javni autoriteti, sveu\u010dili\u0161ta, u\u010ditelji, studenti, poslodavci, agencije koje jam\u010de kvalitetu, me\u0111unarodne organizacije te institucije. Svrha bolonjskog procesa osiguravanje je usporednog, kompatibilnog te koherentnog sustava visokog obrazovanja u Europi, \u0161to je svakako hvalevrijedna agenda koja zaslu\u017euje svesrdnu podr\u0161ku. Rezolucija je dobila moju potporu jer je za cilj uzela ohrabrivanje dr\u017eava \u010dlanica koje sudjeluju u procesu kako bi iste bile u mogu\u0107nosti unaprijediti suradnju, u\u010dvrstiti dijalog te ulagati konstantne napore u procjene obrazovnog sustava na snazi. 4-349-9375 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE), in writing. \u2012 The Bologna Process is an intergovernmental initiative with which Member States aim to achieve, through open and collaborative dialogue, common goals through internationally agreed commitments and contribute to the construction of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). I support it as the Bologna Process has promoted mobility by pleasing to the eye of the internationalisation of higher education and cultivating the compatibility and comparability of standards of different higher education systems, while regarding the principles of academic freedom and institutional self-sufficiency and focusing on solidifying the quality of higher education and offering equal opportunities for citizens.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS1406169I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5N-W8W1-JDG9-Y4M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"17684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That stat comes from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch who published this chart a while ago: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Regs1.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Regs1.jpg</url> This is confirmed by similar charts, such as this one from Benedict Evans, a Partner at the firm Andreessen Horowitz, who just shared his Davos presentation.Every year I do a big macro presentation. This year, #8216;Standing on the shoulders of giants'; we connected everyone (!), and wonder what's next, but meanwhile, connecting everyone means we connected all the problems. Tech is becoming a regulated industry       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/7v8Hcmulf8\">https://t.co/7v8Hcmulf8</url>[1] \u2014 Benedict Evans (@benedictevans) January 28, 2020[2]In the middle of it is this chart:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Regs2.jpg;\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Regs2.jpg;</url> Yep, banks and financial firms have more regulations than airlines and pharma, and a lot more than tech firms. Add onto this that if you're a global financial platform, like a JPMorgan or HSBC, that regulations change ever twelve minutes[3], and that's a real headache. Equally, the light regulation of technology giants like Facebook in the USA, is a reflection of lobbying in Washington, or so insiders claim[4]. Therefore, it intrigued me to pick up The Sunday Times and find a headline: Big Tech likes rules, so long as it writes them[5] there were a few interesting stats in there, such as Amazon being the top lobbying firm, spending $16.8 million in 2019 to run a 100-strong team of people to crawl all over the politicians. That's the cost of the people, not the cost of paying off the politicians which would run to millions more. Even so, it's just peanuts in the annual revenues of Amazon.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amazon.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Amazon.jpg</url> Similarly Facebook spent $16.7 million on 71 people in Washington whilst Google dropped to ninth, with just $12.7 million spent on lobbyists, according to figures from the Centre for Responsive Politics. Their main activities? Avoid the break up of the Big Tech giants and protect Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). CDA was passed in 1996, when just 10% of Americans used the internet, and gave website owners immunity from any legal action as a result of content posted by their users. This is the cornerstone of what has allowed the Big Tech giants become giants, and there's no way they want that situation changed. Interestingly, Ben Evans concludes his Davos presentation with a focus upon these areas (see slide 72 onwards in his presentation[6]). And concludes that the internet is global, not American, and so even if the US authorities change Section 230, you'll still have companies like TikTok out of China running outside the rules. Nevertheless, the banking system still deals with the high cost overheads of regs.        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Compliance-cosst.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Compliance-cosst.jpg</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dodd-Frank.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dodd-Frank.jpg</url> No wonder the tech firms want to keep the rules, write the rules and run the rules and, with their armies of lobbyists, they are doing a pretty good job of keeping it that way.

O fundador do Facebook faz parte de um n\u00e3o-brainer que os f\u00e3s de ambos os lados do espectro intencionalmente esquecem: um equil\u00edbrio deve ser buscado entre liberdade de express\u00e3o e seguran\u00e7a, privacidade e aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da lei. </p><p>Aumentar a censura com base na prote\u00e7\u00e3o dos cidad\u00e3os pode facilmente restringir as liberdades democr\u00e1ticas. N\u00e3o regular em tudo pode fazer da Internet um para\u00edso para ped\u00f3filos, terroristas e criminosos, ou uma t\u00e1bua de som para discursos de \u00f3dio. As mesmas raz\u00f5es que, na \u00e9poca, deram origem \u00e0 regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o do conte\u00fado de transmiss\u00e3o s\u00e3o aquelas que agora est\u00e3o sendo discutidas na Europa e que para nossos legisladores e reguladores parecem distantes e inating\u00edveis, como se ainda estivessem vivendo nos anos 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al\u00e9m do artigo de Zuckerberg, o Facebook fez uma s\u00e9rie de propostas regulat\u00f3rias \u00e0 Comiss\u00e3o Europeia, que ele pr\u00f3prio resumiu como um lugar intermedi\u00e1rio entre os jornais, que s\u00e3o totalmente respons\u00e1veis pelo que publicam, e empresas de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, que n\u00e3o assumem nenhuma responsabilidade pelo conte\u00fado das comunica\u00e7\u00f5es que atropelam suas redes. Deve-se notar que este, no caso do M\u00e9xico, n\u00e3o \u00e9 o caso. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos jornais, o principal respons\u00e1vel \u00e9 o autor do texto e, em qualquer caso, o jornal teria apenas uma responsabilidade civil subsidi\u00e1ria e que em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao direito de resposta. Por sua vez, no caso das empresas de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, devemos distinguir entre comunica\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal mente, na qual, de fato, a empresa de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o tem responsabilidade pelo que essas pessoas dizem umas \u00e0s outras, e o televis\u00e3o restrita, por exemplo, em que tanto a empresa quanto os canais de programa\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam certas responsabilidades para o conte\u00fado. Por fim, deve-se lembrar que, como j\u00e1 expliquei neste espa\u00e7o de acordo com a lei mexicana, as plataformas de Internet s\u00e3o empresas de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanto o artigo de Zuckerberg quanto a proposta do Facebook ocorrem em um ambiente onde a Comiss\u00e3o Europeia emitir\u00e1 regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o sobre Intelig\u00eancia Artificial e elevar\u00e1 o n\u00edvel de responsabilidade das plataformas de conte\u00fado online com o Nova Lei de Servi\u00e7os Digitais prevista para o final de 2020. Por sua vez, o governo brit\u00e2nico est\u00e1 trabalhando na legisla\u00e7\u00e3o para dar \u00e0 Ofcom, o regulador de telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e radiodifus\u00e3o, o poder de regular e monitorar o conte\u00fado das plataformas online, particularmente como faz com Direitos das crian\u00e7as, discurso de \u00f3dio, pornografia e terrorismo. O que \u00e9 impressionante \u00e9 que tanto na Uni\u00e3o Europeia quanto no Reino Unido est\u00e3o considerando grandes plataformas na Internet como radiodifus\u00e3o, \u00e0 medida que uma mensagem atinge uma audi\u00eancia de centenas de milh\u00f5es.

Es un art\u00edculo inteligente que trata de encauzar la regulaci\u00f3n de contenidos distribuidos masivamente a trav\u00e9s de plataformas de Internet, sobre todo en la Uni\u00f3n Europea y el Reino Unido. El fundador de Facebook parte de una obviedad que los fan\u00e1ticos de ambos lados del espectro olvidan de manera intencional: se debe buscar un balance entre la libertad de expresi\u00f3n y la seguridad, la privacidad y el cumplimiento de la ley. </p><p>Elevar la censura bajo el argumento de proteger al ciudadano puede f\u00e1cilmente restringir las libertades democr\u00e1ticas. No regular en lo absoluto puede hacer del Internet un para\u00edso para ped\u00f3filos, terroristas y criminales, o bien una caja de resonancia para discursos de odio. Las mismas razones que en su momento dieron lugar a la regulaci\u00f3n de los contenidos radiodifundidos son las que hoy se discuten en Europa y que para nuestros legisladores y reguladores parecen lejanas e inalcanzables, como si siguieran viviendo en los 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adem\u00e1s del art\u00edculo de Zuckerberg, Facebook hizo una serie de propuestas de regulaci\u00f3n a la Comisi\u00f3n Europea, que \u00e9l mismo resumi\u00f3 como un lugar intermedio entre los peri\u00f3dicos, que son completamente responsables de lo que publican, y las empresas de telecomunicaciones, que no asumen responsabilidad alguna por el contenido de las comunicaciones que corren por sus redes. Cabe se\u00f1alar que esto, en el caso de M\u00e9xico, no es as\u00ed. Respecto a los peri\u00f3dicos, el principal responsable es el autor del texto y, en todo caso, el peri\u00f3dico s\u00f3lo tendr\u00eda una responsabilidad civil subsidiaria y aquella en materia de derecho de r\u00e9plica. Por su parte, en el caso de las empresas de telecomunicaciones, debemos distinguir entre la comunicaci\u00f3n persona a persona, en la que, efectivamente, la empresa de telecomunicaciones no tiene responsabilidad alguna por lo que se digan entre s\u00ed esas personas, y la televisi\u00f3n restringida, por ejemplo, en la que tanto la empresa como los canales de programaci\u00f3n tienen ciertas responsabilidades por el contenido. Por \u00faltimo, cabe recordar que, como ya he explicado en este espacio de acuerdo con la ley mexicana, las plataformas de Internet son empresas de telecomunicaciones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanto el art\u00edculo de Zuckerberg como la propuesta de Facebook se dan en un entorno en el que la Comisi\u00f3n Europea emitir\u00e1 regulaci\u00f3n respecto a la Inteligencia Artificial y elevar\u00e1 el nivel de responsabilidad de las plataformas por Internet en materia de contenidos con la nueva Digital Services Act que se espera para finales del 2020.

Es un art\u00edculo inteligente que trata de encauzar la regulaci\u00f3n de contenidos distribuidos masivamente a trav\u00e9s de plataformas de Internet, sobre todo en la Uni\u00f3n Europea y el Reino Unido. El fundador de Facebook parte de una obviedad que los fan\u00e1ticos de ambos lados del espectro olvidan de manera intencional: se debe buscar un balance entre la libertad de expresi\u00f3n y la seguridad, la privacidad y el cumplimiento de la ley. </p><p>Elevar la censura bajo el argumento de proteger al ciudadano puede f\u00e1cilmente restringir las libertades democr\u00e1ticas. No regular en lo absoluto puede hacer del Internet un para\u00edso para ped\u00f3filos, terroristas y criminales, o bien una caja de resonancia para discursos de odio. Las mismas razones que en su momento dieron lugar a la regulaci\u00f3n de los contenidos radiodifundidos son las que hoy se discuten en Europa y que para nuestros legisladores y reguladores parecen lejanas e inalcanzables, como si siguieran viviendo en los 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adem\u00e1s del art\u00edculo de Zuckerberg, Facebook hizo una serie de propuestas de regulaci\u00f3n a la Comisi\u00f3n Europea, que \u00e9l mismo resumi\u00f3 como un lugar intermedio entre los peri\u00f3dicos, que son completamente responsables de lo que publican, y las empresas de telecomunicaciones, que no asumen responsabilidad alguna por el contenido de las comunicaciones que corren por sus redes. Cabe se\u00f1alar que esto, en el caso de M\u00e9xico, no es as\u00ed. Respecto a los peri\u00f3dicos, el principal responsable es el autor del texto y, en todo caso, el peri\u00f3dico s\u00f3lo tendr\u00eda una responsabilidad civil subsidiaria y aquella en materia de derecho de r\u00e9plica. Por su parte, en el caso de las empresas de telecomunicaciones, debemos distinguir entre la comunicaci\u00f3n persona a persona, en la que, efectivamente, la empresa de telecomunicaciones no tiene responsabilidad alguna por lo que se digan entre s\u00ed esas personas, y la televisi\u00f3n restringida, por ejemplo, en la que tanto la empresa como los canales de programaci\u00f3n tienen ciertas responsabilidades por el contenido. Por \u00faltimo, cabe recordar que, como ya he explicado en este espacio de acuerdo con la ley mexicana, las plataformas de Internet son empresas de telecomunicaciones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanto el art\u00edculo de Zuckerberg como la propuesta de Facebook se dan en un entorno en el que la Comisi\u00f3n Europea emitir\u00e1 regulaci\u00f3n respecto a la Inteligencia Artificial y elevar\u00e1 el nivel de responsabilidad de las plataformas por Internet en materia de contenidos con la nueva Digital Services Act que se espera para finales del 2020. Por su parte, el gobierno del Reino Unido est\u00e1 trabajando en legislaci\u00f3n para otorgar a Ofcom, el regulador de las telecomunicaciones y la radiodifusi\u00f3n, facultades para regular y supervisar el contenido de las plataformas por Internet, particularmente por lo que hace a derechos de la ni\u00f1ez, discursos de odio, pornograf\u00eda y terrorismo.

Y lo central para comenzar la discusi\u00f3n de qu\u00e9 y c\u00f3mo se debe regular, es establecer las condiciones del juego y analizar los nuevos riesgos que emergen, y su posible impacto en la estabilidad financiera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>En primer lugar, la regulaci\u00f3n debe apuntar a igualar las condiciones de competencia entre los diferentes actores, para as\u00ed fomentar el desarrollo de la industria financiera de forma sostenible y competitiva.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Respecto de este punto, existe consenso entre las autoridades, agentes tradicionales y la propia asociaci\u00f3n de empresas Fintech Chile de que la regulaci\u00f3n debe estar basada en actividades, es decir, a igual actividad, id\u00e9ntica regulaci\u00f3n. Esto permite velar tanto por la estabilidad sist\u00e9mica como por la competencia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lo anterior cobra particular relevancia en el actual escenario. Un reciente documento elaborado por el Comit\u00e9 de Supervisi\u00f3n Bancaria de Basilea, respecto a las implicancias de los avances de las fintech, hace referencia a la capacidad de las empresas big tech -grandes empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas con actividad internacional, que disfrutan de una ventaja competitiva en el mundo de la tecnolog\u00eda digital- de hacerse r\u00e1pidamente con una significativa cuota de mercado.<br/><br/><br/><br/>La regulaci\u00f3n en este \u00e1mbito tiene importantes desaf\u00edos, para abordar de forma correcta los riesgos de una eventual concentraci\u00f3n de mercado y de asimetr\u00edas de informaci\u00f3n que se pueden generan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>En segundo lugar, en un mundo con mayores niveles de integraci\u00f3n, la regulaci\u00f3n debe ser transfronteriza, es decir, cumplir con los est\u00e1ndares internacionales.<br/><br/><br/><br/>El memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento de la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Comisiones de Valores recientemente suscrito por la CMF, es un excelente primer paso en esta direcci\u00f3n. Asimismo, el marco normativo debe ser flexible para tener la capacidad de adaptarse r\u00e1pidamente al constante cambio tecnol\u00f3gico.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Por \u00faltimo, la regulaci\u00f3n debe hacerse cargo de los riesgos operacionales y cibern\u00e9ticos. De hecho, en su \u00faltimo Informe de Estabilidad Financiera, el Banco Central se\u00f1al\u00f3 la relevancia que han adquirido estos riesgos debido a la velocidad de los avances tecnol\u00f3gicos y la interconexi\u00f3n de los servicios financieros.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Es fundamental que la regulaci\u00f3n vele por la igualdad de condiciones respecto a los diferentes servicios que prestan tanto las fintech como la industria financiera tradicional. Esta equivalencia es la que facilitar\u00e1 la innovaci\u00f3n, promoviendo la competencia y la estabilidad sist\u00e9mica.<br/><br/><br/><br/>La entrada Regulaci\u00f3n e innovaci\u00f3n, \u00bfamigas y rivales? se public\u00f3 primero en La Tercera.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PULSO-5089068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PULSO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TW8-97V1-JCMP-525X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443643</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Pulso, Chile Derechos reservados</copyright><publicationName>Pulso</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>3 diciembre 2018 lunes</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Peri\u00f3dico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Pulso</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Innovaci\u00c3\ufffdn</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Pulso Columnas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Regulaci\u00c3\ufffdn</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008WVM</classCode><className>Banking Institutions + Systems</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>Central Banks</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N522000CC</classCode><className>Banking, Lending + Credit Services</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Y lo central para comenzar la discusi\u00f3n de qu\u00e9 y c\u00f3mo se debe regular, es establecer las condiciones del juego y analizar los nuevos riesgos que emergen, y su posible impacto en la estabilidad financiera.<br/><br/><br/><br/>En primer lugar, la regulaci\u00f3n debe apuntar a igualar las condiciones de competencia entre los diferentes actores, para as\u00ed fomentar el desarrollo de la industria financiera de forma sostenible y competitiva.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Respecto de este punto, existe consenso entre las autoridades, agentes tradicionales y la propia asociaci\u00f3n de empresas Fintech Chile de que la regulaci\u00f3n debe estar basada en actividades, es decir, a igual actividad, id\u00e9ntica regulaci\u00f3n. Esto permite velar tanto por la estabilidad sist\u00e9mica como por la competencia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Lo anterior cobra particular relevancia en el actual escenario. Un reciente documento elaborado por el Comit\u00e9 de Supervisi\u00f3n Bancaria de Basilea, respecto a las implicancias de los avances de las fintech, hace referencia a la capacidad de las empresas big tech -grandes empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas con actividad internacional, que disfrutan de una ventaja competitiva en el mundo de la tecnolog\u00eda digital- de hacerse r\u00e1pidamente con una significativa cuota de mercado.<br/><br/><br/><br/>La regulaci\u00f3n en este \u00e1mbito tiene importantes desaf\u00edos, para abordar de forma correcta los riesgos de una eventual concentraci\u00f3n de mercado y de asimetr\u00edas de informaci\u00f3n que se pueden generan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>En segundo lugar, en un mundo con mayores niveles de integraci\u00f3n, la regulaci\u00f3n debe ser transfronteriza, es decir, cumplir con los est\u00e1ndares internacionales.<br/><br/><br/><br/>El memor\u00e1ndum de entendimiento de la Organizaci\u00f3n Internacional de Comisiones de Valores recientemente suscrito por la CMF, es un excelente primer paso en esta direcci\u00f3n. Asimismo, el marco normativo debe ser flexible para tener la capacidad de adaptarse r\u00e1pidamente al constante cambio tecnol\u00f3gico.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Por \u00faltimo, la regulaci\u00f3n debe hacerse cargo de los riesgos operacionales y cibern\u00e9ticos. De hecho, en su \u00faltimo Informe de Estabilidad Financiera, el Banco Central se\u00f1al\u00f3 la relevancia que han adquirido estos riesgos debido a la velocidad de los avances tecnol\u00f3gicos y la interconexi\u00f3n de los servicios financieros.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Es fundamental que la regulaci\u00f3n vele por la igualdad de condiciones respecto a los diferentes servicios que prestan tanto las fintech como la industria financiera tradicional. Esta equivalencia es la que facilitar\u00e1 la innovaci\u00f3n, promoviendo la competencia y la estabilidad sist\u00e9mica.<br/><br/><br/><br/>La entrada Regulaci\u00f3n e innovaci\u00f3n, \u00bfamigas y rivales? se public\u00f3 primero en La Tercera.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFES-5088483</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TW8-97V1-JCMP-51TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443648</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras Derechos reservados</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras Spanish</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>3 diciembre 2018 lunes</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Peri\u00f3dico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Pulso</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Innovaci\u00c3\ufffdn</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Pulso Columnas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className> Regulaci\u00c3\ufffdn</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008WVM</classCode><className>Banking Institutions + Systems</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>Central Banks</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N522000CC</classCode><className>Banking, Lending + Credit Services</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

How (if at all) should they be regulated'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mike Davie<br/>CEO<br/>Quadrant</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We need to be careful when suggesting new regulations, especially for social media platforms. We need to ensure any regulations that we put in place protect the consumer and doesn't just create walls that reduce competition. Smart regulations should ensure that Facebook users' data are not used for nefarious purposes yet should allow firms to be able to still use that data to do good, innovate and create new products and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Being a big company is not a bad thing and we should avoid calling for the breakup of Facebook because we are concerned about its monopoly power. I remember in the early 2000s there was a push to break up Microsoft along product lines due to claims that it was abusing its monopoly power with Internet Explorer. These efforts failed (although some regulations were put in place) and now the only reason people use Internet Explorer is to download Google Chrome or Mozilla. This is mainly due to competition, not government intervention, so we should be pushing more competition above all else.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Allan Tan<br/>Managing Partner<br/>Ying Communications</p><p>The challenge for regulators with Facebook or any social media platform is that knowledge is never evenly distributed: there will always exist the few who know how to use - and game - the platform to their advantage. These include the Kardashians, dictatorships, politicians, activists, Cambridge Analytica, the Myanmar military, communications agencies with the right skills, and Facebook itself.</p><p>Breaking up Facebook wouldn't address this root problem. Governments need a two-prong approach: first, make the platform responsible for the content its users put up, ie treat Facebook like a media company. Second, put in place laws that restrict the type of content that people can put up: opinions ok, hate speech not ok. These rules aren't new; we just need to bring Facebook under their ambit.</p><p>John Bittleston<br/>Founder and Chair<br/>Terrific Mentors International Pte Ltd</p><p>Splitting up a big business is not as easy as it sounds. Shared services including information is a foundation cost for many. Divided, you double costs and seriously affect the profits of both. Public companies' shareholders will be angry. Internal staff hates it too. Forcing the downsizing of a business is not clever.\u00a0Thus regulation is all the more important. Free speech is being badly abused. I don't like limiting what people can say but the impact of words is today greater than when I was born. It needs reining in, sensitively, with a careful watch that the regulations don't become a source of abuse.</p><p>Jayaprakash Jagateesan<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>RHT Holdings Pte Ltd</p><p>The aggregation of social media networks and the emergence of a monopoly in the hands of a single large shareholder leaves a lot to be desired in terms of governance. The concentration of power and influence held by a single shareholder not only lacks checks and balances, but also hinders competition and stifles innovation.</p><p>With no significant alternatives for users to switch to, the authorities need to step in to prevent users from being subjected to manipulative practices and malicious exploitation. However, government agencies will need to look beyond 20th century regulatory concepts designed for railroads and oil companies to police the latest technology platforms, products and services.</p><p>Naveen Menon<br/>President ASEAN<br/>Cisco</p><p>The debate on companies becoming too big and powerful is not a new one. However, I think we are focusing on the wrong question.</p><p>For years, we have been comfortable giving up our personal data in exchange for the right to communicate with our friends and family, or access online services and content. What we did not know, though, is how much of our data was being captured and monetised. As we have seen recently, many companies that took our data did not know what was happening either. That is a huge crisis of confidence.</p><p>What we really need is a unified framework in place that safeguards consumer data. This should address three key aspects: transparency, accountability, and empowerment.</p><p>Companies need to be transparent about how they use and manage data. That is because data often moves fluidly, not just within an organisation, but across companies and third parties. This is where accountability comes in. Regulators need to ensure that companies not only protect consumer data from any hacks, but also use it ethically. Finally, all stakeholders should work towards empowering individuals to have a say on the use of their data for meaningful transactions and experiences that are consistent with their expectations.</p><p>Kostas Anagnostakis<br/>Founder, Chief Executive Officer<br/>Niometrics</p><p>Only 31 per cent of consumers in Asia-Pacific believe that their personal data will be treated in a trustworthy manner by companies that offer digital services. Technology companies, big and small, have contributed to this distrust with the recent slew of data breaches that have compromised users' personal data.</p><p>Digital platforms have a responsibility to protect their users' privacy and data, but many have failed to do so. Expecting them to voluntarily regulate themselves has not worked either.</p><p>Tapping the knowledge field of privacy engineering, our technology encrypts data from the outset because privacy and security are non-negotiable. We have worked with many digital players to move closer to what customers today demand and require - a balance of data intelligence and insight without compromising their data.</p><p>Chris Burton<br/>MD, South East Asia<br/>Vistra Group</p><p>Monopolies are generally subject to challenge where a firm is the sole seller of a product or it has no close substitutes, so that firm can unfairly influence market prices. Facebook is not a monopoly in an economic sense. It is a platform, upon which content and ideas are shared by the hundreds of millions of individual participants. It is not even analogous to a media monopoly (where editorial views can be disproportionate), because it does not broadcast its own opinions. I do not see the point of breaking up the business on that basis. On regulation, I think yes: Facebook should be regulated to ensure it has implemented sufficient controls to prevent misuse by unscrupulous, extremist operators, and manipulators. Regulation should also ensure that decisions it takes to de-platform are sound and even-handed: Facebook should not de-platform participants just because the firm does not subscribe to a particular political opinion. Rather like the regulation of the BBC in the UK, Facebook must be seen as a neutral platform.</p><p>Mark Billington<br/>Regional Director, Greater China and South-East Asia<br/>ICAEW</p><p>Facebook's data scandal has brought to light the importance of establishing a set of guiding principles (or regulatory framework) to govern the collection and use of data by companies. While splitting up these Big Tech giants might seem like a straightforward solution, the question of accountability still needs to be addressed upfront. As it stands, the underlying problem stems from a lack of these common guiding principles that can address key ethical issues when dealing with personal data.</p><p>It is thus crucial that various stakeholders cooperate more closely before any decision is made on whether to regulate private organisations. Technology companies, regulators, academics, and the public should be constantly engaged and consulted, to ensure that everyone's interests are equally represented. Any regulation that is consequently introduced will then need to strike a fine balance between allowing for freedom of expression and protecting users from harmful content.</p><p>Amit Gupta<br/>CEO &amp; Founder<br/>Ecosystm</p><p>There's no doubt that monopolies have helped shape the world as we know it. John D Rockefeller and Standard Oil, for example, were instrumental in industrialising the US by investing in infrastructure - something they could afford only because they were a monopoly. The same could be said of AT&amp;T and telecommunications. And now, Google and Facebook have created Internet monopolies in their respective fields, while developing first-rate new tech.</p><p>That said, the world doesn't like monopolies because they represent too much power in one place - a power that is, all too often, abused in the end. It's probably too soon to judge whether there's a case for breaking up these firms, but I have no doubt that strong regulation is called for.</p><p>Alban Villani<br/>Regional MD, SEA-Pacific<br/>Criteo</p><p>Diversity and innovation spring from competition. What we don't need is an Internet where each vertical is controlled by a single e-commerce, search or social media operator. We need an open Internet where all players are free of any conflicts of interest and are able to increase the digital ecosystem's scope and diversity. The open Internet currently commands only 30 per cent of digital ad spend despite capturing half of Internet users. The other half are on Big Tech platforms that control large volumes of data, used in closed markets as a guaranteed source of income. Criteo sees an opportunity to level the playing field by supporting the growth of independent operators and making data sharing available for all. The digital sector needs transparency, with a clear distinction between consumer services and the monetisation of these services on the other.</p><p>Melissa Ries<br/>General Manager, Asia Pacific and Japan<br/>TIBCO Software</p><p>With the new wave of technology and acceleration of startups across Asia, it is a big task for regulators to manage the rapid growth of such tech startups. Data is the new currency, and regulations and policies can take us only so far. We - as users of such technology - must play a role in ensuring our data is protected. This can prompt tech giants to rethink how they use our data. Transparency is key to this issue, because if we easily understand the terms and there is a consensus with the company, then it gives a fair chance for the user to make the right decision.</p><p>Toby Koh<br/>Group MD<br/>Ademco Security Group</p><p>Facebook with its incredible reach needs to be accountable to its users, shareholders, staff and the general public. As we have seen, the power of the Facebook engine to shape and influence opinion is downright frightening. I do not, however, believe in a forced breakup of the company. Every company will go through its cycles of ups and downs. Facebook will not maintain such dominance forever. In the interim period, governments will attempt to hold the Big Tech firms accountable. Laws and regulations have already been mooted and enacted. The real power of data and communications is just beginning and it is my belief that if not Facebook, it will be others. Ownership of data and the monetisation of data is an irreversible trend and may require regulation to police.</p><p>There needs to be concerted efforts and thought in every countries and society on how to keep this beast on a leash.</p><p>Sheena Chin<br/>Country Director<br/>VERITAS Storage Singapore</p><p>Putting costs aside, dismantling Big Tech giants would not address the underlying causes of dominance. For instance, a particular platform or app will gain popularity when there are more users, resulting in a network effect and economic moat that further fuel its growth. In today's digital economy, tech giants that have the right business models, innovation and technologies will be here to stay. To protect the interests of individuals and consumers, it is worthwhile for the governments across the world to put in place well-defined regulations that could be enforced to minimise the occurrence of data breaches or to counter misinformation.</p><p>Stephanie Boo<br/>Managing Director - Asia Pacific<br/>Menlo Security</p><p>Facebook is an immensely powerful platform that has been used for ill as well as good. Breaking it up would be an epochal business event with huge implications. What can be said is that like most websites, Facebook is vulnerable to Web-borne malware. All it takes is for the visitor to click on some contaminated content and a wide range of possible data breaches opens up. Given its reach, Facebook could be hugely influential in educating its users to have better awareness and to practise caution while surfing the Web and sharing information. Positive altruistic action like that would improve the company's image and hopefully reduce the calls for its breakup.</p><p>Maren Schweizer<br/>Director<br/>Schweizer World Pte Ltd</p><p>Challenges associated with a digitising economy are playing out on a global scale. The economic potential of global marketplaces, platforms, and communities will require a deeper level of international cooperation.</p><p>Therefore I believe regulators shall put their efforts in creating a global standardised policy comparable to eg automotive-related products ISO/TS 16949.</p><p>To get there, we require a clear agenda and the joint forces of a small number of countries, a good sense of avoiding complexity triggered by overregulation and a test-and-learn approach to keep up with the pace of innovation. The agenda must include protecting user data from misuse and prevent the spread of fake news, that is a potential threat to our democracies.</p><p>History has shown that caravans move on and digital businesses are fast camels, thus social media companies can easily move somewhere else.</p><p>I believe stricter application of existing legislation makes more sense than splitting up companies while working towards a midterm global solution.</p><p>Arvind Sethumadhavan<br/>Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, APAC<br/>Dentsu Aegis Network</p><p>Growing distrust around data usage and the influence held by tech giants point to the crisis of confidence that exists in the digital economy today. Our 2019 Digital Society Index reveals consumers are increasingly taking back control of their digital experience as important human and societal needs are failing to be met, despite the widely acknowledged benefits brought by digital technology. Regulation alone will not solve this issue; change must be led proactively to harness digital with human needs placed squarely at the centre. Our data lab in India recently launched DDLCoin built on Blockchain to drive greater transparency in digital marketing. Businesses have an opportunity to turn transparency around data usage into a source of brand differentiation and innovation.</p><p>Helen Ng<br/>Chief Executive Officer<br/>Lock+Store</p><p>Breaking up Big Tech companies is regressive. Instead, we should compel tech giants like Facebook to give back even more to the community and impose harsher penalties for its questionable tactics. Research has shown that Big Tech's anti-competitive behaviour has, in some instances, led to lower consumer prices. Through symbiotic relationships with startups, Big Tech has also accelerated disruption cycles. I support introducing a more stringent regulatory framework for Big Tech companies, but not breaking them up.</p><p>Henry Tan<br/>Group CEO<br/>Nexia TS Group</p><p>This debate on whether a big domineering organisation should be split up is not new. Many jurisdictions are currently also considering the case for the Big Four accounting firms. However, in the interest of the free economy, business giants should not be split up. There are existing anti-competition provisions in many jurisdictions and these should cover the concerns. Over-regulation will result in entities seeking to circumvent rules by trying to do different ownership structures.</p><p>Lim Soon Hock<br/>Managing Director<br/>PLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd</p><p>No company is above the law, no matter how big or small.</p><p>The allegations against Facebook, compromising security and civility for clicks, will not be resolved by breaking up the company. The software that has been abused for improper social gains and unethical or dishonourable political maneuvers and malfeasance must be changed. It is within the power, capabilities and capacity of Facebook - irrespective of whether it exists as a single entity or several - to make.</p><p>While breaking up a company is intended to curtail monopoly, it is intended more to level the playing field for competition, and not to solve the abuse of the software and apps that Facebook offers and clearly dominates the market, for unethical, unauthorised and dishonorable objectives.</p><p>The law must be strongly enforced to stop Facebook from being abused to change culture, to influence elections or to empower nationalist leaders. Facebook must ensure it protects the privacy of users' personal data.</p><p>Kunalan Chakravarthy<br/>Chief Executive<br/>Priority Consultants</p><p>The question of splitting up Facebook or similar social communications platforms is a difficult one as these have become a fixture in our daily lives. Without such social media tools, how will parents keep in touch with their children, grandparents with their grandchildren, and other folks with friends and partners.</p><p>Over the years, the advances in technology have not only democratised the access to information but also enabled people to communicate regularly over long distances and different time zones. However, as with any good thing, somebody out there is always looking to exploit gullible, trusting people for nefarious and malicious reasons. How then do we eradicate the negative and only retain the positive? This is the utopian conundrum that governments around the world are attempting to address clumsily with a hatchet and a mallet.</p><p>Instead, much like Singapore's well renowned social education campaigns, it requires a multi-level, varied education programme to equip users with the knowledge and the nous to differentiate negative fake news from other benign information. Regulating Facebook or other social platforms is a hatchet approach that is sure to backfire and drive communications deeper underground - especially with the youth of today.</p><p>Sudhir Agarwal<br/>CEO<br/>Everise</p><p>With the advent of technological advancements in communication, we now communicate more efficiently online. Therefore, content moderation is an important tool for building brand recognition and trust with your audience, and companies today need to have the necessary processes in place to moderate content. As entrepreneurs continue to scale and grow their companies, it is inevitable that they will start to acquire companies along the way - similar to how we have grown. It is imperative for companies to carry out the due diligence and take into consideration the regulatory frameworks and customer data privacy policies with new market entries.</p><p>David Leong<br/>Managing Director<br/>PeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd</p><p>In 1911, the US Supreme Court ruled, in a landmark case, that a Big Oil company was an illegal monopoly and dismantled it into 34 smaller companies. Standard Oil Co Inc was an American oil producing, transporting, refining and marketing company and monopoly and was accused of using aggressive pricing to destroy competitors. Today's Big Tech giant, Facebook, is not very different.</p><p>When the monolithic giant threatens competition and has unfair advantages and access to audiences, as well as unchecked power, there must be oversight. With unfettered power that may supersede the government's, the giant must be dismantled. With full access to and control over individuals' privacy and information around communication trails, habits, buying and consumption patterns, music and video preferences, this private-sector ''Big Brother'' can rule the world. Governments are country-bound in power but Facebook is ubiquitous and global.</p><p>The Big Tech giants must certainly be regulated.</p><p>Zaheer K Merchant<br/>Regional Director (Singapore &amp; Europe)<br/>QI Group of Companies</p><p>In my mind, I am clear Facebook must be split up. Facebook fears little. Its control over messaging, communication, connectivity and data collection means it fears only regulatory control of the nature governments can impose; antitrust elements and accountability which they deny yet purport to mitigate. Even leaving aside the control and influence that Facebook wields or the proliferation of fake news or other acts propagated across all its platforms. It would be rational to break up Facebook since it has comprehensively hurt competition by buyouts and replication. Like how AT&amp;T was broken up by law in 1974, Facebook can be split into different entities with different services. Measures to avoid competition and cross sharing of services, servers or platforms can be implemented, along with proper guidelines, management and control. Measured oversight and regulation will make for far better and safer tech development in today's world.</p><p>Leonard Cheong<br/>Managing Director<br/>AdNovum Singapore</p><p>Breaking up the Big Tech giants will have an immediate impact on many integrated online offerings that consumers are dependent on. This can be seen in how demand for their products has remained strong, despite the unhappiness with the Big Tech giants - this has contributed to the achievements and behavior of these tech companies today. Rather than break them up, governments and lawmakers around the world need to come together to bone up on how these tech giants operate and behave, in the spirit of:</p><p>- preventing monopoly;</p><p>- promoting fair competition and innovation;</p><p>- protecting consumers and citizens;</p><p>- ensuring trust in the digital world.</p><p>Annie Yap<br/>CEO<br/>AYP HR Group</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook have responded that breaking up the company isn't going to help and that it's only by passing new rules for the Internet can the problems be solved. I agree with their stand.</p><p>Splitting up any of the Big Tech giants will not make posted content any more gracious or accountable. It's the users who need to be educated because their actions have a big impact on how the Internet is being perceived.</p><p>Governments need to make the first move to review and enforce stricter regulation on the Big Tech giants while they continue to identify and stop the spread of fake, racist and other harmful content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-249051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W4Y-KHS1-JCF2-8008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 20, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'll go in with a loose idea of what I need-tissues, maybe some almond milk-and wander around aimlessly, letting my eyes glaze over in front of shelves stocked abundantly with colorfully packaged goods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why Safeway has become my odd form of therapy, I don't know. Maybe, like a small bird, I get distracted by flashy packaging and bright signs.</p><p>Or maybe having an entire aisle of potato chips to choose from convinces me that I have some semblance of control over my otherwise tumultuous life as a college student.</p><p>But isn't that what contemporary capitalism is all about? Choice facilitates freedom, and American supermarkets are the embodiment of this sentiment.</p><p>As a well-circulated report by Oxfam International illustrates, this choice is illusory: the hundreds of brands we see in the grocery store are owned by 10 super-companies.</p><p>You may think you're choosing between 50 brands of cereal, but you're really choosing between General Mills or Kellogg's.</p><p>The same trend can be observed with big tech companies, but on a far larger scale. Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp combined have three billion users, and they're all owned by Facebook. Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Facebook are both worth over half a trillion dollars. According to eMarketer, those two companies combined shared 56 percent of digital ad revenue globally in 2018.</p><p>We must recognize the unique power big tech has over our society. When so much of our understanding of media, politics and the world is shaped by what these few companies feed us, there exists a threat to democracy.</p><p>We know that, in a free market, companies will behave rationally by doing whatever they can to increase profits. That's why we have government regulation. Take the Food and Drug Administration for example.</p><p>If left to their own devices, pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies may be tempted to take shortcuts in production, leading to an increase in profits, but leaving customers vulnerable to unsafe medical products. This is where the FDA comes in: they ensure pharmaceutical companies are doing what's best for the health of the nation.</p><p>Similarly, leaving platforms like Facebook and YouTube to regulate themselves comes at a cost.</p><p>To increase their profits, these sites have developed complex algorithms that push clickable content to the top of our newsfeeds. In doing so, they create filter bubbles, catering information directly to each user depending on their search history.</p><p>Author Eli Pariser coined this concept in his book \"The Filter Bubble,\" arguing that the representations these algorithms build of us can \"be even more discriminatory than people would be,\" narrowing our views and discouraging what is so precious to democracy: diversity of thought. In a world where the internet is the first place we look for information, filter bubbles are shaping our understanding of society in a dangerous way.</p><p>Social media platforms have also been weaponized by propagandists in the proliferation and spread of fake news. Because they are userinitiated platforms and not technically media organizations, they've been able to maintain the misinformation on their sites without being held responsible.</p><p>And why wouldn't they want to? Clickbait titles and outrageous headlines get more shares, generating more ad revenue. But the harm to democracy is dire, as we saw with the 2016 election. While it may not be their intention, Facebook and YouTube's algorithms have been shown time and time again to actively promote divisive, conspiratorial content.</p><p>Standing in the potato chip aisle at Safeway, I think the world of partially hydrogenated oils is my oyster-what an abundance of choice I have! Not so, and not so online, either.</p><p>What these algorithms show us is that while we think we have control over the information we see-or even actively search for-a handful of companies use the same algorithms that create filter bubbles and promote misinformation, limiting the diversity of ideas we interact with.</p><p>If the FDA can regulate food and pharmaceutical companies in the name of public health, why shouldn't we regulate algorithms for the health of democracy?</p><p>As long as these companies regulate themselves, we will continue to confront issues of fake news, dangerous rhetoric and privacy violations. Part of the issue is technological illiteracy: during both Congressional hearings with Facebook and Google CEOs about privacy violations, representatives asked uninformed, unproductive questions.</p><p>What we need is an entirely new government agency to protect Americans and regulate these supergiants-one in which experts on data and technology can work productively with companies like Facebook and Google to create unbiased algorithms and protect us from privacy violations.</p><p>It's time we recognize where antitrust laws fall short in the digital context and realize the unique power big tech has over our economy, democracy and society.</p><p>Carolyn Kuimelis is a first-year economics major.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4184688</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5G-3151-DY7P-T4HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Santa Clara: Santa Clara University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 21, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001UD4</classCode><className>KELLOGG CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001S0I</classCode><className>GENERAL MILLS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>OXFAM INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Digital media and big technology companies are now threatening the very existence of media organisations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Journalism has been affected, and the media industry the world over is reinventing and restructuring its strategy, while erecting new legal frameworks to protect itself. News organisations are formulating policies to work together and ensure that the freedom of Press is not compromised and credibility of news is protected. Yet, we, in the Arab world, are stuck in the past.</p><p>I have highlighted the state of media in previous articles and listed measures that can be taken to ensure the financial viability of the sector. However, it requires media outlets to join hands and collaborate with journalist associations to come up with solutions. Government support is also vital for the media to thrive in the digital age, and make profits. We need a level playing field and regulation of Internet companies and Big Tech.</p><p>At present, there is a gap in communication between departments of media institutions - which is primarily why they have not been able to keep pace with the changing demand in news and the ad market.</p><p>Arab media does not have any regulations and restrictions in place to protect its intellectual property. This could lead to blatant infringements by websites and search engines with respect to content. Issues regarding the use of names of media outlets across social networking sites have often been raised. Content from newspapers is freely shared on websites without due credit. It's called curation, and this is damaging the news process.</p><p>Those with an interest in media can easily spot the infringements by different media companies. Many resort to republishing articles of columnists commissioned by other newspapers on their social media platforms and websites without paying for publishing rights.</p><p>Those companies piggyback on other companies and lay their claims to fame without spending a penny. This should not be allowed in the Arab media or any other media for that matter. A fee for the content posted on social media websites and search engines should solve the problem. The changing virtual landscape and usage of content online has necessitated action by the Press syndicates to take a strong stand to protect newspapers. Some efforts have been successful, especially in countries that have levied a tax on search engines and social media platforms. This is then pumped back into the local Press.</p><p>A case in point is the media organisations of Europe demanding a legal framework to regulate content online. Meanwhile, intellectual property rights have suffered immensely in our region because of the posting of original content on social media for free. Once media companies put it put there, it is open for curation. Experts, too, have failed to flag such issues in conferences or shown any inclination to address them.</p><p>So, how can we protect our rights from the giant technology companies who are also into media? Some may consider claiming rights a kind of overstatement. But the fact is we need to wake up, we need to start thinking, we need to bring the issue to the talking table. I think it is time we draw up an organisational framework that can protect media organisations. We must move towards a sophisticated system to safeguard IP rights of the media in the region before it's too late. If not, we won't know the difference between Big Tech and the free Press.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:-malzarooni@khaleejtimes.com\">-malzarooni@khaleejtimes.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-127839898</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TFC-MK91-JDJN-652M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

Not to mention that such a task would be extraordinarily complex, and similar attempts to unravel giant companies have rarely succeeded in actually breaking them apart.</p><p>Rather than trying to split up these Big Tech companies, let's establish and enforce rules for these Internet platforms so that one company's products and services are not unfairly favored or prioritized over another. The sheer volume of our data that has been collected by Amazon, Google, and Facebook enables these companies to understand us in ways most of us never imagined when we signed up for their services. That data is used to increase the intelligence of their platforms on which they can prioritize their own products and services at the expense of competitors, and this creates an unfair playing field.</p><p>Does this remind you of the net neutrality debate? It should. Many of these same Big Tech companies Warren is calling out supported regulations so that a few telecom companies, such as AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Comcast, would not unfairly control access to the communications grid the Internet runs on.</p><p>The Internet Association, a trade group representing Amazon, Facebook, Google, and others argued to the Federal Communications Commission that they would be at a disadvantage if they had to negotiate with the telecom companies that controlled the grid to reach the same customers the telecom providers were selling similar services to. It was easy back then for Big Tech to imagine a world where a large telecom provider like Comcast would stream its movies at a faster speed than movies from a smaller competitor like Netflix.</p><p>Big Tech's control of data is analogous to the telecom giant's control of the communications grid. Think about how much involvement Amazon has on your life now. Yesterday, you might have shopped at Whole Foods for groceries, ordered new Nikes on your laptop, watched The Avengers on your TV, asked Alexa to play Bruno Mars, and, while scanning the latest headlines on your phone, saw unsolicited advertisements for running gear to go with the sneakers you just bought.</p><p>One company, Amazon, enabled you to shop, get personalized ads, be entertained, and receive products at home and on your tablet \u2014 and that company gathered massive amounts of data about you along the way. For consumers this means any perception of the Internet as an open and fair landscape, in which we all have the same maps and the same ability to wander the paths in a way that is best for us, is misguided. Amazon, Google, and Facebook have tuned vast portions of the Internet landscape to each user based on the data they have collected on us, and to the benefit of their own products and services. While this adds convenience to our lives today, such pervasive control will ultimately limit our freedom and choices.</p><p>Antitrust specialist Lina Khan gets it right in her 2017 paper \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,\" published in the Yale Law Journal: \"Allowing firms to amass market power makes it more difficult to meaningfully check that power when it is eventually exercised.\"</p><p>We agree that it is important to check that power, but breaking them apart will have consequences. These Big Tech companies are the seeding ground for many big ideas, anchors of large ecosystems of companies that employ millions of Americans, and vanguards of our country's technological leadership. We want these benefits, but we don't want this to stifle competitors or limit the freedom and choices of the consumer.</p><p>Rules that prevent Big Tech from using the outsized amounts of data they have collected on us, their version of the telecom giants' outsized control of the communications grid, to unfairly advantage their own products and services would be a good place to start \u2014 and it's an approach that has succeeded with other giants such as Microsoft and IBM in the past without breaking them up.</p><p>Warren is right that something needs to be done. While we believe Warren's primary mechanism of undoing prior acquisitions is impractical, we do support her thesis that outsized control of resources leads to unfair and anti-competitive situations, and regulations are necessary.</p><p>Mohamad Ali is the CEO of Carbonite, and Mike Baker is the CEO of dataxu.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-e818e598-5018-11e9-8ab3-ce0179ba21b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSX-HHK1-JC2G-C48P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 31, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Last year, a new law was expected to be in place by early 2020, after consultations among lawmakers. Covid set that schedule back. But Parliament has re-convened, and the very platforms under public scrutiny appear abuzz with a pressing need for checks and balances. The case for intervention cannot be overstated. Over the weekend, waves were made online by a Netflix documentary, The Social Dilemma, which portrays the perils posed by possibly addictive and uber-influential apps that keep us in touch. Among others, it cites Soshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, which raised an alarm in 2018 over \"persuasive tech\". Several Big Tech insiders have since flagged the risk of a dystopia that features a \"futures market\" for forecasts of user emotions and actions. No matter how overdone such worries may be, these platforms surely need regulation. The threat that hate speech poses our social cohesion is reason enough. We need a law that assures us all our rights to privacy and free speech, though with safety curbs placed by our Constitution on incendiary stuff. There is a rationale for a ban on yelling \"fire\" in a closed hall, and a version of it applies to various online settings as well.</p><p>On user privacy, those who ticked away their consent without reading an app's usage terms may not have a legal right to feel ripped off, but reports on the abuse of personal data have stirred valid outrage. Misuse simply has to be stopped. Under consideration, it appears, is a rule that would have apps ask for the explicit go-ahead of users before sharing their data-even if anonymized for a bulk study-with specified third parties for purposes stated upfront. This is good, but does not go far enough. As a basic principle, all ownership of such data must rest with the users who generate it-as a self-evident truth. In other words, a user should be able to bar even the app's owner from access to it. If that means users must finally pay for the use of a platform, then this option should exist. Apps, though, should be allowed to reward people for parting with their data, so long as verifiable disclosures are made on its use. Also, a public data authority should need at least a judicial warrant to trace messages, pry open private chats, etc; and the security exigencies that may justify such an intrusion should be spelt out.</p><p>On content moderation, the sovereign norms that we frame for social media should not fall victim to arbitrary interpretation-be it by a private or public agent-of what is okay and what is not. Regardless of avowals by platforms on the integrity of their own processes, we should lay down the red lines on free speech and hold them accountable for violations. We already have a democratic basis for restraints. Broadly, free speech is fine, but not if it is inflammatory or tramples the rights of others in other ways. Multi-media messages may need special guidelines. Clarity on these would be crucial. With highly polarized views within the country on what is fake and what is dangerous, we cannot afford ambiguity. Legislative action should ideally be the outcome of a public debate aimed at forging a national consensus on harmful content. And, yes, we need a light touch.

(AP Photo/Steven Senne)[3]   In the past week, Silicon Valley has faced renewed calls for greater regulation of social media platforms[4] amid the growing scandal of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election[5]. Given rising awareness of the serious problems inherent within U.S. internet giants' business models, it's an opportune time to discuss how best to regulate these companies. </p><p>I'm a researcher who studies regulation on the internet[6]. For my book, Chokepoints: Global Private Regulation on the Internet[7], I've interviewed representatives from internet firms and their trade associations, along with policymakers in Canada and the U.S. in regards to what responsibility intermediaries should have for content on their platforms. Internet intermediaries typically frame their opposition to legislation as protecting freedom of expression, but no right of speech is absolute. This debate is a battle over the control over information[8]: What data should be collected and sold, what content should be permitted online, and who should decide? Last week the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee[9] grilled senior legal counsel for Facebook, Google and Twitter about their roles in Russian efforts to influence the U.S. election. <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/193489/original/file-20171106-1020-yam48g.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/193489/original/file-20171106-1020-yam48g.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>   From left: Facebook's general counsel Colin Stretch, Twitter's acting general counsel Sean Edgett and Google's senior vice-president and general counsel Kent Walker are sworn in for a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russian election activity and technology on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 1. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)[10]  In a startling development, after months of denying and downplaying their responsibility, executives from each of the three companies grudgingly admitted[11] that they had not yet determined the full extent of Russian activities on their platforms. The executives' testimony starkly reveals that the companies have few controls on the advertisements[12] and so-called 'fake news'[13] that they accept on their platforms. These candid admissions from the social media giants focus much-needed attention on the serious problems inherent with big intermediaries' data-intensive business models. Few safeguards, financial interest in status quo As the U.S. election scandal shows, big social media platforms not only have few safeguards to prevent the deliberate manipulation of information[14], but they also have financial interests in maintaining the status quo. Unfettered flows of information and unconstrained advertising revenue are key to their business models. And this model is tremendously profitable. Facebook's[15] third-quarter profit was an astounding US$4.7 billion, the vast majority coming from advertisements relating to its 1.3 billion average daily users. Viral stories, whether factual or false, attract clicks and advertising revenue. Given the seemingly intractable challenges of regulating social media platforms, what can be done? In the United States, three members of Congress have proposed a bipartisan response, the Honest Ads Act[16], that would require platforms to publish information about their advertisers and maintain a public archive of political advertisements[17].       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/193490/original/file-20171106-1014-1wwrwe8.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/193490/original/file-20171106-1014-1wwrwe8.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>  U.S. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal discusses an online ad falsely depicting actor and comedian Aziz Ansari urging people to vote in the 2016 election by posting to Twitter at a Senate judiciary subcommittee hearing on crime and terrorism on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 31. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)[18]  This is a step in the right direction, and the Canadian government should consider similar measures in advance of the 2019 federal election. Facebook has already announced a program, the Canadian Election Integrity Initiative[19], to counter the spread of misinformation that focuses on media literacy and training. Deliberate misinformation While these projects appear useful, they likely will do little to address the underlying problem: The bad-faith spread of online misinformation. That's because the fundamental problem lies with Facebook's business model. Efforts to constrain the flow of information, especially information that generates advertising revenue, are contrary to their business model. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who initially dismissed claims of Russian interference as 'crazy[20]' just after the 2016 U.S. election, said on Nov. 1 that Facebook's new security features to counter so-called fake news[21] will have a 'significant impact our profitability[22].' While the big platforms can afford to take a financial hit to restore their reputations and work to get rid of the worst offenders, they can't fully solve the problem without fundamentally changing how \u2014 and with whom \u2014 they do business.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/193491/original/file-20171106-1017-774va4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/193491/original/file-20171106-1017-774va4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>Facebook ads linked to a Russian effort to stir tensions on divisive social issues during the U.S. election campaign. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)[23]  In response to what has become a fundamental challenge to the survival of liberal democracy, Facebook, Twitter and Google have all committed to voluntarily implementing measures to address the spread of misinformation and targeting accounts that troll other users with often bigoted, racist content. Google[24], for example, is creating a public database of election advertising content that appears on its services. These companies prefer self-regulation to legislation and they've lobbied[25] the U.S Federal Election Commission in the past to have online political advertising exempt from disclosure. It's only the political pressure from the Senate inquiry that is forcing these platforms into action. Internet companies, algorithms are black boxes While these developments may seem like attempts by these major companies to be responsible, they amount to Google et al saying: 'Trust us to fix the problem we created.[26]' However, while Google, Facebook and Twitter are all creating algorithms to, in the words of Zuckerberg[27], 'detect bad content and bad actors,' these algorithms operate as so-called 'black boxes[28].' This means that the criteria the algorithms use to make decisions are off-limits to public scrutiny.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/193492/original/file-20171106-1046-1phkae4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip\">https://images.theconversation.com/files/193492/original/file-20171106-1046-1phkae4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0...5...o=format...000...=clip</url>Facebook and Instagram ads tied to a Russian bid to influence the 2016 U.S. election, released by the U.S. House Intelligence committee in Washington, D.C., Nov. 1. (AP Photo/Jon Elswick)[29]  Is 'trust us' a good enough response, given the problem? With so much at stake, it may be time for a fundamental rethink of how these indispensable 21st century companies are regulated and what they're allowed to do. At the very minimum, governments and citizens should reconsider whether the lack of oversight into how these companies shape our speech rights is really in the public interest. Social media platforms 'are an enabler of democracy,' says Margrethe Vestager[30], the European Union's Commissioner for Competition, but we're seeing that 'they can also be used against our very basic beliefs in democracy.' It's time to start taking that threat to democracy seriously.

As well, the Liberals promised new regulations to better protect personal data and the creation of a \"data commissioner\" role to oversee the process.</p><p>This sort of reform is overdue. During its first term, the Trudeau government had an almost laissez faire attitude toward the idea of regulating big data, probably due to its reluctance to face off with these major global corporations.</p><p>But things have changed. Successive scandals, data breeches and consumer exploitation have shaken the faith of many Canadians. They don't trust Google and Facebook the way they used to, so are more likely to be supportive of regulatory reform. Whatever the rationale, it's good news provided the new government keeps its commitment to finally move on this subject.</p><p>New taxes are not to be taken lightly.</p><p>But in some arenas, they are entirely appropriate, and this is one of those cases. The plan would see multinational tech giants taxed on three per cent of the revenue they generate in Canada, from the sales of online advertising or other profits related to Canadian user data. And why not?</p><p>Canadian companies already pay taxes, so why shouldn't multinationals? They're cashing in on Canadian consumer data, which they would otherwise not have.

During its first term, the Trudeau government had an almost laissez faire attitude toward the idea of regulating big data, probably due to its reluctance to face off with these major global corporations.</p><p>But things have changed. Successive scandals, data breeches and consumer exploitation have shaken the faith of many Canadians. They don't trust Google and Facebook the way they used to, so are more likely to be supportive of regulatory reform. Whatever the rationale, it's good news provided the new government keeps its commitment to finally move on this subject.</p><p>New taxes are not to be taken lightly.</p><p>But in some arenas, they are entirely appropriate, and this is one of those cases. The plan would see multinational tech giants taxed on three per cent of the revenue they generate in Canada, from the sales of online advertising or other profits related to Canadian user data. And why not?</p><p>Canadian companies already pay taxes, so why shouldn't multinationals? They're cashing in on Canadian consumer data, which they would otherwise not have. So it makes perfect sense that they pay corporate taxes in countries where they generate revenue.</p><p>Two things: First, this will only apply to companies with at least $1 billion in global revenue per year, with Canadian revenues of at least $40 million annually. This isn't an attempt to capture small fish.</p><p>Second, this is a stopgap measure. A permanent solution requires international consensus on how best to regulate and tax companies operating on the international stage, where physical borders mean little or nothing.</p><p>But that consensus is not surprisingly a challenge, and in the meantime there is no reason for countries like ours to stand by while global digital giants siphon off valuable data and profit while paying nothing back.</p><p>There is good reason to think this can move swiftly and constructively through Parliament. The Liberals no longer command a majority so will need help, but there should be no shortage with all the other progressive parties - Bloc, Greens and NDP - having expressed similar views and even the Conservatives appearing supportive toward a level playing field.</p><p>That doesn't mean it will be easy. These overdue measures will ruffle international feathers, particularly American ones.</p><p>The U.S., especially with a bombastic hothead at the helm, will probably object since most of the companies in question are U.S.-based. No doubt the Trump administration will see taxes and regulations as tariffs on American business, and no doubt sabres will rattle.</p><p>But consider this - what if the situation was reversed?

The clamor from U.S. regulators has gotten louder recently, with calls for investigations into big tech's antitrust activities, as well as the implications of their data gathering on privacy and the democratic process.</p><p>The calls for stepped up regulations on big tech come at a time of increasing clout for their platforms, whose oversight doesn't fall neatly under existing U.S. laws. Wharton experts find these new business models also necessitate a reassessment of antitrust law.</p><p>In this, the U.S. seems to be following Europe. Google is appealing its latest fine of $1.7 billion by European regulators for alleged anticompetitive practices in the online advertising market.</p><p>The case against Google is \"very strong,\" says Eric K. Clemons, Wharton professor of operations, information and decisions, noting that the European Union was penalizing what it saw as an abuse of platform power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123012170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCH-S031-JCBF-S126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"194\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 14, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
