In an op-ed for the New York Times[1], the former CEO of Google argued that Americans had put 'too much faith in the private sector' to drive technological advances \u2014 giving China the chance to catch up. Schmidt said his time as chairman of both the National Security Commission on AI and the Defense Innovation Board had shown him how this would have 'profound ramifications for our economy and defense.'What Schmidt wantsAlthough research suggests[2]that the US currently leads the world in AI, China is on course to overtake it within the next 10 years \u2014around the same time that the communist nation isprojected to become the world's biggest economy[3]. Schmidt urged the US government to reverse this trend by creating a strategy that firstestablishes national priorities across emerging technologies, with a special focus on those areas that can bolster defense and security. </p><p>He welcomed the White House's commitment to pour billions into AI and quantum R...]but said the government still needed to double that funding. He also called forCongress to meet President Trump's request for a huge increase in defense R...unding, which the Pentagon could use to build new military capabilities. [Read:Pentagon unveils toothless ethical principles for using AI in war[5]] Schmidt also wants to incentivize the emergence of an American competitor to Huawei, more partnerships between government and industry, new ways to fund research, better training of scientists and engineers, and more global tech experts to come to the US. Finally, Schmidt wantsthe government to take the lead on regulating tech \u2014 particularly AI. His comments reflect a growing belief that Silicon Valley has for too long been left to its own devices. Whether the White House answers his call may depend on who sits in it come November.You're here because you want to learn more about artificial intelligence. So do we.

It said today it had looked at additional measures such as medical staff on its booth and temperature checks, but still could not guarantee safety.</p><p>The London event did allow us to take the temperature of 5G progress though, with the company\u00a0eager to get its message out that, despite all the Huawei hoo-ha, it is Ericsson that has global leadership in next-generation networks.</p><p>\u201cWe've deployed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/5g\"> 24 [live] networks</url> across the world [in 14 countries].

Analysts see Europe holding\u00a0back on 5G investment because of Huawei\u00a0security concerns and US pressure,\u00a0but Mr Jejdling said the main constraints on its growth remained availability of spectrum, deployment costs\u00a0and the number of consumer devices.

UK competition authorities have approved Google's $2.6bn acquisition of Looker Data Sciences, just as the company opened its\u00a0appeal in Luxembourg against a \u20ac2.4bn fine\u00a0for anti-competitively promoting its shopping search engine.

AI is an important theme this year and consumers see it playing a much more prominent role than before - both in society and at work. In fact, 35 percent of advanced internet users want an AI advisor at work, and one in four would like an AI as their manager. These are the 10 trends for 2017 and beyond: 1. AI Everywhere: 35 percent of advanced internet users want an AI advisor at work, and one in four would like an AI as their manager. </p><p>At the same time, almost half are concerned that AI robots will soon make a lot of people lose their jobs. 2. Setting the Pace for Internet of Things: Consumers are increasingly using automated applications, encouraging IoT adoption. Two in five believe smartphones will learn their habits and perform activities on their behalf automatically. 3. Pedestrians Drive Autonomous Cars: Car drivers may not exist in the future. One in four pedestrians would feel safer crossing a street if all cars were autonomous, and 65 percent of them would prefer to have an autonomous car. 4. Merged Reality: Almost four out of five virtual reality users believe VR will be indistinguishable from reality in only three years. Half of respondents are already interested in gloves or shoes that allow you to interact with virtual objects. 5. Bodies Out of Sync: As autonomous cars become reality, car sickness issues will increase, and three in ten foresee needing sickness pills. One in three also want motion sickness pills for use with virtual and augmented reality technology. 6. The Smart Device Safety Paradox: More than half already use emergency alarms, tracking or notifications on their smartphones. Of those who say their smartphone makes them feel safer, three in five say they take more risks because they rely on their phone. 7. Social Silos: Today, people willingly turn their social networks into silos. One in three says social networks are their main source of news. And more than one in four value their contacts' opinions more than politicians' viewpoints. 8. Augmented Personal Reality: Over half of people would like to use augmented reality glasses to illuminate dark surroundings and highlight dangers. More than one in three would also like to edit out disturbing elements around them. 9. The Privacy Divide: Two in five advanced internet users want to use only encrypted services, but people are divided. Almost half would like to have just reasonably good privacy across all services, and more than one out of three believes privacy no longer exists. 10. Big Tech for All: More than two out of five advanced internet users would like to get all their products from the biggest five IT companies. Of those, three in four believe this will happen only five years from now. Reflecting on the rise of virtual reality, Michael Bj\u00f6rn, Head of Research, Ericsson ConsumerLab, says: \"Beyond real time, I believe we should be talking about reality time. In fact, what we call reality becomes ever more personal and subjective. Consumers not only surround themselves with the like-minded on social networks, but also are also starting to customize the way they experience the world with augmented and virtual reality technologies. \"Consumers also want the future to remain fully mobile, implying that demand for battery-friendly, instant and fast connectivity is set to grow rapidly. In that sense, reality time means it is time for 5G networks.\" The insights in the 10 Hot Consumer Trends for 2017 report are based on Ericsson ConsumerLab's global research activities over more than 20 years, as well as data points from an online survey of advanced internet users in 14 major cities across the world, performed in October 2016. Although the study only represents 27 million citizens, their early adopter profile makes them important to understand when exploring future trends.

Something of a pity really for someone, let alone a journalist, of his richness in maturity should by now have realised that this is the damn point of it all[1]:</p><p><br/><br/>The real lesson of the Uber expos\u00e9, though, is that it's time to discard the rose-tinted spectacles with which we have hitherto viewed these Silicon Valley outfits. For too long, they have been allowed to trade fraudulently on the afterglow of the hippie libertarianism that supposedly infected the early days of the personal computer industry. The billionaire geeks who currently run the giant internet companies may look and talk like a new species of entrepreneur but it would be more prudent to view them as John D Rockefellers in hoodies.<br/> And the economic philosophy that's embedded in this new digital capitalism is neoliberalism red in tooth and claw, which is why they minimise the number of 'ordinary' (ie non-geek) workers on their payrolls, outsource everything they can, despise trade unions, view regulators as barriers to 'innovation' and are outraged by the temerity of European institutions that seek to curb their freedoms of action.<br/><br/>Yes, exactly. Companies operate to the benefit of their shareholders. They're also pretty red in tooth and claw when they do so. And if that were all the economy were about then agreed, we consumers might not enjoy the experience all that much. Which is why we do our darndest to make sure that that's not all there is in the economy. The other magic ingredient we look for is competition. This means that we've any number of red in tooth and claw capitalist institutions trying to do the best for their owners and for their owners only. But they can only do this by offering us something that we think is worth it. Their proposition must offer us value: both in the simple sense that no one buys anything at all that they don't think is worth more than they are paying for it and also in the more detailed sense that competition means that the offering must be better than that of those others.<br/> It's competition in the market that tempers that profit lust. Just as it's competition that tempers the inherent inefficiencies and producer capture of formerly monopolistic and non-profit making state services.<br/> On that capitalist side of it this is the very point of the entire system. We want them to be sharp elbowed, nothing but profit seeking, neoliberals. Because only by producing something that we both desire and are willing to pay for can they become those billionaires (geeks or not).<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/23/uber-dig-dirt-big-tech-digital-capitalists\">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/23/uber-dig-dirt-big-tech-digital-capitalists</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-SMIT10022914168152973449329669</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMIT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DNT-K7R1-JCMN-Y2PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><timeReceived>7:48 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Pin Factory Blog</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 24, 2014 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>John Naughton</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Regulation Industry</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Silicon Valley</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

Ein Blick auf die gro\u00dfen Themen beim Weltwirtschaftsforum.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Das World Economic Forum wartet 2018 mit einer Rekordzahl von Toppolitikern auf: Stolze 70 Staats- und Regierungschefs tummeln sich dieses Jahr in den Graub\u00fcndner Alpen, um die gro\u00dfen globalen Probleme zu diskutieren. Und zum Start des Wirtschaftsgipfels am Dienstag geht es gleich hochkar\u00e4tig los: Kanadas Premierminister Justin Trudeau wird am Abend seine Agenda f\u00fcr den Vorsitz der G7-Staaten pr\u00e4sentieren, den das Land seit Anfang Januar innehat. Kanadas Plan f\u00fcr das B\u00fcndnis sieben westlicher Staaten hat viele Schnittmengen mit den Themen des Weltwirtschaftsgipfels: So will Trudeau die internationalen Krisen bek\u00e4mpfen, den Kampf gegen den Klimawandel verst\u00e4rken sowie mehr Gleichberechtigung zwischen M\u00e4nnern und Frauen und ein stabiles Sicherheitsger\u00fcst f\u00fcr die Welt schaffen. Dazu hat er im Juni zum G7-Gipfel der Staats- und Regierungschefs in die kanadische Provinz Quebec geladen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Doch zun\u00e4chst einmal werden die Staatschefs die Schweizer Berge zu ihrer Weltb\u00fchne machen. Und es k\u00f6nnte gut sein, dass die am Dienstag von Trudeau vorgestellte Agenda schon wenige Tage sp\u00e4ter durch wuchtige \"America first\"-Parolen des US-Pr\u00e4sidenten Donald Trump in St\u00fccke gerissen wird. Trump wird kurz vor Abschluss der Konferenz am Freitagnachmittag reden und d\u00fcrfte schon im Vorfeld die Gespr\u00e4che auf den Fluren des Davoser Kongresszentrums dominieren.</p><p>Ebenfalls viel beachtet d\u00fcrfte die Er\u00f6ffnungsrede des indischen Premiers Narendra Modi sein. Ein Jahr nach dem fulminanten Auftritt von Chinas Staatspr\u00e4sident Xi Jinping, bei dem er sich auf dem Davoser Parkett als Verteidiger des Freihandels inszenierte, d\u00fcrfte Modi vor allem daran erinnern, dass auch Indien einen Platz als aufstrebende globale Wirtschaftsmacht beansprucht.</p><p>Aber auch China wird am Er\u00f6ffnungstag wieder ein viel diskutiertes Thema sein, und das obwohl in diesem Jahr deutlich weniger politische Prominenz aus der zweitgr\u00f6\u00dften Wirtschaftsnation der Welt anwesend ist. Schon seit einiger Zeit mehren sich Sorgen \u00fcber die rapide gestiegene Verschuldung des Landes und ein m\u00f6gliches Platzen der Immobilienblase. In der Debatte \u00fcber hei\u00df gelaufene M\u00e4rkte und die Risiken einer neuen Finanzkrise wird daher Fang Xinghai, Vizechef der wichtigen Finanzaufsicht China Securities Regulatory Commission, ein gefragter Gespr\u00e4chspartner sein.</p><p>Der Dienstagnachmittag steht ganz im Zeichen der Umbr\u00fcche durch die digitale Revolution. So werden der Chef des Taxisdienstes Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, und Ruth Porat, im Google-Vorstand f\u00fcr Finanzen verantwortlich, diskutieren, wie mehr Vertrauen f\u00fcr neue Technologien geschaffen werden kann. Der autonome Verkehr, der Siegeszug der Algorithmen und die sozialen Folgen der Digitalisierung werden ebenfalls thematisiert.</p><p>Eine zentrale Rolle werden der Kampf gegen Geschlechterungleichheit und die MeToo-Debatte einnehmen. Davos hat den Ruf als ein Treffen wei\u00dfer M\u00e4nner. Dagegen wurde nun ein Zeichen gesetzt: Alle sieben Co-Vorsitzende des Gipfels sind Frauen - darunter die Chefin des Internationalen W\u00e4hrungsfonds, Christine Lagarde, sowie die IBM-Chefin Ginni Rometty. Am Dienstag pr\u00e4sentieren sie ihre Vision f\u00fcr eine gemeinsame Zukunft der Nationen.</p><p>Zweiter Tag: 24. Januar Vorhang auf f\u00fcr die gro\u00dfe Politik .</p><p>Am zweiten Tag des Forums dreht sich vieles um die gro\u00dfen politischen Themen - von den italienischen Wahlen \u00fcber die Reform der Euro-Zone bis hin zur schwelenden Krise im Nahen Osten. Bevor man sich diesen m\u00e4chtigen Fragen widmet, kann man den Tag zun\u00e4chst mit einer Diskussionsrunde \u00fcber die immer weiter um sich greifende Selfie-Kultur beginnen.</p><p>Derart inspiriert, ist man vermutlich bereit f\u00fcr die politischen Fragen dieser Zeit. Dazu geh\u00f6rt nat\u00fcrlich auch die Zukunft der Euro-Zone und die der Europ\u00e4ischen Union insgesamt. Dieses Thema d\u00fcrfte vor allem der franz\u00f6sische Staatspr\u00e4sident Emmanuel Macron zu besetzen wissen. Er hatte seine Vision f\u00fcr eine umfassende Reform und tiefere Integration Europas in der Woche nach der deutschen Bundestagswahl im vergangenen Herbst vorgestellt. In Davos d\u00fcrfte er seine Ideen hierzu bekr\u00e4ftigen und zugleich f\u00fcr seine Reformagenda f\u00fcr sein Heimatland Frankreich werben.</p><p>Nach einer ebensolchen Agenda d\u00fcrfte auch der italienische Ministerpr\u00e4sident Paolo Gentiloni vielfach gefragt werden. Denn der politische Umbau Italiens kommt nicht voran, und angesichts eines Umfragepatts zwischen den rivalisierenden Parteienb\u00fcndnissen schwindet die Hoffnung auf einen Reformschub nach der Wahl Anfang M\u00e4rz. Immerhin haben sich zuletzt die Sorgen etwas verfl\u00fcchtigt, dass eine neue italienische Regierung auf einer antieurop\u00e4ischen Welle schwimmen k\u00f6nnte.</p><p>Auch am Abend wird sich alles um Europa drehen: Bei einem Dinner im Hotel Meierhof versuchen sich die deutsche Verteidigungsministerin Ursula von der Leyen sowie der franz\u00f6sische und der spanische Wirtschaftsminister, Bruno Le Maire und Luis de Guindos, an einem gemeinsamen Konzept zur \"Erneuerung Europas\". Von der Leyen wird sich etwas fr\u00fcher am Tag auch der Zukunft des Nahen Ostens widmen, in einer Panelrunde mit Au\u00dfenministern aus drei arabischen Staaten sowie dem stellvertretenden t\u00fcrkischen Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten Mehmet Simsek.</p><p>Wem das alles zu viel Politik ist, f\u00fcr den bietet der zweite Tag auch eine Menge prominenter Wirtschaftsthemen. Eines der Highlights ist ein Interview des WEF-Gr\u00fcnders Klaus Schwab mit dem Google-Vorstandschef Sundar Pichai, in dem vor allem \u00fcber k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz gesprochen wird. Doch auch eine Podiumsdiskussion \u00fcber die digitale Revolution in der Gesundheitsbranche mit Microsoft-Chef Satya Nadella d\u00fcrfte f\u00fcr viel Aufmerksamkeit sorgen. Das gleiche gilt f\u00fcr ein Gespr\u00e4ch zwischen Carlyle-Chef David Rubenstein und dem Gr\u00fcnder des chinesischen Amazon-Rivalen JD.com, Richard Liu.</p><p>Die Medien bieten ebenfalls Gespr\u00e4chsstoff: Wikipedia-Gr\u00fcnder Jimmy Wales wird \u00fcber Fake News sprechen. Die weltweite Diskussion \u00fcber solche Fehlinformationen hat auch dazu beigetragen, dass das Vertrauen in Medien laut einer f\u00fcr Davos erstellten Studie der PR-Agentur Edelman zuletzt drastisch gefallen ist. Daniel Sch\u00e4fer Dritter Tag: 25. Januar Brexit, Bitcoin und Big Tech .</p><p>Am Donnerstag erwartet die rund 3 000 Teilnehmer des Gipfels ein Potpourri an Zukunftsthemen: Vom Brexit \u00fcber den Klimawandel bis hin zum Datenschutz und dem Bitcoin-Hype. Ein politisches Highlight wird am fr\u00fchen Nachmittag der Auftritt der britischen Premierministerin Theresa May. Sie wird ihre Zuh\u00f6rer davon zu \u00fcberzeugen suchen, dass sie Gro\u00dfbritannien trotz der aufreibenden Verhandlungen und Debatten \u00fcber den Ausstieg aus der Europ\u00e4ischen Union nicht abschreiben sollten. Wie gut sie mit dieser Botschaft ankommen wird, bleibt abzuwarten. Schlie\u00dflich gilt die Konservative zu Hause als politisch schwer angeschlagen. Sie k\u00e4mpft mit einer instabilen Regierung, gro\u00dfen Zweifeln an ihrer Amtsf\u00fchrung und einer aufflammenden Debatte \u00fcber ein zweites Brexit-Referendum.</p><p>Ein \u00e4hnlich m\u00fchsamer Kampf wird auf globaler B\u00fchne um den Klimawandel ausgefochten. Bis zum Ende des Jahrhunderts d\u00fcrfte sich die Erde nach j\u00fcngsten Sch\u00e4tzungen um 3,2 Grad erw\u00e4rmen - mehr als doppelt so viel wie im Pariser Klimaabkommen vereinbart wurde. Am Donnerstag diskutieren unter anderem der ehemalige US-Vizepr\u00e4sident Al Gore und der Chef des Versicherungskonzerns Axa, Thomas Buberl, wie das doch noch verhindert werden kann. Einen Hoffnungsschimmer gibt es: Nachdem er erst angek\u00fcndigt hatte, die USA aus dem Pariser Klimaabkommen herauszuf\u00fchren, hat es US-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump k\u00fcrzlich als \"vorstellbar\" bezeichnet, doch wieder \"mitzumachen\".</p><p>Auch werden sich die versammelten Entscheider nochmals mit dem rasanten technologischen Fortschritt besch\u00e4ftigen. Welche gesellschaftlichen Folgen wird die digitale Revolution in den n\u00e4chsten zwei Dekaden haben? Dieser Frage stellen sich der Chef des Telekommunikationskonzerns Vodafone Vittorio Colao, der Boss des Bezahldienstes Paypal Dan Schulman, ABB-Vorstandschef Ulrich Spiesshofer sowie Ya-Qin Zhang, der Pr\u00e4sident des chinesischen Internetkonzerns Baidu. Und \u00fcber die Konsequenzen f\u00fcr den Datenschutz wird unter anderem Ginni Rometty, die Chefin des Computergiganten IBM sprechen.</p><p>Auch an der Finanzbranche gehen die globalen Umbr\u00fcche nicht vorbei - ganz im Gegenteil. Daher werden US-Finanzminister Steven Mnuchin, Deutsche-Bank-Aufsichtsratschef Paul Achleitner und Blackrock-Boss Larry Fink aufzeigen, wie die globale Finanzarchitektur der Zukunft aussehen k\u00f6nnte: Wird der Dollar seine dominante Stellung verlieren? Wie radikal wird die Digitalisierung die Finanzbranche ver\u00e4ndern? Und was bedeutet der Boom der Kryptow\u00e4hrungen?</p><p>Der Hype rund um Bitcoin ampersand Co. wird ein viel diskutiertes Thema auf den Fluren der Konferenzhallen sein. Und nicht nur da: Am Donnerstagabend diskutiert Yale-\u00d6konom Robert Shiller auf dem Podium, ob die Cyberm\u00fcnzen die n\u00e4chste Finanzkrise ausl\u00f6sen k\u00f6nnten.</p><p>Vierter Tag: 26. Januar Erwarte das Unerwartete! .</p><p>Traditionell geh\u00f6rt der letzte Tag des Weltwirtschaftsgipfels eigentlich den Propheten und Prognostikern: Beim \"Global Economic Outlook\" sagen bekannte Wirtschaftsauguren wie die Chefin des Internationalen W\u00e4hrungsfonds Christine Lagarde und der Bank-of-England-Gouverneur Mark Carney die wirtschaftliche Zukunft der Welt voraus. Das wird auch in diesem Jahr wieder der Fall sein. Doch diese Diskussion wird deutlich weniger beachtet werden als sonst. Der Grund daf\u00fcr tr\u00e4gt einen bekannten Namen: Donald Trump.</p><p>Der US-Pr\u00e4sident und bekennende Anti-Globalist hat sich f\u00fcr seinen gro\u00dfen Auftritt auf dem Klassentreffen der Globalisierungsfans den letzten Tag des Forums ausgesucht. Sein Schlussakkord des Gipfels wird in diesem Jahr alles \u00fcberschatten, was an den dreieinhalb Tagen davor gesagt, angek\u00fcndigt und debattiert wurde.</p><p>Ausgerechnet der Freihandelsgegner Trump ist der erste US-Pr\u00e4sident seit Bill Clinton, der an dem Treffen in den Schweizer Bergen teilnehmen wird. Und er wird in seiner Air Force One eine prominent besetzte Entourage mitbringen: Allein acht Kabinettsmitglieder machen sich mit auf die Reise. Dazu geh\u00f6ren Finanzminister Steven Mnuchin, Handelsminister Wilbur Ross und der Chef des nationalen Wirtschaftsrats und ehemalige Goldman-Sachs-Spitzenbanker Gary Cohn.</p><p>Davos wird dem 71 Jahre alten Pr\u00e4sidenten und ehemaligen Immobilienunternehmer die perfekte B\u00fchne bieten, um seine politische und \u00f6konomische \"America first\"-Agenda zu bekr\u00e4ftigen. Damit k\u00f6nnte er einen Gegenpol setzen zum Vorjahr, in dem sich der chinesische Staatspr\u00e4sident Xi Jinping als gl\u00fchender Verfechter des Freihandels pr\u00e4sentierte. Einen derartigen Rollentausch h\u00e4tte wohl noch vor ein paar Jahren keiner der Davos-Reisenden f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich gehalten. Doch so richtig kann niemand vorhersehen, welche Botschaft der heftig umstrittene US-Pr\u00e4sident in diesem Jahr von den Alpen in die Welt transportieren wird. Schlie\u00dflich war bei Donald Trump bislang immer nur eines sicher: dass er unberechenbar ist.</p><p>Unberechenbar ist auch der Ausgang des gigantischen geldpolitischen Experiments, welches die Notenbanken der westlichen Staaten w\u00e4hrend der Finanzkrise gestartet haben. Den Fragen, ob und wie die gro\u00dfe Geldflut der vergangenen Jahre wieder r\u00fcckg\u00e4ngig gemacht werden kann und welche \u00f6konomischen Folgen das haben wird, werden sich UBS-Verwaltungsratschef Axel Weber, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9 von der Europ\u00e4ischen Zentralbank und Hedgefonds-Titan Ray Dalio widmen. Und auch beim \"Global Economic Outlook\" wird dieses Thema nat\u00fcrlich eine zentrale Rolle spielen.</p><p>Wem nach so viel Programm und harter Ged\u00e4chtniskost der Kopf ordentlich dr\u00f6hnt, der kann sich zum Abschluss des Forums in der Kongresshalle zu den Kl\u00e4ngen des Davoser Kammerchors entspannen.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HANDLB-HB47CBE9759BC04C60971051B0206F1FAA</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HANDLB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RG5-H331-DXKF-C36B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401699</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Handelsblatt GmbH - ein Unternehmen der Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt GmbH &amp; Co.

Mit der US-Regierung hat der 44-j\u00e4hrige jedoch wenig zu tun - er ist der erste offizielle Tech-Botschafter der Welt. Seit rund zwei Jahren vertritt Klynge die politischen Interessen D\u00e4nemarks bei den gro\u00dfen Technologiefirmen - allen voran Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Google und Apple (FAMGA).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jedes dieser Unternehmen hat einen h\u00f6heren Jahresumsatz, als das Bruttoinlandsprodukt von L\u00e4ndern wie Kroatien, Bulgarien oder Kamerun betr\u00e4gt.</p><p>Ein \u00e4hnlicher Trend zeichnet sich f\u00fcr die gro\u00dfen Internetfirmen Chinas ab - die Suchmaschine Baidu, den Online-H\u00e4ndler Alibaba und den Techkonzern Tencent, der das gr\u00f6\u00dfte soziale Netzwerk und den gr\u00f6\u00dften Messenger Chinas betreibt. Hinzu kommt der Einfluss, den Plattformen wie Google und Facebook und ihre chinesischen Entsprechungen auf die \u00f6ffentliche Meinungsbildung aus\u00fcben. Kein Wunder also, dass Staaten nun beginnen, die Macht der Tech-Riesen ernstzunehmen.</p><p>\"Technologie hat einen riesigen Einfluss auf Individuen, Staaten und au\u00dfenpolitische Beziehungen\", erkl\u00e4rt Casper Klynge im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Business Insider. \"Mein Job ist der eines klassischen Diplomaten: Es geht vorrangig um den politischen Aspekt von Technologie, um Networking und Austausch mit den Firmen vor Ort.\"</p><p>Wie stellen wir sicher, dass Extremismus und Terrorismus nicht \u00fcber soziale Medien verbreitet werden? Wie k\u00f6nnen wir die Gesellschaft auf das autonome Fahren vorbereiten? Wie entwickeln und f\u00f6rdern wir Cybersecurity und das Internet der Dinge weiter? Mit solchen Fragen besch\u00e4ftigt sich Klynge t\u00e4glich. F\u00fcr die Vertretung rein wirtschaftlicher Interessen habe das Land andere Organisationen.</p><p>Auch Frankreich hat einen Tech-Botschafter im Silicon Valley</p><p>Quelle: Statista</p><p>Dass bislang so wenige L\u00e4nder auf die Idee gekommen sind, einen Tech-Botschafter zu ernennen, ist verwunderlich. Immerhin: Anfang 2018 ist Frankreich dem Beispiel D\u00e4nemarks gefolgt und hat ebenfalls eine diplomatische Vertretung im Silicon Valley eingerichtet.</p><p>Doch auch wenn D\u00e4nemarks Tech-Botschaft ihren Hauptsitz in den USA hat, haben die Skandinavier l\u00e4ngst begriffen, dass es inzwischen auch andere Technologief\u00fchrer gibt. Insgesamt arbeiten 19 Angestellte f\u00fcr den Tech-Botschafter D\u00e4nemarks - an drei Standorten, neben Palo Alto hat D\u00e4nemark auch Vertretungen in Kopenhagen (f\u00fcr Europa) und Peking eingerichtet.</p><p>\"Ich glaube, wir m\u00fcssen uns ein f\u00fcr alle Mal von der Vorstellung verabschieden, dass China nur produzieren und kopieren kann. Diese Zeiten sind vorbei\", so Klynge gegen\u00fcber Business Insider. In der Volksrepublik geht es heute um Innovation und Unternehmertum, die Startup-Szene ist \u00e4u\u00dferst lebendig. Das Momentum der Innovation in China ist einzigartig auf der Welt. \"Egal ob es um 5G, Biotech oder Healthtech geht - wir m\u00fcssen anerkennen, dass St\u00e4dte wie Shenzen, Shangai oder Guangzhou das n\u00e4chste gro\u00dfe Ding sind\", sagt Klynge.</p><p>China wird zur technologischen Gro\u00dfmacht</p><p>Europa m\u00fcsse China als Technologief\u00fchrer anerkennen, sollte aber auch nicht vergessen, seine Werte zu verteidigen, sagt Klynge. \"Technologie darf nicht von autorit\u00e4ren Systemen missbraucht werden.\" In der Volksrepublik wird Technologie zur Kontrolle und \u00dcberwachung verwendet. Chinas Sozialkreditsytstem, ein Bewertungssystem von B\u00fcrgern auf der Grundlage von Datenbanken, und die staatliche Verwendung von Gesichtserkennungssoftware sind prominente Beispiele daf\u00fcr. \"Dieser Kulturclash wird sich in den kommenden zehn Jahren noch verst\u00e4rken. Ich denke, die Gefahr ist gro\u00df, dass sich andere L\u00e4nder China zum Vorbild nehmen\", erkl\u00e4rt Klynge. Deshalb m\u00fcsse der Westen sicherstellen, dass die transatlantischen Beziehungen stark bleiben.</p><p>Aber wie gef\u00e4hrlich ist China? \"Wenn Sie unter Gefahr die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit in China verstehen - dass das Land die n\u00e4chste Generation von Technologie und Einh\u00f6rnern hervorbringt - dann ist China brandgef\u00e4hrlich\", so der Botschafter. Ein Einhorn bezeichnet ein Startup mit einer Bewertung von mehr als einer Milliarde US-Dollar. Die Entwicklungen bei Firmen wie Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu und dem Ride-Hailing-Dienst Didi seien hocheindrucksvoll und faszinierend, aber auch besorgniserregend, vor allem in puncto K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz (KI).</p><p>KI bewegt sich gerade von einer Phase der Entwicklung hin zur Anwendung. China hat dabei einen gigantischen Vorteil gegen\u00fcber anderen Staaten, denn das bev\u00f6lkerungsreiche Land hat Zugriff auf einen nahezu unersch\u00f6pflichen Datenvorrat, dem Treibstoff des maschinellen Lernens. Kombiniert mit Menschen, die rund um die Uhr arbeiten und den gigantischen Str\u00f6men von Wagniskapital, die in die Volksrepublik fl\u00f6\u00dfen, m\u00fcsse man sich Fragen, ob China nicht bald eine Gro\u00dfmacht der K\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenz werde, sagt Klynge.</p><p>\"Big Tech muss Verantwortung \u00fcbernehmen\"</p><p> \"Die Frage ist, wo bleibt Europa? Sind wir in der Lage, die n\u00e4chste Generation von Einh\u00f6rnern hervorzubringen? K\u00f6nnen wir mit China oder dem Silicon Valley mithalten\", fragt Klynge. Die Antwort d\u00fcrfte Nein lauten. Es sei nun h\u00f6chste Zeit, etwas zu unternehmen, mahnt der Diplomat. Das bedeute massive Investitionen in Technologie und einen viel st\u00e4rkeren Fokus auf die Chancen, die sich dadurch er\u00f6ffnen. \"KI wird alle Lebensbereiche durchdringen. Daher hoffe ich, dass die kommende Europ\u00e4ische Kommission die Technologie in den Fokus r\u00fccken und nicht nur als Beiwerk behandeln wird. Der Zug f\u00e4hrt gerade ab, wir m\u00fcssen versuchen, ihn noch zu kriegen\", so Klynge.</p><p>Ein wichtiger Teil seiner Arbeit ist es deshalb, der globalen Techbranche das europ\u00e4ische Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Technologie zu vermitteln. Der technologische Wandel k\u00f6nne weder vom Privatsektor noch vom Staat allein gestaltet werden. Big Tech sei Teil der Gleichung und m\u00fcsse Verantwortung \u00fcbernehmen. \"Es ist wichtiger denn je, dass wir zusammenhalten und Werte wie Menschenrechte, Demokratie und Marktwirtschaft verteidigen\", erkl\u00e4rt der Botschafter.</p><p>\"Die Zeiten der Selbstregulierung sind vorbei\"</p><p>Trotz Chinas Aufstieg ist das Silicon Valley nach wie vor eines der technologischen Epizentren der Welt. Insbesondere beim Wagniskapital kann kein Ort mit dem Valley konkurrieren. Daher habe sich D\u00e4nemark auch entschieden, den Hauptsitz seiner Tech-Botschaft dorthin zu legen.</p><p>In Europa sei das Verh\u00e4ltnis zwischen Staat und B\u00fcrgern ein anderes als in den USA. In der alten Welt gebe es tendenziell mehr Vertrauen in den Staat, in den USA vertraue man eher dem Privatsektor. Zudem sei Europa regulatorisch strikter als die USA, wie die Europ\u00e4ische Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) oder die Urheberrechtsreform der EU zeigen.</p><p>Lest auch: 21 Fotos aus China, die zeigen, was uns bevorsteht</p><p>\"Was ich allerdings feststelle, ist, dass es allm\u00e4hlich eine Ann\u00e4herung zwischen den amerikanischen und europ\u00e4ischen Ans\u00e4tzen gibt\", sagt Klynge. Kaliforniens neue Datenschutzrichtlinie etwa \u00e4hnelt stark der DSGVO. Washington diskutiert immer h\u00e4ufiger \u00fcber Wettbewerbsrecht und die Regulierung von Big Tech. Laut Klynge seien einfach zu viele Probleme mit den gro\u00dfen Tech-Konzernen entstanden, f\u00fcr eine Selbstregulierung seien sie inzwischen zu gro\u00df geworden. \"Auch im Silicon Valley treffe ich jeden Tag Menschen, die erkennen, dass die Tage reiner Selbstregulierung vorbei sind\", so der Botschafter.</p><p>Weblink: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.de/erster-tech-botschafter-der-welt-warnt-die-innovationsgeschwindigkeit-chinas-ist-brandgefaehrlich-2019-5\">https://www.businessinsider.de/erster-tech-botschafter-der-welt-warnt-die-innovationsgeschwindigkeit-chinas-ist-brandgefaehrlich-2019-5</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDER-163796527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2J-9J41-JBK9-23HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439120</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1228\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 finanzen.net GmbH Alle Rechte vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>Business Insider</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59136\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>8.

Seventy-seven ETF ESG funds have been launched in the first six months of 2018 alone, although the total looks unlikely to eclipse the 214 launched over the course of 2017, according to Morningstar. Globally, there are now 2,953 funds holding ESG mandates, representing nearly $975bn in assets. The vast majority - 2,048 funds - are in Europe, with $652bn in assets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">&lt;h4 &gt;An umbrella term&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite significant growth, the exact definition of an ESG fund can vary greatly. Environmental issues could cover factors such as carbon emissions, whilst social matters could range from gender equality to workers' rights. By contrast, governance issues might address directors' pay or company transparency, for example. Some funds exclude certain companies from an index, such as tobacco and alcohol stocks, while others adopt a 'best-in-class' approach, selecting securities across different sectors and geographies that have a higher ESG rating than their peers.</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/image/document/2016-44/feedback_final_pc_30068_en_19173.pdf\">2016 report from the European Commission</url> on long-term and sustainable investment found that there was \"insufficient knowledge about ESG in the investment universe\" and \"lack of clarity around main ESG concepts and definitions giving rise to diverging interpretations\". In France for example, the energy transition law, known as Article 173, requires institutional investors to report how they incorporate ESG factors and tackle climate change. Perhaps it is no coincidence that Lyxor and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://https://hub.ipe.com/amundi-asset-management/414948.supplier\">Amundi</url>, two French ETF providers, were some of the first to enter the ESG market more than a decade ago with low carbon and water ETFs.</p><p>In May this year, the European Commission <url normalizedValue=\"http://https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/180308-action-plan-sustainable-growth-factsheet_en.pdf\">announced plans to regulate</url> and unify the ESG market. This includes creating an EU-wide classification system, as well as improving disclosure requirements for institutional investors as to how they integrate ESG factors in their risk processes and producing a new category of benchmarks to help people identify their investments' carbon footprint. This is, according to European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis, to prevent \"greenwashing\" - or the mis-selling of a product as green.</p><p>\"Today we already have green labels for organic food, energy efficient appliances such as fridges, or building materials,\" he said. \"In the same way, we could have an EU Ecolabel for green bonds or investment funds, to give trust that an investment is actually green.\"</p><p>The classification system could be implemented by 2020, Dombrovskis said, and then be expanded to social and governance objectives, which in turn affect ESG ETFs.\u00a0</p><p>\"From a product manufacturer point of view, as it's difficult to anticipate what the provisions will be, and we will have to adapt\u00a0and find indexes suitable to the evolving requirements,\" says Isabelle Bourcier, global head of quantitative and index at BNP Paribas.</p><p>\"Our ETFs are distributed in mainly continental European countries and the MSCI SRI methodology is probably the most common ground at this stage when we discuss ESG with retail and institutional clients.\"</p><p>As of June 2018, there were $11.8bn of assets tied to ETFs tracking\u00a0MSCI\u00a0ESG indexes globally, $7bn of which is listed in Europe.</p><p>Laurent Trottier, global head of ETF, indexing and smart beta management at Amundi, says he is \"not convinced\" that there would be a single definition agreed in the near future, adding that one label would be a positive thing for the ETF industry.</p><p>\"Clearly, speaking the same language between providers, investors, regulators and market participants, and having the same expectations, would help improve the capacity to promote and manage ESG products,\" he says.</p><p>&lt;h4 &gt;The audience for ESG&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p>The dominance of institutional investors in the ESG space might help to explain the lack of standardisation, notes Steffen Scheuble, CEO of index provider Solactive.\u00a0</p><p>\"Different investors have different views. As a result, you have more indexes which are tailored for a specific approach and less 'one fits all'. Due to separately managed accounts and mandates, ESG indexes are often tailored for one institutional investor.\"</p><p>Deborah Yang, head of index, EMEA, at MSCI, points out that ETF assets in ESG are not broken down into retail versus institutional. \"There is over $180bn in non-ETF assets tracking MSCI\u00a0ESG indices and the vast majority of these assets is currently institutional,\" she adds.\u00a0</p><p>\"ESG investing is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has been accelerating in the last three to four years, and like other investment trends, such as factor investing, institutional investors tend to drive adoption and retail investors follow.\"\u00a0</p><p>A <url normalizedValue=\"http://https://www.cerulli.com/publications/us-environmental-social-and-corporate-governance-investing-2017-assessing-true-client-demand-for-esg-criteria-P0003K9\">2017 report</url> from US-based research firm Cerulli Associates, found that although asset managers believe demand for ESG will come from millennial investors, assets will only be accumulated slowly.</p><p>\"Firms recognise that in order to draw attention from younger millennial investors, they need to begin to highlight their ESG capabilities,\" the report said. \"Managers believe next-generation clients are fully prepared to fire their advisers unless they put impact or values or missions into their asset allocation; therefore, they are beginning to make it a priority now.\"</p><p>Trottier agrees there has been a recent shift in investor expectations and mindset. He says that-two thirds of queries from clients from the passive equity portfolio team include ESG criteria, and that this trend is starting to emerge among fixed income clients.</p><p>\"I can't say whether that shift is due to an increase in offers from index providers or whether index providers are following the trend - it's a chicken-and-egg situation; however, we believe that it is here to last,\" he said.</p><p>&lt;h4 &gt;Breaking into fixed income&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p>While the majority of ESG assets are in equity ETFs, the past couple of years have seen more fixed income products. For example, the Amundi Index US Corp UCITS ETF <url normalizedValue=\"http://https://www.amundietf.co.uk/professional/product/view/LU1806495575?xtnp=1&amp;xtcr=39\">(UCRP)</url> tracks an index of corporate-grade bonds, excluding issuers involved in alcohol, tobacco, gambling, military weapons, nuclear power, adult entertainment, civilian firearms and genetically modified organisms. Launched in late May, it already has approximately EUR221m under management.</p><p>Green, or social, bonds, whereby money is ring-fenced to have a positive, social impact, are another growing area of interest. Lxyor launched the Lyxor Green Bond UCITS ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"http://https://www.lyxoretf.co.uk/en/instit/products/fixed-income-etf/lyxor-green-bond-dr-ucits-etf-acc/lu1563454310/eur\">CLIM</url>) in February last year, and it now has approximately EUR53m under management. CLIM tracks a range of global green bonds deemed eligible by the Climate Bonds Initiative, an independent not-for-profit organisation that advocates low-carbon investments.\u00a0</p><p>\"The topic of social bonds could be one of the next areas - that is something we are investigating,\" says Solactive's Scheuble, which has $80bn of ETF assets tied to its indices, including in low carbon, water and gender equality.</p><p>Within the broader market of fixed income, the lack of underlying securities that qualify for inclusion in an ESG index is also an issue. Andrew Walsh, executive director, head of passive and ETF specialist sales, UK and Ireland at UBS, which has $3.5bn in ESG ETFs, explains that the methodology for fixed income ESG ETFs is a \"little bit looser\".\u00a0</p><p>\"MSCI ESG's scoring system has seven bands for companies, from AAA to CCC. To be included for consideration, an equity must have at least a single A,\" he said. \"Within\u00a0liquid corporates\u00a0fixed income\u00a0indices, this\u00a0minimum\u00a0hurdle is\u00a0a score of\u00a0BBB. This slightly looser inclusion criteria ensures there are enough securities to choose from.\"\u00a0</p><p>&lt;h4 &gt;Lack of data&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p>As the 2016 report from the EC found, industry participants reported that harnessing Big Data is an issue, citing how it is often needed to analyse other asset classes, or dig deeper into individual sectors and themes - including gender equality.</p><p>The EUR53m Lyxor Global Gender Equality UCITS ETF (<url normalizedValue=\"http://https://www.lyxoretf.co.uk/en/instit/products/equity-etf/lyxor-global-gender-equality-dr-ucits-etf-acc/lu1691909508/eur\">GEND</url>) launched in October 2017. It tracks an index of 150 companies around the world that score highly on 19 criteria defined by research firm Equileap, including the pay gap, maternity/paternity leave and senior female representation.</p><p>\"We looked at the UN's sustainable investment goals and women's rights is one of the cornerstones of that,\" says Adam Laird, head of ETF strategy, Northern Europe, at Lyxor. \"The data from Equileap allowed us to work to construct an index in line with that goal and get the first ETF off the ground.\"</p><p>The firm now has $550m tied to products that license its data. Equileap CEO Diana van Maasdijk says she aims to add extra parameters in future, such as sex-based violence at work.</p><p>\"If we expand the research the existing ETF doesn't change but it could apply to future indexes and products,\" she says.</p><p>Investors are also becoming more aware that gender equality contributes to a healthy bottom line. A <url normalizedValue=\"http://https://evolveetfs.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Credit-Suisse-Reward-for-Change_1495660293279_2.pdf\">2016 report</url> from Credit Suisse found that companies with at least one female director had generated an excess return of 3.5% for investors over the previous decade.\u00a0</p><p>&lt;h4 &gt;Fees bite&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p>Another potential hurdle for ESG investors is relatively high fees. Data from Lipper found that the average annual fee for ESG ETFs in Europe is 41 basis points (bps), compared with 37bps for normal equity ETFs, as of June 2018. These prices have only come down by 2bps in each category since 2016.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's higher turnover in\u00a0the underlying constituents in\u00a0ESG ETFs than in an\u00a0ETF which tracks\u00a0a\u00a0standard\u00a0index; it's more expensive to run these funds,\" says Walsh.</p><p>\"Costs will undoubtedly fall,\" adds Laird at Lyxor. \"We will probably see a proliferation of strategies as it's still relatively niche.\"</p><p>&lt;h4 &gt;Does ESG mean less return?&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p>Investors have also long debated whether ESG detracts from returns as it limits the number of stocks available to portfolio managers.</p><p>\"I would say that none of the research I've seen was extremely conclusive,\" says Trottier. \"I believe that ESG is no longer just about green, ethical values, but more about managing risk and return, which is in fact a very traditional framework for any portfolio manager. The more we invest in ESG, the more we facilitate the outperformance of the best-behaving companies and the underperformance of the worst-behaving companies.\"</p><p>Over the past five years, Walsh says UBS's ETF tracking the euro-zone SRI index has outperformed the parent index by 2.11% per annum, whereas the exclusion of big tech stocks has hampered SRI ETF performance in the US, as has the underweighting of China in emerging market SRI ETFs.</p><p>\"It's not like all SRI indices have the same performance against their respective parent indices,\" says Walsh. \"While the Eurozone (EMU) SRI has outperformed the parent, non-SRI index, massively in recent years, it doesn't mean all SRI indices outperform the parents. In fact, with emerging markets SRI, it has underperformed. The simple point being that there is not one absolute situation where SRI outperforms all the time.\"</p><p>Lyxor's Laird adds that ESG funds generally performed well between 2005 and 2007. But after the financial crisis, they tended to underperform as they screened out natural resources and mining companies.</p><p>\"Is that a failing of these funds? I don't think so,\" he says. \"It's just a recognition you're getting performance from different areas at different times.\"\u00a0</p><p>According to the EC's 2016 report, sustainable finance may not become the norm for years, or even decades. But Solactive's Scheuble notes that though there is still \"more talk than assets\" when it comes to ESG, investor trends are moving in the right direction.</p><p>\"From my perspective we are right at the beginning,\" he says. \"But I'm convinced that every ETF provider will offer ESG products in the future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IPEMAG-10027007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IPEMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDN-X1P1-JDNS-J1B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">349989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IPE International Publishers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investment &amp;

Subscribe to our ESG Insider newsletter, and listen to the latest ESG Insider podcast on SoundCloud, Spotify and iTunes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From climate change to the gender pay gap to data privacy   the past decade was a big one for ESG.</p><p>In 2019, we brought you stories from around the globe about how companies are responding to increasing investor and regulatory focus on ESG. We covered how PG&amp;E Corp. became a cautionary tale about the damage climate change can wreak on a successful company. And we wrote about the CEOs of major companies shifting their focus from just turning a profit to helping all stakeholders.</p><p>This past year we also explored the lack of diversity in clinical drug trials. We investigated how the chocolate industry, fashion brands and supermarket chains are implicit in forced labor, and how they're tackling the problem. And we delved into the ways of developing countries around the world are working to make financial services more available to their populations.</p><p>In this week's newsletter, we bring you highlights from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's ESG news coverage and ESG Insider podcast in 2019. Thanks for reading, and see you in 2020.</p><p>Featured Series</p><p>Hard Labor: Dutch raise the bar in chocolate industry's fight against child labor</p><p>In a series of stories and podcasts, we investigated the challenge of forced labor in global supply chains and the consequences for companies, investors and consumers.

This series examines how clinical trials for everything from cancer to cardiovascular diseases have a proven lack of diversity among their participants, raising concerns that the medications from those trials may not work appropriately for everyone.</p><p>Overpowered: Why a U.S. gas-building spree continues despite electricity glut</p><p>Utilities, faced with a steady stream of coal plant retirements and the allure of historically low natural gas prices, have continued to build new gas plants despite flat electricity demand and rapidly falling prices for energy from renewable sources.

They all agreed this year to lobby Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest social media companies about content. </p><p>It all started this spring, after a massacre in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. That country\u2019s $41bn sovereign wealth fund, the \u201cNZ Super Fund\u201d, started the first global investor coalition to campaign about social media issues. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://nzsuperfund.nz/news-media/social-media-investor-initiative-%E2%80%93-update-un-christchurch-call-meetings\"> NZ Super says</url> the aim is to engage with Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet, which owns YouTube \u201cto strengthen controls to prevent the livestreaming and distribution of objectionable content\u201d \u2014 and thus prevent a replay of the shooting, which was livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>Thus far, success has been mixed. Almost 100 asset managers, controlling $13tn in assets, have signed up. Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet have duly promised to address their complaints. However, images of the Christchurch massacre continue to circulate on social media platforms, and so does other extremist content.</p><p>Despite this mixed scorecard, investors should take note. This action reveals a bigger shift: investors involved in environmental, social and governance issues are starting to campaign for reform of Big Tech, using tactics developed in sectors such as oil and gas. This will almost certainly accelerate in 2020, given that many ESG funds are, perhaps ironically, already big tech investors.</p><p>The change is striking: until recently tech companies were deemed to be more ESG compliant than many other business sectors. Many of the biggest groups have long embraced progressive causes such as gay rights, and Google and Apple have built headquarters that are deliberately green. They also earned high (ish) ESG scores because some tech innovations do social and environmental good. This week, a Carbon Trust study commissioned by the telecoms industry estimated that the use of mobile technology enabled people <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/mobile-technologies-enabling-huge-carbon-reductions-in-response-to-climate-emergency/#_edn1\"> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions</url> by 2,135m tonnes last year \u2014 comparable to the yearly emissions of Russia. </p><p>But ESG activists are now worried about different Big Tech behaviours. They take issue with tech companies\u2019 attitude towards data privacy and their role in enabling government and corporate surveillance. Apple faces a showdown over free speech policies at its next annual general meeting. Activist shareholders have pressed for a vote on the issue after complaints that the company kowtowed to Beijing when it removed a controversial mapping app during the Hong Kong protests.</p><p>Another flash point is the state of tech companies\u2019 global supply chains. This week a human rights group sued Apple, Google, Microsoft, Dell and Tesla over alleged abuses in the African cobalt mines that the groups rely on for minerals. ESG activist investors are considering launching shareholder suits over similar allegations around human rights and environmental abuses.</p><p>These actions won\u2019t change conduct by themselves. The biggest tech groups are so absurdly cash rich that their executives can afford to ignore divestment threats and lending boycotts. That puts the sector in a different category from shipping, where banks and investors are imposing tougher green standards.</p><p>Dual class share structures that give founders outsized voting rights also make it harder to hold these companies to account. In May, Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg easily crushed a sensible shareholder campaign for corporate governance reform that was backed by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ri.gov/press/view/37245\"> BlackRock and Goldman Sachs</url>.</p><p>But ESG activists hope that highlighting issues which have often been ignored in the past might eventually prod regulators or consumers to act. </p><p>In the short term, change might come from another source: employee activism. In September, more than 1,500 Amazon staff members staged a walkout demanding that the company reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2030. Chief executive Jeff Bezos is now speeding up environmental reforms.</p><p>Google employees have staged protests over gender issues and early work on a censored Chinese search engine. While Facebook employee protests have been less visible, a senior official says that \u201cmany of us strongly agree with the NZ Super [campaign]\u201d \u2014 and are using it as an excuse to demand reform. </p><p>This does not equate to the revolution activists want; nor will it placate concerns about antitrust and privacy. But it is an important ESG evolution. Let us hope that it forces tech executives to address long-ignored issues in 2020; it is overdue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p>Follow Gillian Tett with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/gillian-tett\"> myFT</url> and on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/gilliantett\">Twitter</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-adee5360226511eab8a1584213ee7b2b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSK-4FD1-JB77-K1PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><timeReceived>4:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00026S0</classCode><className>LEGAL &amp;

The fund says that these companies are failing to meet community standards, but are likely to deliver poorer financial results too. There is plenty of evidence that diverse boards perform better, so there is no excuse for not shaping up. So far seven companies have had their shares sold off, with all those companies based in Japan, and were part of Future Fund\u2019s only international exposure. </p><p> The fund has reached out to Australian companies, and found them largely responsive, however there are still plenty of male-only boards in Australian companies.  APRA says soon there\u2019ll be no such thing as \u2018sustainable\u2019 finance - it\u2019ll all be green  The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) head of insurance Geoff Summerhayes flagged climate change risks as soon to be at the heart of all financial decisions that APRA-regulated entities have to make, speaking at an ACSI conference. There will be no such thing, he explained, as \u2018sustainable\u2019 finance; all finance must be sustainable. Green finance will be the only kind we have.  Summerhayes confirmed that APRA does not see climate change as a moral issue, but a directly financial one. Australia\u2019s regulation already covers all financial risks, so there is no need for new regulation - it\u2019s adaptable and guidelines will continue to be updated to reflect ESG importance.  Australian Ethical campaigning against gambling investments in super  A new marketing campaign launched by Australian Ethical is trying to encourage consumers to think about how they feel about their superannuation being invested in the gambling industry. While it may be a good investment - Australians gamble more than any other country, losing $23 billion each year - the negative impacts on our communities is not in dispute.  Exposure to gambling via superannuation can be direct or indirect, and may not be easily distinguished - supermarket chains, for example, may be an indirect exposure, while Crown is direct.  Christchurch Call gains traction   The summit in Paris launched by New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron, </nameText></person>the Christchurch Call, has seen very broad support. Attended by big tech companies and government representatives, the Christchurch Call outlines a set of voluntary commitments that governments and online service providers can agree to, to help prevent terrorist and extremist violence spreading online.  Google, Facebook, Twitter, Daily Motion and Amazon have all agreed. This means the companies will take specific measures to prevent the uploading of terrorist and extremist content, and take measures to manage the risks of this content being shared via live streaming. Algorithms will also be reviewed.  Governments who agreed will commit to enforcing the laws that already exist that make the production and spreading of terrorist content illegal. The Australian Government rushed through a social media law, that has been criticised as being a poorly-thought-out bill that did not undergo proper consultation, which may result in undesirable consequences.  The initial group of investors who started the initiative now has 55 funds, including the original group. The Christchurch Call has been agreed to by 18 countries and eight tech companies.  Ethics Centre launching FASEA-approved financial adviser course  A FASEA-approved bridging course is to be piloted later in 2019 with an Australian university for financial advisers. The course will help advisers to meet the requirements of the Financial Adviser Standards and Ethics Authority (FASEA) reforms.  The Ethics Centre has run the Ethical Professional Program for the financial services industry since 2016. The Ethics Centre is a non-profit organisation that offers ethics programs aimed at the business community.    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN1038898420190521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5H-NG61-J9XT-P3BV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 21, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

If the recent job numbers are to be believed (unemployment down to 6 percent), we have recovered from the downturn that struck the graduates of the Class of 2008. Yet, the reality is far from it.  </p><p>Graduates and, more broadly, millennials need to get comfortable with the unknown.<br/><br/> \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be the same. They\u2019re just going to have to get cozy with the idea of not knowing where the work may come from,\u201d a friend said, who is now spearheading a new program for social innovation in Washington, D.C.<br/><br/> While the corporate gigs will continue to be out there, and the recruiters for consultancy companies, banks and high-flying corporates will still have the means to hit up college campuses, the real \u201cjobs\u201d are more dispersed.<br/><br/> Even if you\u2019re not a millennial or a recent grad, work has evolved to include new opportunities. Two of the big tech stories recently have been Airbnb and Uber.<br/><br/> Airbnb enables everyday folks to rent out their home or apartment to travelers for short stays. It allows everyone to run a bed-and-breakfast style business on the side \u2014 be it a single room, a flat or an entire villa.<br/><br/> Uber, a car service app, is becoming a popular alternative to taxis. Need a car to take you to your meeting? Pop open the Uber app, which will display all the Uber \u201ctaxis\u201d available in your area, and you\u2019ll have a real-time estimate of the next available vehicle. Licensed drivers who want to earn some extra income can work as many hours \u2014 and when \u2014 they want to.<br/><br/> These companies are not just impacting local economies here in the U.S. Rather, they\u2019re global. They\u2019ve become such a threat to existing structures \u2014 most notably, hotels and taxis \u2014 that some cities are debating if they need some regulation.<br/><br/> Airbnb is estimated to be worth near $10 billion, more than the Hyatt hotel chain. Uber raised over $250 million from investors in Silicon Valley to expand its efforts into new cities. Brussels actually got rid of Uber. Seattle put a quota on the number of vehicles it could have on its roads. And in New York City, the hotel industry is battling Airbnb on regulations for letting out rooms to visitors.<br/><br/> In this new economy though, you have to, as the Economist put it, ruffle a few feathers to survive. Both platforms are a threat mainly because they\u2019re letting people determine their incomes \u2014 not a company, not a boss, not a contract is determining how much they can make.<br/><br/> They\u2019re not unique, though. They\u2019re part of a larger trend that is shifting back the pressure of work, finances and income to the individual. Mere loyalty at a company will not cut it anymore.<br/><br/> While it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable, it\u2019s also thrilling. You\u2019re the boss again \u2014 whether you like it or not. That\u2019s why I see friends who are starting businesses daily. Some are artisans, employing their skills to revive handicraft work and artisanship. Some are marketing geniuses, using their expertise to polish editorial work for companies.<br/><br/> But when you start a company, project, organization, consultancy service \u2014 whatever you call it \u2014 be sure to know the customer and know the gap that you\u2019re aiming to fill. These tech success stories, Uber and Airbnb, triumphed because they saw how inefficient taxi systems were in cities such as San Francisco, and how limited (and expensive) hotel rooms were in places like New York City. They knew what they were targeting.<br/><br/> And they executed well. Today\u2019s tests for the new professional are not orchestrated by a boss, or based on an annual review. They\u2019re designed by the market.

Desta vez, n\u00e3o se limitam a torcer o nariz como aconteceu quando do surgimento do bitcoin e das outras moedas do g\u00eanero. Agora, percebem que, se funcionar como foi anunciado, a libra produzir\u00e1 uma revolu\u00e7\u00e3o que, entre outros efeitos, pode tirar megafatias do mercado dos bancos. A revolu\u00e7\u00e3o acontecer\u00e1 n\u00e3o s\u00f3 porque oferecer\u00e1 aplicativo para pagamentos, tanto dos mais simples quanto de grandes transfer\u00eancias de capitais a custos insignificantes, mas tamb\u00e9m porque pretende trabalhar com uma moeda de larga aceita\u00e7\u00e3o, sem redes banc\u00e1rias, sem banco central e sem entidades supervisoras. </p><p>Entre as primeiras rea\u00e7\u00f5es das autoridades respons\u00e1veis, h\u00e1 aquelas que pregam a proibi\u00e7\u00e3o pura e simples dessas novidades digitais, alegadamente pelo seu potencial devastador, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 de varrer para o al\u00e9m o sistema banc\u00e1rio, como tamb\u00e9m de provocar corridas e o p\u00e2nico que sempre as acompanha em casos de grave crise de confian\u00e7a. Nesse caso, Tesouros e bancos centrais das principais pot\u00eancias n\u00e3o teriam outra sa\u00edda sen\u00e3o intervir para evitar o colapso, a custos que, de um jeito ou de outro, seriam transferidos para o contribuinte. Nessa dire\u00e7\u00e3o seguiu, por exemplo, o artigo de Katharina Pistor, na edi\u00e7\u00e3o de 22 de junho do di\u00e1rio londrino The Telegraph. Numa linha bem diferente, h\u00e1 aqueles que n\u00e3o pretendem acabar com essas iniciativas, mas control\u00e1-las antes que produzam consequ\u00eancias nefastas irrevers\u00edveis. Entre eles est\u00e1 o ministro das Finan\u00e7as da Fran\u00e7a, Bruno Le Maire, que pediu regula\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1: \"As empresas de tecnologia n\u00e3o podem operar em um nirvana regulat\u00f3rio\". Outros, como o presidente do Banco da Inglaterra (banco central), Mark Carney, entendem que projetos como esses devem merecer tratamento parecido com o dos bancos. Essas novas moedas digitais e as entidades por elas respons\u00e1veis devem ser submetidas a supervis\u00e3o superior. A elas devem, inclusive, ser oferecidas contas nos bancos centrais, que poderiam formar reservas t\u00e9cnicas para poder enfrentar eventuais crises de confian\u00e7a. O BIS (Bank of International Settlements), institui\u00e7\u00e3o que atua em Basileia (Su\u00ed\u00e7a) como uma esp\u00e9cie de banco central dos bancos centrais, em seu \u00faltimo relat\u00f3rio, no cap\u00edtulo intitulado Big Tech in Finance: Opportunities and risks, tamb\u00e9m sugeriu que as novas moedas digitais e as institui\u00e7\u00f5es que vierem a emiti-las tenham tratamento equivalente ao dos bancos. E h\u00e1 os demais, que preferem esperar para ver. Pedem cautela at\u00e9 que se tenha melhor conhecimento do potencial de atua\u00e7\u00e3o e dos riscos envolvidos na circula\u00e7\u00e3o dessas moedas. A hip\u00f3tese de proibir pura e simplesmente a cria\u00e7\u00e3o dessas moedas e sua atua\u00e7\u00e3o no segmento de pagamentos de transfer\u00eancias de recursos e de cr\u00e9dito parece imposs\u00edvel diante do que j\u00e1 se sabe. Na China, por exemplo, a Alipay j\u00e1 atua nesses mercados. A pr\u00f3pria iniciativa do Facebook come\u00e7a a ser entendida como resposta ocidental (ou americana) aos novos avan\u00e7os da tecnologia de ponta da China e, eventualmente, tamb\u00e9m da R\u00fassia. Ou seja, bloquear o Facebook nesse projeto poder\u00e1 escancarar portas e janelas a outras high techs ocidentais, como Amazon e Apple. E, mais que tudo, poder\u00e1 deixar passagem aberta para novos drag\u00f5es digitais asi\u00e1ticos, como o Alibaba. A outra op\u00e7\u00e3o, a de dar a essas novidades tratamento semelhante aos dos bancos, implicar\u00e1 assumir que fatias importantes da rede banc\u00e1ria global possam desaparecer em poucos anos. Ou, ent\u00e3o, exigir\u00e1 que os bancos e bancos centrais tamb\u00e9m entrem nesses novos mercados e usem as mesmas tecnologias. Se for por a\u00ed, provavelmente ser\u00e1 preciso reconvocar os encontros de Bretton Woods (de 1944), que criaram o Fundo Monet\u00e1rio Internacional e redesenharam o sistema monet\u00e1rio global. Nessas reuni\u00f5es, o maior economista do s\u00e9culo 20, John Maynard Keynes, j\u00e1 sugerira a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de uma moeda universal, o bancor, que, no entanto, n\u00e3o foi adiante porque contrariou os interesses imediatos dos Estados Unidos, que preferiram e obtiveram a conversibilidade do d\u00f3lar em ouro. Cautela pode ser, por ora, a melhor atitude a ser adotada at\u00e9 que se conhe\u00e7a o alcance das novas tecnologias. Mas o princ\u00edpio de precau\u00e7\u00e3o aplicado \u00e0s moedas digitais n\u00e3o pode demorar demais, sob pena de se defrontar com fatos consumados de enorme alcance. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTDSP-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTDSP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJB-8B51-F19D-72RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357682</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Ag\u00eancia Estado Todos os direitos reservados</copyright><publicationName>O Estado de S.Paulo</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64421\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>11 Julho 2019 Quinta-feira</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Jornal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>PORTUGUESE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>PORTUGU\u00caS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>Digital Currency</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>Securities + Other Investments</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00097LT</classCode><className>Labor Force</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001621</classCode><className>Spot Market</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>Economic Conditions</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00096KM</classCode><className>Real Estate Investing</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It's not that Apple Inc. or Facebook Inc. didn't give a fig before. It's just that they've come to realize that people doubt their sincerity when it comes to industry slogans like \"Don't be evil.\" </p><p>All the main players face questions about whether they harm democracy, people's health, fair competition, economic equality and privacy. This has been front-page news throughout this year and a hot topic in business circles and among politicians on the left and right. It makes sense, then, that tech companies are concerned. And that's showing up in varying degrees with charm offensives and less public attempts at molding the perception of their impact on the world. The most visible effort to combat tech backlash is Mark Zuckerberg's highly public tour of America, which featured Facebook's billionaire chief executive attending an African-American church in South Carolina, chatting with recovering drug addicts in Ohio and sitting on a tractor at a farm in Wisconsin. Zuckerberg also wrote a long manifesto about his mission to make Facebook foster stronger communities in real life. And his family's money is also funding an ambitious philanthropic organization. I don't want to imply that Zuckerberg isn't earnest about trying to make Facebook, or his wealth, forces for good. But his quasi-presidential tour was also useful to tilt the narrative away from the escalating political and social crises faced this year by big technology companies, including his. And he's not the only tech titan trying to shape his company's image for the better. Apple CEO Tim Cook is no stranger to scandals about how Apple suppliers mistreat workers or the environmental harm of smartphones. This year, he has continued to speak out about those subjects while criticizing misinformation campaigns online and pledging to protect customers' digital information. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos used to mostly tweet about his cool personal space initiatives. Now his Twitter account is threaded with anecdotes about good works. He has solicited suggestions on his philanthropy, highlighted news that Amazon planes were transporting supplies to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico and retweeted an article about a 7-year-old who used Amazon's gift registry to create a food pantry. The company has also been busy behind the scenes countering news articles that suggest it is harming other retailers, weighing down local economies or squashing competition. There's less direct evidence of Google's perception campaigns, but news organizations this year have reported on ways that its parent company, Alphabet Inc., has sought to shape opinions by swaying research on its influence and backing legal scholars who support the way the search giant uses its market power. Big tech companies' feel-good campaigns are also accompanied by hardheaded lobbying in pursuit of their interests. Google has for some time been one of the savviest power brokers in Washington, although its influence may be waning. The other big U.S. technology companies are quickly learning to navigate the Beltway. Google and Amazon are among the biggest corporate spenders on federal lobbying this year, and Facebook isn't far behind, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Washington is now rethinking its relatively light-touch regulation of internet companies, and the tech companies have been working behind the scenes to counteract or reshape proposed legislation that would require more disclosure of political ads on their websites and potentially expose them to legal liability for users' digital activity. There is a sometimes awkward contrast between the tech giants' warm-and-fuzzy image-shaping efforts and their sharp-elbowed maneuvering in pursuit of political and regulatory goals. It's understandable for big tech to find multiple approaches to tackle the backlash against their size, wealth and influence. Being forced to account for their rising power was the biggest industry theme of 2017, and the reckoning will continue. So these companies can't stop at talk and mythmaking.

Statements made on this conference call regarding expected operating results and other future events are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. <br/>Forward-looking statements are made based on current expectations, assumptions, and beliefs as well as information available to the Company at this time. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Further information about these risks can be found in the Company's filings with the SEC. <br/>When we get to the question and answer portion, management asks that you be respectful of everyone's time and limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. <br/>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Michael Schall, President and Chief Executive Officer for Essex Property Trust . Thank you, Mr. Schall, you may begin. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Thank you, April. Thank you for joining us today and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments. John Eudy and Erik Alexander are here in attendance for Q&amp;A. <br/>This past quarter John Burkart assumed leadership of our Asset Management and Operations functions and, thus, he will provide commentary for those activities today and in the future. Also, as you know, Angela became CFO on October 1 upon Mike Dance's retirement. Please join me in welcoming both of them to their new roles on the quarterly call. <br/>I'll cover the following topics on the call. First, Q3 results and activities. Second, an update on rent control discussions. Third, review of investment markets and, fourth, comments on our 2016 preliminary market forecast. On to the first topic. <br/>Yesterday, we were pleased to report another impressive quarter driven by strong West Coast economies. As expected, demand from robust job growth led to continued high occupancy for apartments and significant increases in for-sale home prices. Thus our reported results for same-property revenue, NOI, and core FFO per share growth exceeded our expectations and led the multi-family industry. As to the quarterly results, I would like to recognize the Essex team for their tremendous effort and for exceeding expectations once again. <br/>With a few exceptions, rents at B quality property and locations are growing faster than As, exemplified in the Oakland Metro with 12.7% same property revenue growth, the highest in our portfolio. Despite the fact that the Oakland Metro generated only 2.2% year-over-year job growth for the nine months ended September, that significantly lagged San Francisco and San Jose at 4.6% and 5.5% respectively. This occurred because affordability and commute time are two critical considerations for most apartment seekers. With traffic congestion growing, the accessibility to major employment centers has become incredibly challenging and more people are doubling up, living with relatives, or moving to less expensive areas. Thus, we believe that B locations closest to jobs and public transit will continue to perform best in 2016. <br/>In recent investor meetings we have heard concerns about tech hiring and changing housing preferences favoring homeownership. As to tech hiring, we closely follow tech job growth, especially in the current environment given broader economic issues such as the strength of the US dollar, weak commodity prices, weak global growth and the divergence and performance of key sectors of the economy. The Essex portfolio will normally experience softness in traffic and pricing a month or two before slowdown in hiring is picked up by the data vendors. This is complicated to some extent by the normal seasonal slowdown that is typical in the apartment business this time of year. At this point, we have not experienced a slowdown beyond normal seasonal patterns and reported job growth has been excellent. Perhaps the best way to demonstrate the current condition is the 2% improvement in loss to lead at the end of Q3 from 5% at the end of September 2014 to 7% at September 30, 2015. <br/><br/>As to the home ownership rate, we continue to focus on the relationship between the number of new homes, both rental and for sale, that are being delivered compared to household formations estimated from employment growth. We have heard some economists use national data when discussing this relationship, which we believe is often misleading. Apartments are a local business and therefore, our valuation of supply and demand is regionally focused. For a variety of reasons, including the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and related law, we continue to expect very muted production of for-sale housing in the coastal metros of California as cities implement an urban village housing concept accessed by a robust public transit system. This new concept is likely to take years to implement and will favor apartments and condos. Therefore, we believe it is the unlikely that there will be a significant increase in for-sale housing production that is necessary to materially increase the home ownership rate in Coastal California. <br/>On a second topic, rent control. I commented last quarter that proposals for local rent control ordinances are being discussed in several West Coast cities, particularly in California. Cities are generally protective of their rental stock and voters that live in apartments, and there is a growing concern that high-income tech workers will displace other residents that have not received large increases in compensation. I have commented on previous calls about Richmond, California, which is the first city to approve in preliminary form a draft of rent control ordinance. Opposition lead by the California Apartment Association has been able to force the Richmond rent control proposal to the voters in 2016. <br/>For context, California State law supersedes city ordinances. Fortunately for landlords, state law mandates vacancy decontrol and prohibits rent control on apartments completed after 1995. We have also seen some cities and community organizations focused on the long-term impact of inadequate housing supply, particularly at lower income levels, and acknowledge that rent control has unintended negative consequences and ignores the real issue, that is the shortage of housing production. <br/>Our view is that there is no near-term solution to the housing shortages, especially in Northern California, because cities are generally not supportive of pro growth strategies. Entitlements for new housing continue to be challenging and costly to obtain, and construction costs have spiked around 10% in each of the past two years. Therefore, we don't expect the rent control discussion to end any time soon. We encourage landlords to self-regulate by considering these factors as part of their lease renewal strategies. <br/>Third topic, investments. As commented previously, we've become more selective as to our external growth activities, although we continue to be very active in our search for both acquisition and development deals. As noted previously, construction cost increases are pressuring developing yields and some development deals are likely to solve. The flip side of a more selective acquisition market is a better market for property sales. You should expect to see the level of dispositions increase modestly in 2016. <br/>Cap rates remained low throughout our markets. Using the cap rate methodology of the most active buyers, our best estimate is that the highest quality property and locations trade around 4% cap while B quality property and locations trade around a 4.5% cap rate. Lesser quality properties trade at higher cap rates than periodically and aggressively under written or trophy property will trade in the high 3% cap rate range. Some buyers make more aggressive assumptions that can add 25 to 50 basis points to the cap rate, compared again to the yields underwritten by more active buyers. <br/>On to the fourth topic, which is our market outlook for 2016. Page S16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply, demand, and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectations for 2016. As before, we assume each of our West Coast metros, except Ventura, will outperform the national average job growth assumed to be 2%. While we are not projecting the continuation of the exceptional job growth that we have enjoyed in 2015, we have no specific reason that hiring is going to moderate other than the concerns about the global economy noted previously. Note that we do not need extraordinary job growth to generate favorable supply/demand relationship and great results. Should job growth continue at the pace experienced in 2015, we are likely to exceed the forecasted results for market rents shown on our market outlook. <br/>Finally, the 2016 same-property revenue growth expectations for the Essex portfolio are likely to exceed the forecasted 6% economic rent growth on S16 due to our healthy loss to lease and other factors, all of which will be discussed as part of our 2016 guidance on the next call. This concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I'll turn the call over to John Burkart.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Burkart</emphasis> (Senior EVP, Asset Management): <br/> Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate the hard work the Operations and Asset Management teams this last quarter, executing our plan which has enabled our great results. Third quarter was robust and we continue to have a positive outlook for all our markets. Higher than expected job growth continues to be the primary catalyst for increasing rents and high occupancies throughout the portfolio. The strong demand pushed economic rents higher, leading to our fourth consecutive quarter of 10% increases in same-store property NOI growth. <br/>Gains from renewal activity increased 6.6% portfoliowide in the quarter, and our turnover was down across the portfolio from 63% in 2014 to 60% this quarter. As of yesterday, the same property portfolio in all regions had occupancy at or above 96% with a 30-day availability of just over 4.7%. All of our markets are benefiting from the combination of strong job and income growth and insufficient supply to keep up with the demand. According to Axiometrics, market rent growth was stronger in September 2015 year-over-year than last year at this time in each of our regions, Seattle, Bay Area, and Southern  California. So while we're not giving guidance for next year, we conclude from this that our markets are as strong or stronger than last year at this time, which bodes well for next year. <br/>Ramping up our redevelopment pipeline has been a major focus for 2015, including the restart of the program for the legacy BRE properties. Our renovations team completed over 1,000 apartment home renovations during the third quarter, an increase of 50% compared to the third quarter of 2014. A little over 30% of the unit renovations are currently focused on the legacy BRE portfolio, which negatively impacted occupancy during the quarter. <br/>We continue to make progress on our merger integration Phase II and Phase III as outlined in the June NAREIT presentation available on our website. The Resource Management efforts, renovation, and refinement of the Revenue Management Unit  amenity pricing are ongoing efforts that will continue for the foreseeable future. We're making good progress on Phase III which is focused on improving our customer experience, growing our employees, and increasing our efficiency, the results of which will be realized after 2016. Now, I will share some highlights for each region, beginning with Southern  California. <br/>Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego continue to be strong performers this quarter driven by job growth of 2.3%, 3.3%, and 3.2% respectively, all exceeding our initial expectations and US averages. Personal income growth continues to grow well above the national average in all three metros. Northern California continues to perform above expectations due to exceptional job growth in San Francisco and San Jose which was reported for September at 4.6% and 5.5% respectively. The robust personal income growth in the Bay Area forecasted to be 4.6% in San Francisco and 6.5% in San Jose is enabling the strong market rent growth with a limited impact on affordability. <br/>Oakland continues to perform well due to its strong income and job growth, as well as its proximity to both San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Uber purchased Uptown Station in downtown Oakland and was expected to accommodate 2,500 to 3,000 employees beginning in 2017. Several other tech companies are following Uber's path having announced that they are moving or expanding to Oakland to take advantage of the lower cost office space and shorter commutes for their employees, a trend that we expect to continue over the next several years. <br/>The exceptional demand in the Bay Area is evident by the strength of our lease ups. One South Market in downtown San Jose has averaged over 40 leases per month, Epic has averaged about 39 leases per month, and MB360 Phase II in San Francisco, which is close to being rebuilt following the tragic fire in March 2014, is already 26% pre-leased with the first move-in scheduled for the fourth quarter of this year upon completion. <br/>Finally, in Seattle, the employment growth in this region continues to be strong at 3.3%, and personal incomes are expected to grow 5.7% for 2015, maintaining rental market affordability. CBD Seattle continued to perform with revenue growth about 4% quarter-over-quarter while the other markets, Eastside, Snohomish, and South King grew at approximately 8% quarter-over-quarter; 25% of the 6 million square feet of office development in the region is being delivered into downtown Bellevue with the first tower expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Sales force has announced that it signed a lease for 75,000 square feet in Bellevue and it plans to double its current workforce in the area. <br/><br/>We expect housing supply to decline slightly in 2016 as rising construction costs begin to limit apartment development. We are very pleased with our results year-to-date and I think our momentum should position us well into 2016. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angela Kleiman</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> Thank you, John. Today, I'll discuss our third quarter results, the revised outlook for the year, and provide an update on our balance sheet. For the third quarter, we exceeded the mid point of our core FFO guidance by $0.06 per share. $0.03 of the outperformance resulted from higher revenue primarily driven by the strong job growth in our markets which accelerated the rate of lease-up absorption at higher than projected rents. $0.02 of the outperformance resulted from lower expenses within our consolidated properties, although part of the favorable expense variance is timing related; therefore, we expect our year-over-year same property operating expense growth to be between 3% to 4% for the combined portfolio in the fourth quarter. Following two previous revenue guidance increases totaling 115 basis points at the midpoint, we are reaffirming our same-store revenue growth forecast and are pleased to report that we are currently tracking slightly above the midpoint of that range. <br/>Now, turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our net debt to EBITDA has now declined to 6.1 times, which is one-quarter ahead of our target due to stronger-than-anticipated growth in EBITDA. Based on our market rent growth outlook, we expect this metric to decline to the high 5s in 2016. In addition, we are currently evaluating our options to refinance $140 million of Fannie Mae credit-enhanced bonds in the fourth quarter. In doing so, we anticipate potential savings of $1.4 million annually over the seven-year term and we would incur approximately $6 million in writeoffs of which $4.25 million is non-cash. These costs would be excluded from core FFO, but included in total FFO, and are shown as non-core adjustments on S14 in the supplemental. <br/>As for our plans for the $350 million debt maturity in 2016, we have good flexibility with access to multiple options. For example, our $1 billion revolver has virtually no outstanding, and if we leave this debt floating, our variable rate debt exposure will only increase to approximately 10% on a low leverage balance sheet. Although this is not our preference, if we were making this decision today, we favor refinancing most of the maturing debt with a 5- to 7-year term loan and/or a 10-year unsecured public bond execution depending on the interest rate curve and the related threat. <br/>Lastly, we have classified one property as held for sale, our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, which we expect to sell in the fourth quarter. We will be moving to a newly leased space in San Mateo. We're presenting the final steps in the office relocation plans which will consolidate the BRE corporate office in San Francisco with the Essex corporate office in Palo Alto. I'll now turn the call back to the operator for questions. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> We'll now take your questions. <br/>(Operator Instructions) <br/>Nick Joseph of Citi. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Joseph</emphasis> (Analyst - Citigroup): <br/> Thanks. Wondering if you can frame the 7% loss to lease in historical context? You mentioned last year it was 5%, but is this the largest loss to lease you've seen at the end of September? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Nick, hi. It's Mike Schall. I don't have that statistic going back each year historically for a long time, but I know that as of July, that typically is the high point of loss to lease as you go through the year and the low point is in December, so July 2014 was 8%, July 2015 was 8%, the low point was December, so December 2013 was around 4% and -- or I'm sorry, December 2014 was about 4% and 2013 was about 4%, so it gives you some idea. Those are obviously during very strong periods of time. I've seen loss to lease at zero at the end of December and at 5% to 6% I would guess is probably the more normal high for loss to lease in a typical year. Again, these are from my view extraordinary years and that metric I think at 8% in July is near the strongest that we've seen it historically in my 30 -- almost 30-year career. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Joseph</emphasis> (Analyst - Citigroup): <br/> Thanks. And just staying with that, the 6% economic rent growth outlook for next year is actually higher than the 5.6% you had predicted at the same time last year. So what gives you the confidence to make that prediction today?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Well a couple things. If you go back to our original guidance that you noted for 2015, it was based on 2.5% job growth and we are tracking using September year-to-date numbers at 3.3%, so we pretty dramatically outperformed that number. And so we're carrying momentum into this next year, and our view is you add limited amounts of supply -- in other words as the supply/demand relationship is moving in your favor you will build pricing power, so there's a little bit of an incremental pricing power just from the supply/demand situation and the consequent impacts on market occupancy levels in the place where people want to live most. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Joseph</emphasis> (Analyst - Citigroup): <br/> Thanks. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Next we'll hear from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Austin Wurschmidt</emphasis> (Analyst - KeyBanc): <br/> Hi guys it's Austin Wurschmidt here with Jordan. You commented conditions were as strong as they were last year. Is it conceivable to think that you'd be able to push rents at a pace that was higher than what you achieved this year? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Again, this is Michael Schall. I would just go back to the job question and if we exceed the 2.5% job growth that is the basis for our 6% market rent growth then I'd say yes, again we will exceed it once again. We are concerned about affordability. We are concerned about all of the issues with the global economy that were noted before. Although one compelling factor is the personal income growth that we're seeing, especially in the tech markets which is in the 5% to 6% range. So if you're getting 5% to 6% personal income growth and rents are, let's say, growing at 8% or 9%, it doesn't have that big of impact on affordability and again not everyone is going to get the big increase in income. <br/>The personal income growth is driven largely by people, the new tech worker coming in making a lot of money and displacing someone that is not getting a big increase in their compensation who is then forced to move to a place that's farther away from the employment center. So, this transition is ongoing through the renter pool, but if we bring in high income tech workers in greater numbers than we have projected on S16 then, yes, we would expect rent growth to be higher. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Austin Wurschmidt</emphasis> (Analyst - KeyBanc): <br/> Thanks for the detail there. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks also about a decline in housing supply in 2016. I was wondering if you could expand on that a bit and give a little bit of detail by market? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> I don't think that we actually have much of a decline in supply, so I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to. I think that it's very nominal. Who has those numbers? Let's see, 2015 versus 2016. I think the supply decrease is somewhere around like 0.1%, so overall -- so we are not expecting supply to decrease. But, again, we don't have complete certainty. We have some factors that would lead us to believe that supply could decrease, i.e., construction costs going up at 10% in each of the last two years, and John Eudy is here and he's looking for development deals every day and he's having trouble with the underwriting because costs have moved so quickly and pro formas sometimes don't reflect the most current cost structure. So when John and I talk about new deals, we're finding it more difficult for us to underwrite and if we're having trouble underwriting them, I can pretty much assure you others are having trouble as well. John do I have that right? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Eudy</emphasis> (EVP Development): <br/> Yes. Right on. With these actions we are seeing, cities are getting tougher in their requirements. Nothing is going in the favor of over supplying the market. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Austin Wurschmidt</emphasis> (Analyst - KeyBanc): <br/> Thanks. And then just on your comments there about the aggressive bidding going on for new deals. You mentioned being a net seller next year by a little bit. Are there any markets that you're looking to lighten up in and how should we think about the assets that you're typing this hour? Are these are more BRE assets or are they legacy Essex assets? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Yes, just to be clear, I don't think that we'll be a net seller next year, but I don't have complete clarity on that. I think what I said was we will likely sell more next year than we sold this year and so to be clear, the way we look at this is there are two sides of this coin. One is what's going on, on the capital side. In other words, what's the relationship between where REIT stocks are valued and the private real estate markets. Is there a disparity there between the two, and if REIT stocks are trading at an evaluation above where private real estate markets are, then we want to be buying real estate. And the flip we want to be selling real estate and our is view is that we're currently somewhere around parity, which means we call the portfolio, so that's the capital side. <br/><br/>On the real estate side we have very few assets that we put into the two bottom categories, the two categories we're most motivated to sell which are substandard operating properties and marginal properties that's trading like good properties for whatever reason that people are forced to take substandard properties, but we don't believe when the economy changes that they will be the beneficiary. So, those are the calling assets, and then the other categories of property that we are more interested in selling again if this relationship between REIT stock values and private real estate values is appropriate would be the properties that have some other maybe some minor physical or operational impairments and/or the properties that we consider to be market performers, but about half our portfolio just by way of background we consider to be within the in irreplaceable category which we're unlikely to sell almost at any price. So we have a ranking process that ranks the properties in terms of our desirability of sale again within the constraints of how we look at the capital side, and that's how we run our disposition function. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Austin Wurschmidt</emphasis> (Analyst - KeyBanc): <br/> Thank you for the clarification and the details. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Next we'll hear from Dan Oppenheim of Zelman &amp; Associates. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dan Oppenheim</emphasis> (Analyst - Zelman &amp; Associates): <br/> Thanks very much. Was wondering related to the dispositions, would you have more of an emphasis on the pre-1995 community where there would be subject to rent control if they were to be passed in those municipalities? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Hi, Dan. It's Mike Schall again. It comes up as a consideration but I don't think it's one of the key considerations primarily because of California state law. Again, in California state law there's vacancy decontrols mandated, so even though you may have rent control upon move out, you're moving people to market at that point in time, we operate in several rent control cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, and so I don't think that that would necessarily change things. <br/>Our experience in San Francisco, for example, in our rent controlled buildings in San Francisco is that fewer people move out so your turnover rates are lower which means you can't capture the loss to lease as quickly and you'd think that might be a real problem but the flip of that is there are people that otherwise would have moved out of that building if not for the subsidy and bought a home or moved somewhere else and those people now are occupying a unit which effectively makes the availability of units that are vacating smaller and giving us more pricing power on the other side. So, again, rent control cities are not necessarily horrible for us as long as state law remains in place. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dan Oppenheim</emphasis> (Analyst - Zelman &amp; Associates): <br/> Got it. Okay. Thanks. And other question, wondering about the magnitude of the rent increases and the turnover which clearly was down year-over-year, but just wondering in some of the areas with Santa Clara, San Jose where you've seen the higher levels of rent growth, are you also seeing more move outs on account of those rent increases or it actually is lower based on the strong income growth in those markets so that it's not necessarily a function of the rent growth but it's more the income growth that is driving it so that those rent increases aren't an issue? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Erik Alexander</emphasis> (SVP of Operations): <br/> Yes, this is Erik. I would say no that we haven't seen a significant increase due to financial reasons. If you look back over the last couple of years, that number has bounced around between 15% and 18% as people are citing financial reasons, and so that's where it is today as well. The one caveat is that there has been some uptick in people citing relocation out of the area as a reason and we believe that some of that is probably related to financial reasons but, again, that hasn't moved enough for me to believe that it's significant. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dan Oppenheim</emphasis> (Analyst - Zelman &amp; Associates): <br/> Thanks very much. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Alexander Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alexander Goldfarb</emphasis> (Analyst - Sandler O'Neill): <br/> Good afternoon or I guess good morning out there. Angela, welcome to the hot seat. Just quickly a few questions here. The first one, Mike, is you said that you were considering increasing dispositions for next year. If we look going back, you guys have harvested some of your funds over time, unloading of meaningful parts of the portfolio. There's also a focus I think of Essex to always grow FFO, so would you guys ever contemplate a transaction where if you thought that the pricing was so dramatic that you could get to do a sale of properties that would result in earnings coming down because you sold a significant part even though you may generate huge gains for shareholders or the view is always pruned in smaller amounts and leave the larger portfolio stuff to your joint ventures?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Yes, Alex, good question. No, I think if there's a compelling opportunity to sell assets and distribute to a special dividend I think we would absolutely do that. Again, right now we're in this what I just described as sort of the parity phase on the capital side where the stock obviously is bouncing all over the place, so maybe in and out of parity, but we're at that point where there's no compelling arbitrage between the REIT stock price and the private real estate values, and so our motivation in that environment is not as great as it would be if let's say share prices and private real estate values diverge again as they have over the last several years. <br/>So there is some concern about whether people will remember -- whether investors will remember that we paid a special dividend and that will properly get factored into our track record, but that's a relatively minor concern and since that is the only reality with respect to selling assets with large gains and distributing money, you obviously can use a 1031 exchange, but if that's a reality and that's the right thing to do then we're going to do it. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alexander Goldfarb</emphasis> (Analyst - Sandler O'Neill): <br/> Okay. And then switching to Oakland. Last cycle you guys did some investments over there, there is a high rise tower that you guys got involved in, and then if memory serves I thought you guys exited the market or weren't as maybe pleased with the results that you got, but at the beginning of the call you guys spoke highly of the market as far as just the accessibility to San Francisco and the low cost options. So, is this a market that we should see you guys increasingly invest in or is it still maybe attractive right now, you may be hesitant to put longer term rates there? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Yes, I think there's maybe a little definitional issue here. The City of Oakland is different from the Oakland Metro. The Oakland Metro includes Freemont and Pleasanton and Walnut Creek, et cetera. And so we're seeing that the Oakland Metro, which is what generated the 12.7% same-store revenue growth is the broader metro and there are places within that metro that are very high quality and are accessible to San Francisco and some of the major job hubs. <br/>The one thing the Bay Area really got right was the Bay Area rapid transit district which essentially has trains that go from a variety of locations into San Francisco and many, many people including myself, I live in Freemont which is in the Oakland MSA, and getting to San Francisco is a heck of a lot easier than driving. So, it's the one thing I think they got very right, so there are locations within the Oakland Metro area that we think are high quality, commutable into San Francisco, et cetera. We also believe, as John said, that as costs on the office side increase that some employers will start looking at different options that will benefit some of the other metros, including downtown Oakland in this case, but I wouldn't limit it to just downtown Oakland. There could be some businesses or some parts of businesses that will move up and down the coast and/or potentially other markets as well as the cost of business increases. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alexander Goldfarb</emphasis> (Analyst - Sandler O'Neill): <br/> So is downtown Oakland is that something you may revisit or right now it's not on the radar? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> To be clear just downtown Oakland, we have a high rise building that we built down the street from the one you're referring to and I don't think that we're looking at anything else in downtown Oakland. It has to be so specific because there's some areas of downtown Oakland that we really, really don't like and so we would avoid them, but we would be highly, highly selective in Oakland, maybe less so at some of the other locations within the Oakland metro, the broader metro. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alexander Goldfarb</emphasis> (Analyst - Sandler O'Neill): <br/> Okay. Thanks, Mike. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Thanks. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Next we'll hear from Tom Lesnick of Capital One Securities. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tom Lesnick</emphasis> (Analyst - Capital One Securities): <br/> Hi, guys. Just quickly on the same-store guidance range. Obviously on the full 43,000 units the ranges were unchanged, but on the 28,000 units OpEx was revised lower, kind of implying that on the BRE portfolio there was a revision higher and hence the range was unchanged. I was just wondering what was driving that.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angela Kleiman</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> It's not because of that. We revised the Essex same-store because we have realized the savings from the first quarter and we have not revised it for the combined portfolio because we're still waiting on primarily the taxes. As you know, that's the biggest component of expenses. We've only received 75% of the taxes from the BRE acquisition and so although that has come in slightly favorable, there's still a quarter left and so we're just waiting on that first before we make any decisions. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tom Lesnick</emphasis> (Analyst - Capital One Securities): <br/> Makes sense. That's helpful. And then on the insurance reimbursement accounting. I saw there was about $3.1 million on the income statement and then call it 1.8 was backed out for FFO and then another call it 600 was backed out for core, implying that there was a piece in there that was considered core, could you clarify what that was? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angela Kleiman</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> Yes, yes, happy to, and we did move the geography a little bit this quarter and so but the net-net is it's all non-core, and we added a line in our, I think it's in the S or the supplementals, S-2, that shows insurance reimbursements and so there were -- because of that we did a prior period adjustment, so it looks like some ended up in core but if you want, we can talk after the call and I can walk you through the math. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tom Lesnick</emphasis> (Analyst - Capital One Securities): <br/> Sure, happy to follow up on that. And then quickly, what was the recurring CapEx number for the quarter? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angela Kleiman</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> The recurring CapEx is about $18 million for the quarter and you'll see that in our Q3 that's coming out next week. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tom Lesnick</emphasis> (Analyst - Capital One Securities): <br/> All right great. Thank you very much. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Next we'll hear from [Greg Van Winkle], Morgan Stanley . <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Greg Van Winkle</emphasis> (Analyst - Morgan Stanley): <br/> Hey, guys. Going back to your market forecast in the last phase of your supplement. You talked about how job growth versus supply growth still looks really good in all your markets which is leading to the strong rent growth forecast for 2016. If you had to think about the risk though and where you might be wrong, where are you the least certain about your projections and are there any of those markets or forecasts where you think are more at risk than others, whether it be through the upside or the downside? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Hi, this is Mike. That's a good question. We think about risk in really two different ways. One is the risk that in a major economic blip it seems like all the job growth across the nation goes to zero and so the market with the highest overhang of new construction as a percentage of stock is the greatest hit, so Seattle from that perspective at 1.3% has the most overhang with respect to deliveries potentially in an environment again of demand or job growth close to zero across the nation it would have the greatest impact. <br/>In terms of the supply side of the equation, we expect to do enough diligence to have a very high degree of confidence that the supply numbers in this document are accurate. The one piece is you can throw up or build single-family homes relatively quickly if you can entitle them whereas the apartments and condos it takes a very long lead time and it takes a couple years to build those buildings, so we should be able to get them 100% right. So we feel very confident as it relates to the supply estimates which leaves us with of course the job forecast and on this obviously no one has the right answer. None of us have a crystal ball. We try to take a middle-of-the-road type of approach and maybe with an element of conservatism and again last year if you look at how we approach the same document we were pretty conservative. This year we're not estimating that. We're going to continue with this incredible job growth that we've had in 2015. <br/>We moderated it somewhat, but the reality is we don't know. We think this is our expected case scenario so therefore we expect the West Coast coastal metros to outperform the nation, the nation at 2% by what is that, around 20%-25% and I think that's a rational relationship over a longer period of time, so we put this as maybe it tends to be a little bit conservative and we hope to outperform it, but we view it as essentially a balanced forecast and I think the risks are really the economy and what happens with the economy because that is going to drive whether we hit these job growth forecasts and whether the nation hits its job growth forecasts and then would you rank these and say Seattle would be the greatest exposure if you had to put the major economic issue.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Greg Van Winkle</emphasis> (Analyst - Morgan Stanley): <br/> Okay, and absent any nationwide economic slowdown there aren't any three major geographies for you that are more or less at risk in the job growth side just from kind of market specific issues? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Well, southern California is a more diverse economy so you would say the chances are that if you're going to have widespread dislocation in southern California it has to come from a variety of sectors. Obviously we have more tech focus in northern California and Seattle, so you would say if something happens to technology, you have a somewhat greater exposure there just as it relates to the components that are driving the economy. And I'd say the same is true of all of this divergence within the economy where certain sectors are doing really well and others are doing poorly. Look at what happened with energy, for example. Anything that has a greater concentration of any part of the economy I guess potentially is more exposed. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Greg Van Winkle</emphasis> (Analyst - Morgan Stanley): <br/> Makes total sense. And then last one here. If we think about upside from redevelopment and also optimizing lease expirations in the BRE portfolio, how much of a tail wind do you think that could be to same-store revenue growth in 2016? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Eudy</emphasis> (EVP Development): <br/> This is John. On the BRE on the renovation side we will probably add about 50 basis points to their growth rate toward the second half of 2016. It will still take a little while to ramp up and have the impact at the bottom line. As it relates to hitting the expirations in better order and the amenity [crises] in better order, that's an ongoing process. That took us several years for the revenue management team. They worked very hard to make adjustments in the system for the Essex assets and we see that continuing on for the next couple of years. I can't quite quantify the impact other than to say as Erik had mentioned earlier we had some issues earlier on this year because of the expirations and it's not as simple as just solving it at that point in time as most people in the marketplace want a standard 12-month lease, and so by trying to force a new expiration schedule you don't necessarily get the best results so you solve that type of a problem through a couple of rentals [innovations] in just a few years. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Greg Van Winkle</emphasis> (Analyst - Morgan Stanley): <br/> Alright, that's great. Thanks, guys. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Next we'll hear from Drew Babin of Robert W. Baird. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Drew Babin</emphasis> (Analyst - Robert W. Baird): <br/> Hi. Great quarter. Looking into next year in the BRE portfolio integration in terms of your expense line items, any visibility at this point on which line items we may see kind of shift one direction or the other as the different cost savings initiatives take deeper effect and also kind of what G&amp;A run rate expectation is the same factors? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Eudy</emphasis> (EVP Development): <br/> Yes, this is John again. I'll be careful not to get into forward guidance but just to give some flavor. Right now Erik worked very hard when he first looked over the portfolio and we ultimately have our expenses with BRE expected on a unit per unit basis pretty close, so from a go-forward basis we don't expect large changes that relate to one portfolio or the other. We are working, as we mentioned on our Phase III merger integration which includes procurement, and we do expect to see some savings there. We don't have our hands around all of that at this point in time. <br/>We also have benefit of Resource Management, as we mentioned previously, and that is really largely focused on the BRE portfolio. We expect it from the onset to save as much as $100 a unit in utilities as we implement that. That's pretty tedious. It takes several years to implement each of the programs and do it well, so that will work its way into the BRE portfolio over say a three-year period, some of which we've already completed. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Drew Babin</emphasis> (Analyst - Robert W. Baird): <br/> And any impacts noticeably on the G&amp;A front with the office consolidation? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angela Kleiman</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> We are in the process of rolling up our 2015 budget and so on the office front -- let's put it this way. I think G&amp;A as a whole probably would expect a modest increase, but it's not going to be materially different from what we're seeing right now.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> I think there will be a little bit of a geography difference because we'll take the proceeds from the sale of the office building and reinvest them and that will offset some of the G&amp;A that will come in from the office relocation. So we expect the net core FFO impact to be modest, but the geography will be a little different. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Drew Babin</emphasis> (Analyst - Robert W. Baird): <br/> Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Wes? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Wes, if you can release your mute function, we are unable to hear you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wes Golladay</emphasis> (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets): <br/> Sorry about that. Good quarter, everyone. Real quick on the job forecast, how did you derive that? Was that a third party or are you looking at individual office leasing data that you're seeing and coming up with your own forecast and how granular does it get? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> This is Mike, Wes. We use a variety of data vendors, economy.com, [Roesen], a variety of others and so we try to build a consensus as to the US job growth and from there we look at historical relationships of if the US is doing this what is the likely impact on the West Coast and our metros and we have given consideration to specific sectors. So it isn't granular in the sense of we've got an estimate for what's happened at HP, but it starts with the broader macro expectations for the US and then it looks through to the sectors and tries to predict what is going to happen, and then of course we take that information and we create a supply/demand model for our each of our metros, our 25 some-odd sub markets and then we rank them from the perspective of what we expect rents to do over the next four years and that's how we make our capital allocation decisions. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wes Golladay</emphasis> (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets): <br/> Okay. And then you mentioned more about rent control this quarter as well. Quick question for you on that. How much of your tenant base is that customer that you don't want to displace the teacher, the police officer versus the tech workforce which is growing their income faster than you're growing the rent? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> This is going to be completely anecdotal, but I think that it's a significant part of our renter base. I'm guessing in northern California, Seattle, it's somewhere in the 40% range, 30% to 40% range and, again, those people -- this is an ongoing process. Essentially people coming in making a lot of money, able to rent that expensive unit and displacing someone that doesn't get a huge increase in compensation and they move to next rung out let's say, and so it's hard to tell. I mean we've seen this play out many times in the Bay Area. It's not nearly to the extent that I saw in 1999 and 2000. This went on maybe three or four more years and therefore that transitionary effect continues to happen, but it's not limited by any means to California or San Francisco. Look what goes on in New York City, for example. So this is the ordinary operation of the renter pool and incentivizing the people that make the most money and therefore get the choice of where they want to live, so I view it as entirely again normal part of the marketplace, although I do believe that California would benefit itself and the employers and the whole economy if it would find a way to produce more housing. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wes Golladay</emphasis> (Analyst - RBC Capital Markets): <br/> Okay, thanks a lot. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Next we'll hear from Nick Yulico of UBS. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Yulico</emphasis> (Analyst - UBS): <br/> Thanks. Mike, being that you sit in Palo Alto, the heart of venture capital land, I was wondering what you're sort of hearing from people on that end about there's been some data showing venture capital funding, number of deals coming down for startups? Are you looking at that as a leading indicator for the economy out there and what is your take on this discussion of late? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Yes, it's a good question and we are somewhat concerned about venture capital and we do track it. We're less concerned about the valuations and whether there's an exit into the public markets and liquidity as it relates to those entities. We're more concerned about how many people do they have, how many employees do they have, how many people need housing, and in that light I can't stress how different the current environment is from the internet boom in the late 90s. <br/><br/>If you take the top 20 unicorns, for example, I believe that they employ somewhere around 26,000 people. If you take five public companies, Oracle , Apple , Cisco , Google , Facebook , they employ 367,000 people. We are obviously much more concerned about the big tech companies and what they are doing and it's amazing. We're looking at what, for example, Google's doing with the alphabet companies and all of the different technology-related spinoff and combined with the fact that they have an enormous amount of capital to deploy into those entities gives us some comfort that tech hiring is not going to fall off a cliff here and, in fact, that's why we feel pretty comfortable with our expectations on S16 and our market outlook because it seems like there's a lot of activity out here and there's a lot of money out here that's pursuing that activity both DC some of just the major corporate entities. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Yulico</emphasis> (Analyst - UBS): <br/> Alright. Good points. I guess turning down to Hollywood. The Nickelodeon site you guys have, can you just remind us what's the sort of ultimate cost on that project and a little bit more about where you think the land value is today because there's a lot of sites trading around there recently or on the market right now for sale and then just lastly, I want to be clear, whether or not that site is actually listed in your land held for development or if it's still some other piece of real estate because at one point there was a lease on it? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Eudy</emphasis> (EVP Development): <br/> This is John Eudy. In general, you're where specific location in Hollywood I would assume, it is a ground zero core Hollywood location. There have been a number of other transactions in the Hollywood address area that are completely different. As far as it being listed as a future still as an investment I believe, is that correct, Angela, the Hollywood asset is as an investment because we leased with Nickelodeon? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Angela Kleiman</emphasis> (CFO): <br/> Yes. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Eudy</emphasis> (EVP Development): <br/> In terms of our basis, we believe well below what we would be able to trade it for today if we chose to go in that direction and we are under the radar in terms of the height of the building that we're going offer and less visibility in terms of pushback on the entitlement side, so long and short is we expect some time late next year is when we would transfer it over to a leased investment to an active land development transaction. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Yulico</emphasis> (Analyst - UBS): <br/> Okay. I guess just -- that's helpful, but anything more you could tell us on just sort of the ultimate how to think about FAR and because there dare -- I know we can look at land comps in the market, but some idea about how much you could actually build on that site? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">John Eudy</emphasis> (EVP Development): <br/> Approximately 200 units is what we're going for and it fits within the FAR fairly nicely. Until we get it all done, we don't like to do a lot of projecting and assumptions until we're ready to announce. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nick Yulico</emphasis> (Analyst - UBS): <br/> Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Thank you. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> Our final question today comes from [Conor Wagner] of Green Street Advisors. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Conor Wagner</emphasis> (Analyst - Green Street Advisors): <br/> How meaningful a factor are below-market taxes due to Prop 13 in ranking your potential dispositions for next year? <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Hi, Conor. It's Mike Schall. It is a factor and Prop 13 gives us a fair amount of wind to our back relative to what buyers will have to pay if they purchase an asset and so I'd say number one it's a factor. Number two, we are looking for a variety of different transactional approaches to avoid a Prop 13 reassessment, so it could involve selling less than half, 49%, of a portfolio of assets, for example, to an institutional investor. So there are some ways to manage that, we believe, but management of Prop 13 is a factor for sure. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Conor Wagner</emphasis> (Analyst - Green Street Advisors): <br/> And then on the dispositions for next year, is there any thought to condo yet or is it still too early?<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> I think it's still a bit too early. Again, we can only pull that trigger one time and so we targeted a 30% to 40% premium to apartment values in order to make it worthwhile to convert from an apartment to a condo, and we're not seeing that 30% to 40% premium anywhere, although in San Francisco and actually a couple of the other Bay Area cities we're starting to see 10% to 15% premiums of condo values over apartments so we're starting to see that divergence. It has taken longer, not necessarily because condos have done poorly but because apartments have done so well. So we continue to monitor it. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Conor Wagner</emphasis> (Analyst - Green Street Advisors): <br/> Great. Thank you very much. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Thanks, Conor. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> And there are no further questions at this time <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Michael Schall</emphasis> (President &amp; CEO): <br/> Thank you. Well, in closing I want to thank you once again for joining the call. We wish you and your families a safe and enjoyable Halloween and look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in a few weeks. Good day. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Operator</emphasis>: <br/> That does conclude today's conference. <br/>All rights reserved (c) 2014 TheStreet, Inc.<br/>Please feel free to quote up to 200 words per transcript.

Thank you for joining us today.  I'm David Lashway, and I lead Baker McKenzie's cyber-security global practice.  Delighted to have you all with us today.  </p><p> Good morning, Madam President.  Thank you for joining us.  Damon Wilson and the folks from the Atlantic Council, thank you for hosting today with us.  Jim Schiutto from CNN is here, as well, and will be carrying the day in the discussions later this morning.  So thank you all.</p><p> Distinguished guests -- Mr. Chertoff, thank you for being here.  It's good to see you and some old friends, Chris Boehner (ph) and others from the State Department.  Thank you for joining us today.</p><p> Yesterday, Madam President, while at the White House, you reminded us of the blue, black and white of your flag and that you will always remember that it flew in -- here in America when it could not fly in Estonia, during 50 years of the 100 years that we celebrate during your visit today, due to occupation.</p><p> You reminded us, as well, of our partnership to confront challenges, and that that partnership is based upon three common things:  one, an understanding; two, the rule of law; and three, and perhaps most importantly, common beliefs.  You said that we form the axis of the good based upon these.</p><p> We are proud to fly the blue, black and white of your flag here today, and we welcome you to the discussion to advance our common beliefs and understanding around cyber-security and other security risks, both in Estonia, in Europe more generally and here in the United States.  </p><p> Marie Under, perhaps the most notable 20th-century Estonian poet, who lived during Soviet occupation and wrote of her experience, in her famous poem, \"Night,\" wrote, \"And, hand in hand, we walk uphill together.\"  </p><p> I hope that, through the discussion today, we will go hand in hand through this discussion and through what will confront us in cyber in the days ahead.</p><p> And, finally, as we were just discussing this morning and as you mentioned yesterday, you reminded us Americans to reflect on the words that are carved in the granite monuments around our mall.  That caused me to pause this morning and think for a moment of all the different statements that are carved across the mall that we look out on today.  </p><p> And, on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death, no statement came to mind more than this -- perhaps one of the great American poets in Mr. King:  \"If we are to have peace on Earth,\" he said, \"our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class and our nation, and this makes us better.  And, in common, we must develop a world perspective.\"</p><p> Thank you for sharing your perspective today.  Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to the discussion.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> PAVEL:  Good morning, and welcome, everyone.  I'm Barry Pavel.  I'm a senior vice president at the Atlantic Council, and I direct the Scowcroft Center on -- on Strategy and Security there.  </p><p> On behalf of the council, I'm really honored to -- to welcome you to our conversation with -- with President Kaljulaid of the Republic of Estonia, especially since this is her first public event here in Washington, D.C.  And, Madam President, thank you so much for being -- for being here with us.  </p><p> Again, I'd also like to welcome those of you who are following the webcast online.  Please feel free to join the conversation on Twitter, using the hashtag #USBalticSummit, and the account @cyberstatecraft.</p><p> In today's discussion, we'll be touching on issues that -- that, in my view, will be key to the decade unfolding ahead of us, and those issues include artificial intelligence, blockchain and cyber-security, all matters on which President Kaljulaid has a strong voice and leadership, particularly given her presidency of a country undertaking what the New Yorker has called \"the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today.\" PAVEL:  Estonia has been at the cutting edge of the digital revolution since well before most of us were actually calling it a revolution.</p><p> By the late 1990s, all of Estonia's schools were online.  And since then, it's gone digital on all its government services and set up data embassies outside the country to safeguard that information.</p><p> That's the kind of cyber foresight that we could use more of.  And that's why we're so proud to have President Kaljulaid with us today.</p><p> At the Atlantic Council, we've redoubled our efforts toward fostering an international community of like-minded states and reinvigorating an adaptive set of global norms and rules built on common principles such as openness, transparency and the rule of law.  Sometimes we do that the old-fashioned way through diplomacy and summits, but we're also passionate about innovating wherever useful and needed.</p><p>Estonia's project of digital statecraft, or e-Estonia, perfectly mirrors that spirit of much-needed innovation.  By leveraging technology to transform everything from voting to citizenship, Estonia has shown us how to bring these tried and tested values forward into this century.</p><p> But of course introducing a digital -- digital element to governance also introduces risks, as Estonia itself knows very well from the cyber attacks of 2007.  The very freedom and connectivity that makes our societies what they are, also opens us to malicious activities undertaken by those who oppose our values, as Lieutenant General McMaster outlined so passionately and eloquently before some of us at the Atlantic Council last evening in his final public remarks as national security advisor.</p><p>Estonia used the -- Estonia used the 2007 attack to turn its vulnerabilities into strengths, and it's now widely considered a global leader on cyber-security, with Tallinn hosting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.</p><p> But it underscores the need for us to devote real resources to protecting our increasingly information-based societies.  And though we are already doing much to safeguard ourselves, as General McMaster said, much more work remains to be done on all fronts and in very close coordination with our allies.</p><p> And that's why at the Scowcroft Center we devote so many sustained efforts to strengthening cyber statecraft, working closely with key allies in every region of the world.  And that's why we organize teams to visit the Baltics -- as we are doing next week, for example -- to engage more directly with our allies, to help shore up deterrence, defense and resilience against the foremost security challenges that we face.</p><p> And with that, let me introduce President Kaljulaid and our moderator, Jim Sciutto, to -- to speak to both the promise and peril of digital statecraft.</p><p> Before becoming the president of Estonia in 2016, President Kaljulaid served as a member of the European Court of Auditors from 2004 to 2016, where she organized the financial audit of E.U. R&amp;amp;D funds, among many other leading responsibilities.  She also was the economic adviser to the prime minister from 1999 to 2002, as well as CFO and CEO of the IRU power plant.</p><p> Leading our discussion today will be Jim Sciutto, chief national security correspondent of CNN; most importantly, a Villanova fan, for those of us from that area.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> With his extensive experience reporting overseas across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, we couldn't have asked for a better guide for this conversation.</p><p> He was the only American journalist to embed with U.S. special forces during the Iraq invasion, and he has reported undercover from inside Myanmar, and he reported Iran's first reaction to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union remarks.</p><p> Before we turn to Jim and Kaljulaid, I wanted to thank Baker &amp;amp; McKenzie for hosting us today.</p><p> Thanks very much.</p><p> Thanks David Lashway, partner here at the firm, also for his continuous support of our cyber efforts at the Atlantic Council.</p><p> And now let's get to the good stuff.  Thanks again.  And I'll hand it over to our esteemed panelists.</p><p> Thank you very much.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Thank you for the kind introduction.  Thanks so much to the Atlantic Council, Baker &amp;amp; McKenzie, and -- and thank you, President Kaljulaid, for allowing me to sit across from you and throw a few questions your way.</p><p> I've had -- I've had the good fortune of spending some time in Estonia and interacting with -- with Estonian officials, interviewed foreign minister, as I've covered the Russian story and had some nice visits there as well.  And I feel lucky for that.  In fact, I spent my birthday last year in Estonia.</p><p> And as you know, it just -- it's a remarkable position, I think, in what has become a dominant national security line for the U.S., as a neighbor to Russia, as one of the first victims of a coordinated Russia cyber attack in 2007; really unprecedented but -- but foreshadowing of things to come.</p><p> And yet as a country, doubling down, all-in on the digitized society without hesitation and -- and with full confidence.  And finding their (ph) way forward.  Certainly a lot of lessons to be learned there, I think for -- for Europe for the U.S.</p><p> The subject today, of course, artificial intelligence, et cetera.</p><p> I do want to start, if I can, just in light of your visit here and your time yesterday in the White House, I'm curious, do you have confidence that the U.S. is a solid partner for you as you face challenges from Russia, particular cyber challenges from Russia?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Yes, I have to say I have great confidence in this administration and in American people.  And as I also said yesterday, this confidence is not (inaudible).  It has (inaudible) in this common, shared values (ph) which we all have.  And (inaudible) that, and I think it's pretty obvious that we can have confidence.</p><p> And I have to say that we've had really good cooperation with his administration (ph) since he took office.  (Inaudible).  Also (inaudible) -- for example, on nuclear weapons in 21st century, (inaudible) U.N. Security Council (ph) (inaudible) et cetera.  So the contents are close and (inaudible).  And this gives us confidence (inaudible).  And it doesn't (inaudible).</p><p> SCIUTTO:  If I could start on -- I want to get to artificial intelligence very quickly, but just on cyber, to describe to folks -- one thing that struck me when I was in Estonia is just the frequency of cyber attacks.  This is -- this is a daily event, many times a day.  These are the numbers of the way it works, right?  It doesn't come in -- you know, in pairs or in dozens, it comes constantly.</p><p> How is it today?  And -- and -- and where are the attacks coming from?  How aggressive are they?  And how do you push back?</p><p> KALJULAID:  (Inaudible) just because you can't see this in the United States (inaudible).  (Inaudible) you also have systems where (inaudible) and analyzed (inaudible) we also learned (inaudible) quite a number of them came from Russia (inaudible) Estonia.  And this is how it is.</p><p> In most of the cases you don't allow it (ph).  You just deter and (inaudible) but we don't analyze where it comes from, because they are (inaudible).</p><p> But (inaudible) or in case you see that someone is coming out (ph) (inaudible) systems, they're not (ph) (inaudible) analyze also where they came from. KALJULAID:  But in most of the cases, it simply doesn't give (inaudible) to deem this piece, because (inaudible) anyway and if it will not have a particular reason to -- to try to (inaudible).  Then it just doesn't cooperate.  It's just how cyber works, and I don't that it will ever change.  This is how it is while...</p><p> SCIUTTO:  The outgoing national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, said last night that -- and he's not alone in this.  You've heard this from many members of the administration, but also from folks outside -- that the U.S. and the West have not yet imposed sufficient costs on Russia to deter activity -- and not just cyber activity, other activity -- in Ukraine, et cetera.  Do you agree with that?</p><p> KALJULAID:  I think there is considerable space to improve.  What has (inaudible) and which has come to many peoples' mind is to go off of the Russian money (ph) that don't perceive to go out to something which were very good.  Most of the (inaudible) happened that the discussion was whether or not to throw Russia out of the international money transfer (inaudible), another option, for example, but I think actions need to be proportionate, and meanwhile it's also wise to say that we've been talking as well.</p><p> Talking all of this (inaudible) and understand this one is going to get as well (ph).  (inaudible), this comes from only one source.  This is the unit (ph), and we know that.  We see it.  We observe it very often that, for example, when there are attempts to break off from, let's say, all sanctions on Ukraine, then there is quite clever Russian persons assigned to understand where these attacks are going and trying to use this (inaudible) immediately.</p><p> And I would even say that quite often Russia goes where it thinks that this total (ph) result may be neglecting this part of Europe or region.  I think this happened in Georgia.  I think this happened in Ukraine.  These countries were trying and -- were trying to come closer to Europe for some time, and obviously Europe (inaudible) to provide (inaudible) and clear opportunity and possibilities on how to come (inaudible) members (ph).  So we saw that things went wrong.</p><p> And actually at the same line, in my mind (inaudible).  Maybe there was an understanding that Euro-solidarity is broken because of Brexit.  Now, (inaudible), and this is, of course, where we are as well.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  In the case -- in cases like this, where you have comprehensive and quite damaging cyber attacks, in your view, does Article V apply?</p><p> KALJULAID:  I'm quite sure that also if you read the academic analysis of what cyber might cause and that it can have as devastating consequences to a nation's security as conventional attacks, then I'm quite sure that we can imagine situations where Article V would apply.  But until you have tested, you'll never know.</p><p> On the other hand, you don't want to bring the threshold of calling Article V low, so it will always be a difficult question on how to move forward.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  But that is the Russian strategy, is it not, to pursue activities and attacks that are just below the perceived threshold of a coordinated response?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Yes, but when it becomes dangerous to a country's security and sovereignty, then you know that you have to go and say, \"This is an Article V situation.\"</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Now, did you consider that in 2007?  Because this was quite -- I mean, this was an attack designed to cut Estonia off, right, in effect?</p><p> KALJULAID:  First of all, 2007 attack was in no way dangerous to Estonia's security, because what Estonia was able to do in 2007, it walled off the country.  Inside the country, services was running, so Estonia was not down.  What was down was the external connection to Estonia.</p><p> I was in Luxembourg.  I couldn't access my bank account, but all Estonians in Estonia could and the services were up and running.  So it definitely was not an attack which could -- which could have actually been a risk to this country's security.</p><p> In addition, it wasn't -- it wasn't very effective in -- in attacking the vital systems of the country.  Digital government systems, yes.  But I mean, nobody dies if they are down for two hours.  They were mostly functional and they were just walled off from the rest of the internet world.</p><p> The simple denial of the service attack, which nowadays is very common.  So definitely, that would not have been an Article V case.</p><p> But if you think of the whole 2007 situation, with Russia provoking also -- also while people were fighting on the streets for a couple of nights, et cetera, so you had -- you had a more dire situation than just a cyber attack and you had to see all of these facts together.  That was a cyber attack combined with what else was going on in the country, and that is why the European partners and allies also came out in strong support of Estonia, calling out that this is Russian.</p><p> And this is very important that this call came; that nobody then asked (inaudible) questions, et cetera, probably because they couldn't yet.  I mean, this was not the common thinking then.  Everybody was in shock and awe that cyber attack against a nation can exist at all.</p><p> But nevertheless, the support was -- was -- as we see it today when something like this happens.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  There was a good piece last week, I believe it was by Max Boot, who made the argument that the U.S. and NATO is, in effect, fighting the last war again; making that mistake of fighting the last war.  That in this environment of hybrid warfare like you experienced in 2007 and see elsewhere today, that it's not about buying more littoral combat ships, right?  That you need to focus on the right tools, whether they be offensive cyber weapons, et cetera.</p><p> Do you have a concern that that's the case; that folks are looking backwards as opposed to forwards?  Especially with Estonia that -- that by its very nature looks forward in terms of technology?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Yes.  But first of all, just because you have newer kinds of risks doesn't make the old kind of risks disappear, unfortunately.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  (inaudible).</p><p> KALJULAID:  If it were that, I would be extremely happy and maybe even welcome these new risks which are geographic (ph) in nature, because then, of course, our geopolitical seismic (ph) region will not be anymore geopolitically seismic (ph) because globally we are.</p><p> And it's only partly a joke, but if you think seriously where Russia is ahead of us -- we know that NATO is stronger than Russia.  But if you look at, let's say, eastern border of NATO and conventional capacities, then Russia has considerable might there.</p><p> If you now think that you are -- you are seeing what is happening to our country's economy and technological development, because while Russia is very proud about Ukrainian sanctions and its own counter-sanctions by which Russia doesn't buy agriculture products anymore from European market, that it is now an independent -- well, independently able to feed its own population, then this is wonderful.  You are primary sector exports (ph) and you are great agrarian country, 21st century.</p><p> Something's missing.  Technology's missing.</p><p>Russia is losing out on technology development because of our sanctions big time.  I'm quite sure that if Georgia never happened, Russia would be part of the Horizon 2020 European R&amp;amp;D program, because Georgia, for example, is participating in that program. KALJULAID:  So they must see that they're losing in their might.  I mean, it's not so big country, it's not economically well off, and its prognosis is bad, so -- and you still have some conventional advantages somewhere, globally.</p><p> I think this is particularly the time when you need to be vigilant in your analysis and in your response to be able to deter, if there were to be a sudden attempt to try to turn the tables. </p><p> Therefore, we cannot neglect conventional risks, even if there are new risks.  And I think it's more true today than, maybe, it was, I'd say, 10 years ago.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  You raise a point, which is something of a contrarian point of view here in the U.S., that -- that the perception that Russia is winning is misplaced; that, in fact, they're paying a very high cost in economic terms, technological terms.</p><p> You know, if you -- if you -- you know, to echo, to some degree, as you did, Senator John McCain, Russia's a gas station, right?  You know, the -- the -- you know, it's still basically a petrol economy.  Not great to -- to travel...</p><p> KALJULAID:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  What's that?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well, nowadays, which is fine.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> You have to give a country credit it deserves.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Big picture, do you -- are you making an argument that Russia's losing strategically?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Yes.  Strategically, Russia is losing.  And, therefore, I think we need to take this very seriously -- what their analysis of the situation might be. </p><p> What -- when will the window of opportunity of turning the tables suddenly on us close?  We don't know this.  We don't know what's the analysis, and we don't know, also, on a technical level, when is the moment.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Turning the tables meaning a catastrophic attack meant to...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> KALJULAID:  Something going really wrong, yes.  In conventional sphere, in somewhere else -- something like Salisbury -- I mean, we didn't -- if somebody had told you two months ago that this would happen, would you have thought it's probable?  No.  So I think we need to be very vigilant right now.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Do you -- do you envision that -- again, I'm asking you to predict, which I know that no politician likes to do.  But -- but are you speaking in the cyber sphere?  Are you speaking in the kinetic sphere, or -- could be a whole range?</p><p> KALJULAID:  I'm speaking in cyber sphere.  And I think, Russia aside, we need to think much more seriously how we treat, internationally, the risks stemming from -- from the cyber, and also from the fact that we have more and more self-learning systems.</p><p> And, also, I think we should think about -- that maybe Elon Musk and (inaudible) and others -- that they're right about A.I.  And they put the probability of having A.I. at 50 percent at 2050.  Well, I take this with -- pinch of salt, because I have a degree in genetic engineering.</p><p> And, when I was starting in university in '90s, then, everybody was sure that we would clone people by 2010.  And we are very, very far from that.  So I don't know whether we should take it seriously.  But at least I know this:  that we can create systems which are self-learning and pretty autonomous, looking like A.I. to most people. </p><p> So we should actually understand what new kinds of risks stem from that.  And I particularly love the -- the example of an -- of an -- close-to-A.I. or even A.I. war -- means (ph) somebody's nuclear system -- doesn't matter whose -- it -- this could be the system of an axis of good or an axis of bad.  Doesn't matter, really. </p><p> But imagine you have a war, and it's in somebody's system, and it's self-learning, and we sent it into the system thinking that we know what it will find as equipment (ph) -- the software in that system -- and then it finds something unexpected.  For example, somebody has taken a contaminated computer to the system -- very common thing.  Somebody read (ph) internet on the same computer, then connected it to some technical system.</p><p> And this, our A.I. little war now (ph), reads this information.  And this changes our understanding, because we thought it will only read and learn about the system, but he (ph) read a piece of news.  And this piece of news said that United Nations getting ready to ban A.I. for military use.</p><p> And this system is in the nuclear element, and it knows it is A.I., and it knows the system where it is is military.  What will happen?  And it's not as science fiction as -- as it sounds.  Maybe this particular example still is, but I use it to explain that, I mean, we have loads of things which might come not necessarily from state and government actors. </p><p> Artificial intelligence, as far as we see now, will not be created by a public actor.  It will created, probably, by somebody else.  Where?  We don't know.  When?  We don't know.  We know it hasn't been created, because, according to the current technology development, it would eat so much energy that we would notice that somewhere, globally, energy is being used to this extent.</p><p> But it might happen.  And we are not even discussing about how international law should apply, what should be our measures, counter-measures. </p><p> For example, we could agree, at the United Nations level, that, if we detect that energy somehow being used in a concentrated way somewhere, or that somebody has built a neural-network-like computer network somewhere, this would trigger an inspection. </p><p> Are we discussing it?  No.  We are only discussing the cyber, conventional, and failing even there to agree how exactly international law should apply in cyber sphere.</p><p> I think we are so far behind the curve of where we should be.  And I think this is now urgent discussion which you should be having.  But you don't have many takers, I have to say.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  There's a great quote, and I don't -- I can't quote it from memory, that -- that Putin said at a conference last year about -- the country that controls A.I. will dominate in a number of ways.  And then I often read that quote at speeches, and ask folks who they think said it.  And they always say, \"Elon Musk,\" or something like that.</p><p> It's Putin.  He's clearly thinking in these terms.  Whose -- who, to our knowledge, is ahead on A.I.?  China?  Russia?  The U.S.?  Estonia?</p><p> KALJULAID:  My guess is that it's in private sector, not in government sector right now.  But, indeed, what -- I noticed this quote, and I was very worried. </p><p> Because, normally, President Putin speaks -- he -- in his -- if we look back in retrospective -- I mean, all the discussion about geopolitical catastrophe of breaking down the Soviet Union, thereafter came tries to negotiate, then -- Georgia, et cetera -- sometimes you hear something -- well, we've heard very often, for example, that the Baltic states are very stupid to leave the Russian electricity grid, because, of course, it's very technically stable.</p><p> And the -- which is true, by the way.  It is technically very stable.  Yet, we know that he spent a lot of money to make sure that his structures will not suffer if we are pushed off the grid suddenly.  Right now, this is not still possible, but it is (ph).</p><p> So this makes us to -- work with European Commission to make sure that we could be deconnected (ph) from -- from that grid as quickly as possible and connected to the European electricity grid even if, I mean, economically, it doesn't -- well -- make much sense to do this.  But it's clear that, if you hear these things, you need to think about what that might mean. </p><p> Similarly, there was a call for respect, and then Salisbury.  So, indeed, we need to pay attention that artificial intelligence, if it happens in -- somewhere, then we need to detect it quickly.  We need to detect it quickly, especially in case it will be in the -- on the axis of bad, not on the axis of good.  But my guess is it will be private sector.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  So now I'm going to ask you to predict again.  You said that folks, you know, years ago, predicted we'd already be cloning dogs and cats and human beings, and we're not there yet.  How many years or decades off do you think the breakthrough is? KALJULAID:  I cannot -- I'm not a specialist in that field.  But, looking at -- again, at this benchmark of genetic engineering, then we cannot -- well, we can make bacteria with some characteristics which we wanted it to have; that's all.  And we are eight years past the date we were supposed to clone human beings, so it might take time.</p><p> But this doesn't change the fact that -- I mean, autonomous systems, self-learning autonomous systems can mimic pretty closely something which is A.I.  It will not be a -- a science fiction, but it -- it may be nevertheless as dangerous, or almost as dangerous.  It's just that it's easier to predict what it thinks -- well, \"thinks\" in quotation marks of course.</p><p> But this example what I came about the war (ph) in nuclear system, this doesn't need to be A.I.  It could be actually a -- a well-learning automated system just happening on the wrong piece of information.</p><p> My example was understandable for us, but we are talking machines there. There might be other technical data which is not understandable for us right now here, which will actually push it off the course, and we need to be ready for these kind of developments.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  And -- and self-learning systems like that exist today?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Yes, we have self-learning systems playing really good board games, we know that.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  For a digitized economy like Estonia, which has created, of course, many jobs and opportunities for its population, but of course technology, as we know, often replaces human jobs with -- with machines, et cetera.</p><p> Is -- is the approach of A.I. and -- and the existence of self learning something, you know, a rough equivalence today.  What did that do to the future of work?</p><p> KALJULAID:  I think will do good to the future of work.  First of all, already now we can see that the current mediocre level of technology was what the humankind is able to achieve is changing the work -- work already.</p><p> I mean, the fact that I can work from Tallinn for somebody in America, or in France or in Australia demonstrated people don't need enterprises anymore to get the best added value of their skills.   They don't need broad skills; they can be extremely narrow skills, and -- and they could sell them globally because you can sell them online, which poses a huge question -- who will get the taxes?  And without taxes, we will not -- we will not be able to help our people to pass this transfer.</p><p> Sometimes people think that the nature of the job will change only for well learned and educated people, but I think it is a great equalizing fact (ph), because you can -- you can actually be somebody who would (inaudible) something very classic, like handicraft, but you will be able to sell it globally.</p><p> We have in Estonia this -- this case where is (ph) a South African man living in a small county in middle of nowhere basically in Estonia, and he makes bows and arrows.  They're really good, I've -- I've understood, because they sell globally for a high price.  And -- but he just prefers to live where, I mean, his clients -- the closest client I think was more than 2,000 kilometers away.</p><p> So, an example, and even for handicapped people, let's imagine you have an -- well an autistic person who is ready to knit socks, but only red ones, probably in his vicinity he wouldn't find enough takers, and since he's incapable to socialize, he cannot sell.  But online and globally probably he finds enough, I mean, these people who love just these red socks.  So you can sell and -- and you can have a job.  And previously, such a person would have been unemployed.</p><p> So there are numerous ways of how they -- well the work is changing.  And what I hate most is that let's tax robots and pay subsistence fees to people.  And it always takes me back to the change from agricultural economies to industrial.  What if we had taxed tractors and paid subsistence fees to agricultural workers who lost their jobs?  Would they have taken up industrial jobs?  They wouldn't.  And I admit that this transfer was extremely painful, but it was painful because we didn't have social systems and dedication.</p><p> So now our difficult equation is actually how to keep our social systems and dedication going when the traditional tax system is obviously going with traditional work system.  We gathering every morning into an enterprise and working for (ph) the same enterprise, having home address and demanding services in one country globally.  This is all going, and we've got to start talking about it right now.</p><p> And my understanding is that in future, our country will be hub for people, a (inaudible) kind of.  I've (inaudible) Estonia, but it provides me (ph) social and educational services, my children online tutoring in Estonia language wherever they are globally, but it doesn't necessitate me to have a postal address in Estonia or something.  It's a deal between me and this country.</p><p> And the problem of course is that if we are lazy in this thinking, then either we lose these services or they will all get privatized, which will actually lower their inclusivity, which might not be a problem for you here in America, but definitely for us in Europe, because our people expect us to provide a kind of school system, health system, health care system, which is available to almost (ph) everybody.  So we are much more afraid of -- of these kind of developments, that (inaudible) tax base.  But if we are rigid and say to people that unless you do it the old-fashioned way, we don't provide you with services, then they will opt out and go private, or simply go without, and then try to opt in, because only pension system penalizes late opt in.  Health-care system does not penalize late opt in in any way; educational system for our children either.</p><p> I mean, we need to figure it out, because otherwise we will lose the best proportion of earnings tax wise from the younger population.</p><p> And if you look globally, U.K., Netherlands, Estonia, the number of independently working people is already radically grown, so I'm not talking about tomorrow; I'm talking today.  And we need to really think about globally and internationally what to do about it.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  This is happening as we have -- we have a crisis of confidence in a whole host of institutions here in the U.S.  I'm a member of the fake news media.  You heard the president standing next to you make a reference to fake news yesterday.</p><p> But it's affecting our technology companies as well.  I mean, Facebook's position in the -- in the wake of Russian interference in the election.  How much of a challenge is that?  Do you see any similar loss of confidence or fear of big tech in Estonia, and if not, how -- how have you avoided that?</p><p> KALJULAID:  We feared Facebook as everybody else, of course.  It's pretty obvious, but the difference is we have alternatives to Facebook.  We have secure internet communication channels as well.</p><p> And I've ran around the globe for a year and a half telling everybody that this is unfair that governments have left people and businesses in internet without governmental support, because in the real world or (inaudible) world, you don't imagine that you cannot identify the other person with whom you are talking or interacting or contracting, at least at that point -- at least you would ask for a passport.  You don't board a plane without knowing that everybody has dutifully shown up their passports.  So we know with whom we are flying all the time.</p><p> For some reason, governments have failed to notice that their people and their businesses are in internet, and it's a big part of every transaction and quite a lot of communication change is online.</p><p> And I think governments have exactly the same obligation in the digital sphere to provide people with identification.  Estonians have had this way of establishing safe corridors in internet to communicate, because using your digital identity also will create an encrypted channel.  So it is failsafe, and, second, you know with whom you're talking.  And this kind of internet connection is not dangerous, so our people are not afraid of using -- of using digital signatures, but of course, they also worried about somebody taking their data on Facebook. KALJULAID:  And also we can differentiate.  We know this.  It's -- it's weird, but, well, I know people have fun with -- with these kind of things.  For example, one of my friends heard this.  Somebody told that, in Estonia, there exists a -- well, an ear (ph) doctor, and his name is -- is Dr. Ear (ph).  So he -- she wanted to check whether this is really true, and she Googled, and, for two months, she afterwards got all kinds of ear remedies, hearing devices, these kind of advertisements.</p><p> So people automatically assume that this is OK for kind of consumer services.  But, for some reason, they didn't realize that, if this is going on, then, of course, this is going on also for political debate. </p><p> And our people, since they can differentiate between safe and unsafe internet a little bit better -- because we have safe one, as well, and we are not forced to use the unsafe one if we don't want to -- then I think they are a bit more resilient than people elsewhere. </p><p> Yet they are afraid, of course, and they simply don't use Facebook, in that case, of course, if they are afraid.  Nobody would, anyway, contract over (ph) Facebook.  I don't know.  That would be weird, so.</p><p> Also, I've noticed that, in Estonia, people pay for internet time.  If they have transacted and signed a contract, then you don't use a credit card for payment, but you use safe channel.  You go to a bank, log in online and make an online payment.  It doesn't take much longer, but is much safer.  People prefer this and consider this safer than using credit cards online.</p><p> But they do it because it's as comfortable.  If it were more comfortable, or not possible, comfortably, to pay -- you'd need to walk to bank office, for example -- then, they would use credit cards.  So it has to be. </p><p> The -- the good internet has to be comfortable and available, and it starts from identification.  I cannot repeat this often enough.  It's our obligation as -- as governments to realize people have to have safe identification means in the internet sphere, as they have in real life.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  You have the advantage of having a genetic engineering degree, so -- very aware of -- of the health implications of a highly digitized society, particularly as it relates to privacy. </p><p> In light of what you were just discussing, social media, et cetera, how do you -- how do you handle those?  Because, of course, no one is more concerned about their privacy than when it comes to -- to health information.</p><p> KALJULAID:  I think all Estonian politicians always ask this question from all audiences:  Do you know who read your doctor's notes last?  Was it your doctor, or somebody you don't know?  When we in Estonia -- if somebody reads our -- I don't know, tax declaration, health information -- you know.</p><p> But, I mean, sometimes people think that Estonia is -- is a kind of wild world of -- world of internet.  It isn't.  It's actually a much stronger regulated world of internet.  Our government has given people numerous guarantees that they will know if somebody's -- looks around in their data. </p><p> We also gather genetic information of all our people.  It's another legally permissive environment -- result of Estonian way of having a state.  We -- we know much more of our -- our people's, well, genetic data -- common markers for common ailments (ph). </p><p> And we are enlarging this project, and -- and people are not afraid to participate, because state has given guarantees about how this data is to be handled.  Even your doctor wouldn't see it if you don't want it.  But then, probably, you don't want, first, to have this, and this is, of course, voluntary, whether you do or you don't.</p><p> So we have Estonian Genome Foundation, created at the same time as, more or less -- as the digital Estonia, and it's very similar in -- in what we did in digital.  We probably have done other things, but they have not flied (ph).  This flied (ph). </p><p> It flied (ph) for short term, from 2000 to 2003, because, you know, we created this environment where population and genetics was legal, and it wasn't in most countries, globally.  It was in Iceland.  Iceland was our only competitor, but, luckily, they have even tinier population.  So, to do population genetics in a population of 300,000 is -- is more of a joke than doing it in 1.3 million, which is still a joke, but something.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> So private companies flocked in and paid for founding Estonia Genome Foundation.  It was done on investment banking finance only.  But then what happened?  The governments came in.  The other governments, entering (ph) the market, because they, of course, started to buy all these services, because, of course, companies were clever enough to say that you have to pay.  It's not enough to create legal space.</p><p> And then, for 10 years, it was dormant until the technology became so cheap that, now, we can continue with -- with helping our people to understand the genetic risks of having heart attack, or diabetes II and other of these common ailments.</p><p> But, again, very often, people ask, then, that \"Are you afraid of\"  -- and we say no, because we know that this data is protected.  The state knows how to protect data.  And -- and it's in -- it's still in my ownership. </p><p> I mean, yes, it is in some kind of a database, but I own it.  It's not state's.  It's mine, and I decide who uses it, and how.  Personally, I don't mind if you know that my diabetes II risk is higher, and it is.  But that's fine with me, so I can tell it openly.</p><p> And I think it's important we work on these areas, as well, because 90 percent of the world's population, when they feel sick, what do they do first?  Google.  Nowadays, what you have on Google is mostly rubbish medical information. </p><p> But you need to have solid alternatives for people.  So medical doctors need to have access to people's data -- of course, without names and everything, so -- to analyze and create self-learning medical doctors who are able to respond to people.</p><p> NHS in Great Britain is experimenting, actually, that, if people call in the emergency line, and it's established that, in fact, it's not an emergency, then they are trying, with -- with a robot, to try to, well, direct this person to go to pharmacy or to go to doctor or whichever way. </p><p> But these systems have to have databases to learn.  And donating your information to them -- health information or genetic information -- in an anonymous format is a great thing to do for humanity.  But it needs to be safe, and it can be safe.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  But -- but how could you -- I guess the issue is, even with regulation, the question becomes confidence, right, and confidence in security, because I'm someone -- and listen, I -- I have such a baseline level of -- of digital knowledge, but -- but I have an assumption -- and this is partly because of the work that I do, but I -- also, I lived in China -- I have assumption that there is no actual privacy, because I've been a victim of -- of three or four -- of the three or four biggest hacks:  the OPM hack, the Anthem Healthcare one, and I forget what the other one -- I've lost track. </p><p> I have so many free digital ID services paid for by various entities that mishandled my information, I -- I don't even know.  So how do you get those two to come together?  Because you could have that knowledge, but, without confidence, then, you know...</p><p> KALJULAID:  First thing first.  This is the big problem of developing digital country like Estonia:  Lots of digital services provided online, indeed, with identification ways -- I don't know.  You use some username and some code, and then you write it on your computer, have a special file in your computer, et cetera.  It's unsafe, terribly unsafe.</p><p> Or take a very -- it's a concrete example.  I got it from Rudy Giuliani -- or I put the example together, but I learned from him.  E-prescription's pretty popular in United States, but it's an e-mail.  I'm sorry. </p><p> And, when something goes wrong with this e-mail, e-prescription, then confidence in all e-prescriptions is down the drain, including ours.  But our e-prescription system is much safer.  You -- you can never say it's absolutely safe, but it's definitely safer than paper analogs (ph), so I'm quite sure I call it safe. </p><p> But, when something goes wrong in one service, people lose trust in others.  And that is where we need to go up (ph) the confidence and trust of all our people, constantly explaining to our people where we differ. KALJULAID:  We are not, I mean, holding this to (ph) ourselves.  Actually, we very much like to expand our -- our X-Road, what we call, which is our identification system.</p><p>Finland is using the same, and we can change real -- real-time data with them.  We don't, because we haven't sold it legally, but, technically, we already can, if -- for example.</p><p> So we are open to others to use ours or similar systems.  We are not telling that you cannot do it.  But, if you come with us into this world, you have to take responsibility to -- explaining to your people how these services work. </p><p> And, in addition, you have to promise that you make some promises to your people about how -- and then you have to apply this in your law base (ph) -- how you use this data, how you protect this data, what is your obligation vis-a-vis your people in case you have this data.</p><p> For example, I would absolutely refuse to distribute our X-Road's technology to a company for -- which I knew that it has, let's say, only one single database where it tends to gather all the information about its citizens, et cetera.</p><p> But, I mean, if you do it in a smart -- smart and sharp way, and protect this, also, legally, what you are doing, and protect your people, it can be done, not only in Estonia, but all that's following (ph).  Denmark is quite good example, Luxembourg is quite good example.  We are small, but it's something.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Before -- I do want to go to the audience soon -- I do want to ask you about blockchain, because I know this is at the top of your list of interests.</p><p> Is the -- and, just out of curiosity, and you know far more than me -- but the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble, or at least the volatility there -- is that a just a bump on the road towards all the potential of blockchain technology?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Well, do we want to talk blockchain or Bitcoin?  Let's agree on that first?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SCIUTTO:  It's an example.</p><p> KALJULAID:  Totally bad example.  Let's take, then, Bitcoin.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> And, for Bitcoin, you don't need to be a -- a well -- well-established macroeconomists to understand that money needs economy, and a link to a real economy.  Then you know whether you have too much money, too little money, is it overvalued, undervalued -- all this. </p><p> I ask you, where's the underlying economy of Bitcoin?  There isn't.  Or, if there is, then we cannot measure it; therefore, we cannot understand what's the value of Bitcoin.  This much about Bitcoin -- I mean, this is an illusion. </p><p> This has an interesting afterthought, if I think more about the Bitcoin situation.  A well-known A.I. example says that A.I. is dangerous because it will make the world into paper clips.  And then people say, \"No, no.  A.I. will not be so stupid as to make the world into paper clips.\"</p><p> And I've also thought that maybe it wouldn't.  But, now, I mean, we are not A.I.  We are human beings, and we mine Bitcoin.  We spend real-life resources to the detriment of our environment -- lots of energy, et cetera, and other resources -- to mine something which has absolutely no value.  So, I mean, where exactly are we better than A.I., here, in this problem?</p><p> Now, to blockchain, this is different thing.  Blockchain is a technology which allows different systems to keep track about what different systems around it, with which it is connected, are doing.  And we think this is very useful technology. </p><p> It's -- it's one step forward from what we have, because our digital signature, for a normal person, would look pretty much like blockchain, because it's signature and it's timestamped.  It's similar enough for experts to look for the authors (ph) of Bitcoin in Estonia, but it's not the same technology.</p><p> So blockchain allows -- for our case, we think it will allow our state to go proactive in offering services.  How?  Right now, we still have to apply for state digital services, one by one.  For example, you have a child.  You register the birth, then you apply for social services.</p><p> But our people are starting to ask this question that -- I mean (ph), \"Government, you promised you would only ask once.  Now, you have the information that I have a baby, and we are entitled to a certain payment for this baby.\"</p><p> It's not relevant how much you earn, we have universal child support in Estonia. \"So why on earth, government, you now force me to apply, even if I can do it online?  Why I need to go to some home page and, I mean, ask for this service?  You can simply provide it to me.  I have a baby.  You know my bank account, because it's -- I pay taxes.  And you know I'm entitled to this money.  So why should I ask?\"</p><p> And the answer is, because we don't have blockchain.  Our systems do not have the capacity to make sure that -- I mean, one system -- what one system is doing -- that something's not going wrong at the same time at -- in the different system.  Blockchain will help us to solve this problem.</p><p> Our pilot is not social -- social security, because this is a high-confidence-level-demanding service.  Our pilot there is traffic accident -- simple traffic accident, which happens every day.  I mean, two cars get a little bit ruined.  It's an insurance case.  And we think that we -- by using blockchain, we can solve it in 30 minutes -- all the administrative questions.</p><p> So you register your traffic accident.  We have, of course, online car registry, and all these elements are there -- online insurance, full database of insurance schemes, et cetera.  So we could, actually, in 30 minutes, we think, send information to both parts (ph) of the accident, and -- about how this incident was solved. </p><p> But, for this, we need to have blockchain, which makes us also to think that -- when is the point when we need to create a legal entity for an -- learning -- or a machine learning system, or a machine system?  And we feel we are coming quite close to this point.  So we are now discussing exactly with -- how to regulate -- how to regulate, well, autonomous systems in our law base.</p><p> Attribution questions will rise.  And then, of course, it will be an interesting question.  I think I read it this morning in one Estonian daily (ph) -- it -- lawyers were discussing that, if a robot kills somebody, then how do we know that the robot did not get the order from its owner to kill somebody, but simply went crazy? </p><p> And, I mean, it's -- it's not -- I mean, it's not a laughing matter.  This is the questions we need to solve.  And also, for our -- this proactive state, we need to solve this question, and, yet again, we need to solve the question of privacy. </p><p> People probably need to somehow opt in to this kind of system, understanding and analyzing, themselves, whether they want to use or they don't want to use this. </p><p> So it's not easy, but we are thinking forward and we are forced to think forward, because, exactly, people are asking, \"You know this.  Why do I need to apply at all?\"  It's people who want this. </p><p> And government, once it has undertaken this digital disruption of society, cannot back off.  You have to continuously, all the time, first of all, make sure that the existing systems are still safe to use, that you can patch them up if something goes wrong and that you can continue developing.</p><p> And it is also true that, sometimes, things go wrong.  We have at least two means of identification online.  Yesterday, for two hours, one of them was down.  The other was working.  So we need to have alternatives.  But the problem with our country is that you cannot have digital with paper alternative.  You have to have digital with digital alternative.</p><p> And -- and we had this problem last year, where there is a chip maker, whom I wouldn't name, but maybe some of you know, which actually called 1 billion chips off the market, said that they aren't safe to use. </p><p> Most of these were door cards (ph).  High number was actually ID cards, but mostly in the countries which -- where people have IDs, but don't use them.  So they could be simply, well, shut down for a while.</p><p> We couldn't do it.  For us, it was right that (ph) the service continues, because our people refused it otherwise.  They wouldn't go to offices to queue for services.  KALJULAID:  They even got really angry that -- because some of them finally -- most of them could solve the problem online, but some couldn't.  And they had to go to a police or border guard office.  And then, we got loads of complaints that -- oh, kidding (ph), I had to queue for an hour.  And I mean, and then you explain to people that people in Western Europe normally take a day off to register their car.</p><p> So this is where you have your population, and this also demonstrates to you that whatever Estonian government wants you to do -- go completely back to paper-based system for example -- it simply cannot.  Disruption has happened, and now you have to live with the consequences and work forward to make sure that you are actually -- well, continuing to provide services to your people, to their satisfaction.</p><p> Which means that even we are on the Mars already, our people want us to be even further.  I mean so, Earth for them is not the solution.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  So wait, should we buy up block chain, or -- I wasn't clear.  I'm joking.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I got the answer loud and clear.  OK, so we're going to go to the -- to the assembled audience here for questions.  I think we have about a half hour.  Gentleman in the back with his hand raised?  And there are -- yes, there are microphones.</p><p> Please if you can, identify yourself.  And the other guidance I always give is phrase it in a question rather than a statement or a speech.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> QUESTION:  Michael Shraig (ph) with MIT.</p><p>Estonia is a very small country, as you pointed out.  China, huge country.  United States, huge country.  Key to making machine learning work is scale.  You're a small -- you're a scientist, you're from a small country, but you deal with giants and behemoths.</p><p> What's the most important thing you've learned about managing scale in an environment where petabytes and zettabytes is the future of what you're talking about?</p><p> KALJULAID:  First thing to realize is indeed that scale wise, we don't create technology.  We use technology quite common in private sector globally, so we don't have to carry the cost, and we fully understand that we don't control the delivery chain of this technology.</p><p> And this is why we need to make sure we're using, let's say, these digital chips, that we also have mobile I.D., for example, because we simply don't control the technology.  But this is what makes it available.</p><p> If you now look more locally in Estonia, then since we've had absolute inclusivity, this digital chip is part of our I.D. card, with which we travel as well, at least within the European Union.  Then this inclusivity from the other side is (inaudible).  So for local services actually, companies have it quite good.  They have the 1.3 million market at least, immediately at their hand.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Gentleman here?</p><p> QUESTION:  I thank you for your comments today.  Two questions, one -- are (ph) there related.  One is recently Estonia joined a number of other countries, including the U.S., in condemning the NotPetya worm and attributing it to Russia.</p><p> This is always a delicate question when you have this kind of collective response.  What -- attribution the other day is a -- is a, you know, political issue.  What level of confidence do you need, does Estonia need, to join that kind of collective because it's more powerful?</p><p> And then on Russia, what kinds of actions would you think would be effective in actually deterring their behavior in cyberspace?  You said that we need to do more.  McMaster said that last night.  What kinds of things would actually work?</p><p> KALJULAID:  In cyberspace, we need monitoring, and we need to agree that international monitoring is allowed, and that there will be elements and events which will trigger international monitoring, very similarly as you have with (ph) sensitive nuclear technology globally.  We need to agree what it is.</p><p> I give you a few examples.  Radical shift in energy consumption in some laboratory or somewhere is one thing.  Second is now we understood that we need to create the, like, neural networks to be able to think of A.I. which will not consume so much energy that it will be dead immediately.  These could be regulated.  This is hardware after all.  This could be regulated that you need to allow international monitoring, and this -- well, we need to bring in globally all countries.  Because as I said, it's not anymore enough like in the nuclear case, that some countries agree and the rest will simply, well, accept because they don't have the weapons.  It's global, and we don't know where it will -- where it will happen.  So this much for regulation.</p><p> For confidence level, it's not quantitative; it's always qualitative analysis, and depends -- well it very much, you have to go case by case.</p><p> But it's interesting that we're joining (ph), because for us it's a solidarity act, because NotPetya didn't pass in Estonia, only in one international company system, which was not linked to Estonian system.  Pure (ph) act of solidarity.</p><p> QUESTION:  Is there a mic?</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Yeah, it's coming.</p><p> QUESTION:  Fran Burwell from the Atlantic Council.</p><p> Two questions.  First off, when you are thinking about how to deter or respond to an attack, does it matter if it is a nation-state behind it, or whether it is organized crime, or is it the same response?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Same.</p><p> QUESTION:  And -- OK.  And the other thing is, you raised the issue of taxes.  But your approach to tax sounds a little bit different for me from what has been proposed by some E.U. governments, including in terms of taxing digital enterprises, which, as you're well aware, some people here fear is aimed primarily at some large U.S. companies in Europe.  Can you be a little bit more specific about where you think taxes should go to counter this -- to deal with this new world?</p><p> KALJULAID:  I can be a little bit more specific.  Fully aware that first of all, I am in -- I'm in contradiction with much of the European thinking, plus OSCE (ph) rules, everything.  So we absolutely need to modify international space, and we cannot go alone.  So we need to first understand that, I mean, we have this problem, and then we need to start seeking solutions.  And voluntary declaration of (inaudible) with any chosen state would be actually something, which probably is the -- is the solution to the problem.  And I realize I'm -- that we are very far from -- from getting there.</p><p> Meanwhile, Europe is doing what they always do in these kinds of systems.  You apply a patch, and then you see what you can do to solve -- solve the problem as it is.  And I think applying patches meanwhile to make sure that society is at least accepting that, I mean, we do need to tax differently, just because internet exists, is -- is a step in right direction.  Of course it can be inhibitive to -- to some investment and so on.  And I'm not necessarily supporting it, but I see where it comes from politically.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Gentleman standing in the back?</p><p> QUESTION:  I'm Basil Scarliss (ph).  I've been involved in foreign affairs.</p><p> And I have a question on sanctions.  Perhaps a good way to deter Russian cyber attacks and other meddling and military action would be to have a more effective regime for punishing the Russian leader and the oligarchs.</p><p> And one obstacle is that in the United States, and to some extent in the United Kingdom, we allow shell companies to purchase properties, to make investments in corporations and in other organizations without revealing the beneficial owner; they can hide behind an attorney.</p><p> The question I have, is do you think it would be much more effective to have targeted sanctions, especially if we could get Congress to pass appropriate legislation? KALJULAID:  Simple answer would be yes.</p><p> Then the political answer would be doesn't concern me, because Estonia doesn't have that much oligarchic money in the country.  It's a tiny economy, completely transparent as well, because digital makes it also transparent.</p><p> And -- and the practical answer is that I think yes, but we must make sure that we remain rule-of-law countries while we do it, as well.  This is very important.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  If I could follow on that, this issue comes up -- it came with the response to Skripal attack -- that the next level would have been true financial penalties for people in power.</p><p> You'll often hear -- whether with Ukraine, U.S. election interference -- about going after Putin's money, whether freezing it or exposing it to -- to his people -- all of his various holdings around the world.</p><p> Why hasn't that happened yet, in your view?</p><p> KALJULAID:  I simply don't know.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Good answer. </p><p> There's a group of folks here, but maybe I'll just go from the forward, back.  There's a gentleman, and then behind two, and we'll go from there.</p><p> QUESTION:  Hans Binnendijk from SAIS.  First of all, let me say it's so refreshing to hear a president be able to converse the way you do on these issues. </p><p> I'd like to ask about Russian attacks using social media.  This is below the denial-of-service level.  What has been your experience -- not just in Estonia, but in a -- in the Baltic States in general -- with regard to Russian use of social media to try to affect the opinions of your minorities -- Russian-speaking minorities?</p><p> What have you been able to do about that?  I presume you're countering it.  And what lessons do you have for us in this area?</p><p> KALJULAID:  First, Baltic states -- well, I cannot say we have seen more of these kind of attacks.  I think Germany has had a fair share, and visa case (ph) -- every German knows it.  And -- and Emmanuel Macron called Putin out on disrupting the French election processes. </p><p> We have been expecting and preparing for -- when EFP (ph) was established -- that we will have quite some.  Lithuania had one, but the reaction was so quick -- retaliation from Lithuania -- to inform people that this is false news, to make sure that everybody got it -- it was false news -- was so good.</p><p> But we've actually not seen any further elements.  But we are, of course, ready all the time.  And the only way to be ready is to tell your people this exists.  We talk about troll factories.  We show people that they do exist.  And, frankly, try to read anonymous internet commentary under some article about -- I don't know, I do it under my articles about myself.</p><p> I recognize a troll writing quite soon.  They are trying to put a message out about you, which comes whichever way -- I mean, it -- it comes.  And you have a few -- few kind of names which always will appear.  And then you learn to recognize it.</p><p> And -- and people, having live in -- lived a long time in the internet sphere, learn to understand this.  Of course, we all have a big problem that most of the population is not able to differentiate between journalism -- something which pretends to be journalism and -- and something which think it is journalism, because they are -- well, I think those people who don't realize that they are not journalists, but they do -- don't do it in bad will.</p><p> And, previously, I expected journalists to check their facts when they provide them to me.  For some reason, I cannot do it, and I think here is also a frank discussion to be had, because lots of fakes new -- fake news will die if people knew that the safe channels will never pick them up.  Yet safe channels stay after they (ph) pick them up.</p><p> And we need to radically think how to avoid this.  First of all, we all need to start paying for our online news, and then we can continue this discussion.  I'm sorry it starts with that.  Currently, the media sector has no resources to deal with it.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  There's a couple questions coming in from Twitters (ph).  So, Madam President, this one is, \"We have an obligation to explain the issues around privacy and responsibility to citizens,\" relevant to what you were just discussing.  \"How has Estonia brought citizenry to a level where they can understand the explanation?\"</p><p> And I'm -- I could identify with this, because, I'm sure, like you, you agree to terms that you don't know or read what those terms are, frequently.  And so how do you manage that?</p><p> KALJULAID:  We have only one set of terms, and this is state-guaranteed digital identity.  It's not too much to ask people to understand one set of terms and conditions. </p><p> And the terms and conditions are roughly the same.  You keep your identity -- physical one -- separate from the passwords.  And, if this, for some reason, was not the case, you run quickly or go online quickly somewhere where you can, well, just close your identity.</p><p> This is the basic drill.  But we have to do it only one copy, because we have the universal system.  And that is how we can build trust.  And, of course, it is -- government is on the line. </p><p> It's government which is giving this currently.  It's not Google or Amazon or -- or somebody anonymous or not in your country.  And I'm sorry -- it wouldn't get better unless more governments take this responsibility.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  (Inaudible) gentleman in the beard, and then -- well, actually, you both have beards.  So...</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> ... we'll just have to go to -- left to right.</p><p> QUESTION:  Hey.  Matt Leonard with Government Computer News. </p><p> Can you talk briefly about the data embassy that you guys opened up last summer, what its current role is and any plans for opening up other data embassies, going forward?</p><p> KALJULAID:  There's not much to talk about.  It's a simple thing.  Every private enterprise has a safe copy of everything it has, and, if the country's legal base allows it, has it outside of the country.</p><p> Now, we have a copy of Estonian state, every minute, every moment, in -- in a data embassy.  And, since it is state and state data and we need to make sure that our law base about this data and what applies to this data will apply to where it is, we cannot simply establish a server somewhere. </p><p> We need to have an agreement with Luxembourg, also a very digitally minded and forward-looking country, that we will create a data embassy.  So this server park (ph) is a sovereign territory of Estonia, and these servers and this data is -- belong to Estonian state.  And, again, there is nothing technologically interesting.</p><p> Interesting thing is law space, which we two together created, between Luxembourg and Estonia.  Whether we need to have more copies -- well, time will tell.  But I am quite sure that people would -- would be quite happy to host Estonian data embassy. </p><p> On the other hand, other states need data embassies too.  So -- they all have data which they need to store.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  And just -- I'm curious.  Are those updated constantly, then?  Because, if my -- my -- if I'm an insurance company, I don't know -- today's data is different from next week's data?</p><p> KALJULAID:  Yes.  As I said, all Estonian digital signatures are timestamped.  So, in this sense, they are like blockchain, yes.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  And then did you (ph) -- if you still have a question -- the gentleman here.</p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you very much. Grigory (ph) (inaudible) of Russian news agency.  So, first question, how -- do you think Estonia needs more NATO (ph) troops to deter Russia?  And, if so, how many troops do you need?</p><p> And the second one is about Skripal poisoning.  So Estonia expelled a Russian diplomat, and -- but British experts said yesterday that they don't know a region of the agent that poisoned Skripal and his daughter.</p><p> So do you -- do you still believe your actions to expel Russian diplomat was justified?  And do we (ph) have any evidence of Russian involvement in these poisoning?  Or this is just a matter of solidarity with European countries? KALJULAID:  As most countries trace (ph) -- they didn't send out simply diplomats.  They sent out diplomats who were acting in a way as diplomats shouldn't act.  So there was another reason for -- for this concerted action.</p><p> What -- what concerns NATO troops, then -- NATO deterrence is -- well, has a history of being 100 percent efficient and effective.  NATO has never failed to protect its territory.  And it's -- in its entirety.</p><p> And we trust into this capacity to deter.  And we're quite sure that all NATO steps are always adequate to make sure that this deterrence is -- is -- is valued.</p><p> In the summer, NATO summit will come together and discuss again those issues and these -- those elements.  Our role there is to provide honest and open analysis of the security situation, considering conventional risks around our territory and among those -- well, is the information, which we have also talked publicly.</p><p> Today, the level of conventional capacity surrounding NATO's eastern flank is at the level of 2009 Zapad exercise.  We need to draw conclusions from that.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  In the far back here.</p><p> QUESTION:  Hi.</p><p> So, I've read that there are efforts to use blockchain technology in order to -- for example, in the Estonian stock exchange, to make voting easier and more secure and like it -- you know, immutable ledger and all that.  You know, it's distributed.</p><p> There's also efforts in Australia to -- company called My Vote, I think, to utilize the -- you know, relatively secure and distributed immutable ledger to help voting.  And I've also heard the idea for voter registries.</p><p> So I'm just curious, is Estonia considering using blockchain for voter database -- or yeah, voter registry databases, or e-voting -- like direct e-voting itself for candidates, or for referendums at the local level or at the larger level?</p><p> Because I've heard that.  It's an interesting idea and Estonia seems to be a little bit on the cutting edge of using those technologies.</p><p> So yeah, just blockchain in voting systems basically is the question.</p><p> KALJULAID:  Basically, we have e-voting and this system is tried and tested and free for everybody to try and hack.  And voting is the highest confidence level digital service, so you change our voting technology only when you have tried and tested the new technology developments.  And you have taught your people that this technology is safe.</p><p> On lower confidence level of services, voting should be the last which will shift technology, once you already have an established system of secure voting, which we have.</p><p> So I predict that all other Estonian public services will be blockchain based before our e-voting system will change.</p><p> And I always tell to other countries, some -- some countries would say, \"Let's start from e-voting.\"  And I always say, \"That's a terribly bad idea.  Start from school applications or something really -- well, low-worry services.  Never start from e-voting.\"</p><p> You have to teach a population cyber hygiene first.  You have to teach them to trust the system.  And only then you should apply -- you should try to apply this technology to high-confidence level services like voting.</p><p> On the other hand, sometimes we get discussion that e-voting must be terribly unsafe.  And it comes from people who vote by post, so beats me how this discussion can come up, but it does still come up.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Well, it's a very common fear here, though.  I think you would -- I can't imagine a -- and, of course, it's run by states here, but I can't imagine a state legislature who'd push hard for it today, because there is that lack of confidence.</p><p> Question from Twitter here:  \"Madam President, you speak about the need for government-mandated digital identity.  Many people are concerned that this gives too much power to governments.  Do you see a need for anonymous transactions?  And if so, in what cases?\"</p><p> KALJULAID:  Well, I'm -- in my character, I'm a simple housewifish politician, and -- and this philosophical question has been bothering me a long time now.  Why people in free world trust their banks and Google and Amazon, but don't trust their government?</p><p> And I don't -- I don't know the answer, but I think we need to have some really good philosophers and social scientists analyzing this question.</p><p> It's not technology what they are mistrusting.  They are not trusting, for some reason, their government.  I don't know why.</p><p> It may be different in every society.  There may be similarities.  I come from a society where people trust government in this sense.  They don't trust it for, I don't know, having -- having a good tax system, or actually our people are very, very critical about our -- our government.  It's a national tradition to think we are a badly run country.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> I'm not joking.  I mean, in 1943, the chairman of the Bank of England, Lord Wedgwood, he said that Estonia was the best-run country in northern Europe.  And then one of our politicians said that the other diplomats told him that, and it's astonishing how little your people appreciate it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> It's still the same.</p><p> But they trust government when government provides digital services.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  There's a gentleman here along the aisle, and then we'll go to the back.  I think we're getting down to probably the last question or two.</p><p> QUESTION:  All right, thank you.  Johnathan Lynchman (ph) from the Providence Group.</p><p> You've mentioned a couple of times about educating the public, cyber hygiene.  And I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what Estonia does with respect to public education on cyber-security and public information, in terms of making sure that it's both effective and that it reaches everyone.</p><p> KALJULAID:  Well, teaching hygiene is not as effective as, I don't know, applying some social services.  It never will be, because if you think about when we taught people simple hygiene, it was also a lengthy process which gradually reached our people's brains.  That you have to wash hands, otherwise you will fall sick; or you have to use toilets, because it's not hygienic to just go to the wood.</p><p> And it took us time.  But I think we have nowadays much better communication means to teach our people cyber hygiene.</p><p> And the truth is, we have to start from this and many people haven't done it.  Technology will not solve it.  There will never be a technology which will be able to cover for all human errors.  The only way is to tell people that, \"You are responsible.\"</p><p> And the way to do it is education.  I mean, you have to teach people at school about the risks of internet.  We have (inaudible) police which goes around the schools and teaches children.  And it also teaches them that it's just -- I mean, if it's not nice to be rude toward, well, the other kids in class in real life, it's as rude in internet, et cetera.  It starts from this low-level thing.</p><p> On the other hand, I recognize that most countries are now in bigger difficulty than Estonia, because we started teaching cyber hygiene at the turn of the century.  And then the risk was some virus, and you just downloaded Kaspersky or something else.  And -- and then it was cleared.  Now you have to jump into the internet of things.</p><p> Yet saying that it's impossible doesn't -- I mean, doesn't solve the problem, so we have to try.  And I think it has to go down to (inaudible) and primary education, this cyber hygiene teaching.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Oh, right here in the front.  And then we'll go to the back, if that's OK.  Sorry, I'm having you...</p><p> QUESTION:  I can -- I -- I'm pretty loud.  I'm Claudia Jona (ph) from the Atlantic Council.</p><p> What is your take on the -- on the -- (inaudible) deadlock (ph) on the global discussion on cyber norms?  What is your take on -- on why the discussion -- where it's where it is right now? KALJULAID:  I'm disappointed that the process in United Nations fell through.  And I'm quite sure that we need to revive it.</p><p>Estonia, among other things, have decided to run for United Nations Security Council, and we are in the active phase of campaign.  And whether we win or we lose, this is in our talking points about discussing global security.</p><p> New Zealand took climate to the Security Council.  We will take digital to the Security Council.  And when we are elected, and we hope we will be, this is (inaudible) platform, definitely, and we need to continue.</p><p> There was a working group.  Marina Coleron (ph) from Estonia was -- was -- was responsible for that work as well, and -- and we were deeply disappointed when this got stalled.  But the problem has not gone away.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  In the back, here.</p><p> QUESTION:  Madam President, Franica Jerka (ph), Broadcasting Board of Governors.  </p><p> In this city, there is ongoing discussion how to counter Russian propaganda (inaudible).  So my question is, do you believe the blocking of Russian TV channels, like it was made in Ukraine, like it will -- it will be in Moldova, in other countries, is an efficient measure?  And the second question, do you think is it a good time for now, especially now, for Western countries -- United States, European Union -- to create, re-create, revive (inaudible) broadcasters like Voice of America or PRL (ph) in Baltic states or central European countries?  Thank you.</p><p>  KALJULAID:  I don't believe in restricting access to media outlets, even if I don't think they are free media outlets.  I believe in telling my people that these are not free media outlets, so this is something which pretends to be media, or it's a government-run media.  And we in Estonia, we do not restrict access to these media, yet we discuss this -- these channels and -- and everybody's free to choose whether, for example, to talk to them, and to -- how to react to them.  But it needs to be known, and this is important.</p><p> But we need to not only think in the terms of Russia here.  I think it would help everybody in this discussion to realize that the sources of fake news are numerous actually.  I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty tough on Russia, but, I mean, sometimes I feel that people attribute all the problems in the global world to Russia.  </p><p> Fake news can come from everywhere.  There are various reasons for producing fake news, including somebody may simply want to sell their products, and -- and do away with somebody else's.  I don't know.  Somebody could say that Asics -- Asics running gear is -- is dangerous to your legs, and that doctors have analyzed and realized that because the first and -- and the back kind of padding are separate -- which is not the case for Nike running shoes -- it's dangerous.  </p><p> So I mean, we have to analyze this in general, and need to teach our people how to check the facts.  On the other hand, again, we need to get back a media space which we can trust somehow.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  I think this -- well, let's see.  Maybe we have time for two more up there quick.  There's a lady here, and then someone who I keep forgetting to go to in the way, way back.</p><p> QUESTION:  Thank you very much.  Susan Ness, SAIS Center for Transatlantic Relations.</p><p> We talked extensively about the fake news issue.  Also, within the European Union, there are efforts underway with respect to hate speech, to curtail that through government regulation.  We'd like to know whether there is a major hate speech problem within Estonia, and if so, what role should government play in curtailing hate speech?  Thank you.</p><p> KALJULAID:  First of all, I don't sense that we have a big hate speech problem in Estonia.  Second, I think that good habits is something which you shouldn't always try to write into the law text, because if we do away with good habits, and only go by law, then we are not the humankind.  We like it, and we want it.  So I don't believe in regulating everything.</p><p> I think most people can recognize when it is hate speech.  When -- when it goes to the territory that considerable losses are occurred (ph) to the other party by -- by something which has been said, then we have our court system, which can provide and solve (ph), even in the current legal space, for these cases.  But I don't think that, well, you should legislate something you cannot define, really.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  So this will have to be the final one.  And I can only see your hand, so I can't say -- oh, there you are.</p><p> QUESTION:  Hi.  How do you -- I mean, in terms of the ever-evolving capabilities of A.I., how long until you think machines will supplant the human workforce?  And what will the workforce do with their newfound time?  And I guess that's the end of my question. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> KALJULAID: I am a politician; I'm not clairvoyant.  But first of all, we see already that technology does not only take away jobs, but it creates it as well.  I gave you a few examples, how I think that actually handicapped people, people with high -- high home-work burden, like women with small children, they actually are much freer to act in the new technology world actively on the job market.  </p><p> So good things are happening, and they're happening also to people with limited education and skills.  For example, channeling YouTube may make quite good money, and it doesn't take a degree at all.</p><p> So new jobs are coming.  I don't know where, but the important thing is that we should actually support this change, not try to hold it back.  I'm quite sure that in 15 years' time, in industry, all the things we need will be made with the same proportional workforce, which is currently in agriculture, 3 to 4 percent of all workforce, not more.  The rest will work elsewhere, and they will do something online.  What exactly, who knows?  </p><p> Some things we can see already, but I'm sure there will be much more new stuff emerging, which we cannot imagine right now.  At least, I cannot.  I have a, well, not very good imagination.</p><p> SCIUTTO:  Madam President, thank you very much.  Just a phenomenal discussion.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> END </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-577758</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1K-MM71-JBSW-72HJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

Thank you for joining us today. I'm David Lashway, and I lead Baker McKenzie's cyber-security global practice. Delighted to have you all with us today.   </p><p>      Good morning, Madam President. Thank you for joining us. Damon Wilson and the folks from the Atlantic Council, thank you for hosting today with us. Jim Schiutto from CNN is here, as well, and will be carrying the day in the discussions later this morning. So thank you all.  </p><p>      Distinguished guests -- Mr. Chertoff, thank you for being here. It's good to see you and some old friends, Chris Boehner (ph) and others from the State Department. Thank you for joining us today.  </p><p>      Yesterday, Madam President, while at the White House, you reminded us of the blue, black and white of your flag and that you will always remember that it flew in -- here in America when it could not fly in Estonia, during 50 years of the 100 years that we celebrate during your visit today, due to occupation.  </p><p>      You reminded us, as well, of our partnership to confront challenges, and that that partnership is based upon three common things:  one, an understanding; two, the rule of law; and three, and perhaps most importantly, common beliefs. You said that we form the axis of the good based upon these.  </p><p>      We are proud to fly the blue, black and white of your flag here today, and we welcome you to the discussion to advance our common beliefs and understanding around cyber-security and other security risks, both in Estonia, in Europe more generally and here in the United States.   </p><p>      Marie Under, perhaps the most notable 20th-century Estonian poet, who lived during Soviet occupation and wrote of her experience, in her famous poem, \"Night,\" wrote, \"And, hand in hand, we walk uphill together.\"   </p><p>      I hope that, through the discussion today, we will go hand in hand through this discussion and through what will confront us in cyber in the days ahead.  </p><p>      And, finally, as we were just discussing this morning and as you mentioned yesterday, you reminded us Americans to reflect on the words that are carved in the granite monuments around our mall. That caused me to pause this morning and think for a moment of all the different statements that are carved across the mall that we look out on today.   </p><p>      And, on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death, no statement came to mind more than this -- perhaps one of the great American poets in Mr. King:  \"If we are to have peace on Earth,\" he said, \"our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class and our nation, and this makes us better. And, in common, we must develop a world perspective.\"  </p><p>      Thank you for sharing your perspective today. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to the discussion.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PAVEL</emphasis>:  Good morning, and welcome, everyone. I'm Barry Pavel. I'm a senior vice president at the Atlantic Council, and I direct the Scowcroft Center on -- on Strategy and Security there.   </p><p>      On behalf of the council, I'm really honored to -- to welcome you to our conversation with -- with President Kaljulaid of the Republic of Estonia, especially since this is her first public event here in Washington, D.C. And, Madam President, thank you so much for being -- for being here with us.   </p><p>      Again, I'd also like to welcome those of you who are following the webcast online. Please feel free to join the conversation on Twitter, using the hashtag #USBalticSummit, and the account @cyberstatecraft.  </p><p>      In today's discussion, we'll be touching on issues that -- that, in my view, will be key to the decade unfolding ahead of us, and those issues include artificial intelligence, blockchain and cyber-security, all matters on which President Kaljulaid has a strong voice and leadership, particularly given her presidency of a country undertaking what the New Yorker has called \"the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PAVEL</emphasis>:  Estonia has been at the cutting edge of the digital revolution since well before most of us were actually calling it a revolution.  </p><p>      By the late 1990s, all of Estonia's schools were online. And since then, it's gone digital on all its government services and set up data embassies outside the country to safeguard that information.  </p><p>      That's the kind of cyber foresight that we could use more of. And that's why we're so proud to have President Kaljulaid with us today.  </p><p>      At the Atlantic Council, we've redoubled our efforts toward fostering an international community of like-minded states and reinvigorating an adaptive set of global norms and rules built on common principles such as openness, transparency and the rule of law. Sometimes we do that the old-fashioned way through diplomacy and summits, but we're also passionate about innovating wherever useful and needed.  </p><p>      Estonia's project of digital statecraft, or e-Estonia, perfectly mirrors that spirit of much-needed innovation. By leveraging technology to transform everything from voting to citizenship, Estonia has shown us how to bring these tried and tested values forward into this century.  </p><p>      But of course introducing a digital -- digital element to governance also introduces risks, as Estonia itself knows very well from the cyber attacks of 2007. The very freedom and connectivity that makes our societies what they are, also opens us to malicious activities undertaken by those who oppose our values, as Lieutenant General McMaster outlined so passionately and eloquently before some of us at the Atlantic Council last evening in his final public remarks as national security advisor.  </p><p>      Estonia used the -- Estonia used the 2007 attack to turn its vulnerabilities into strengths, and it's now widely considered a global leader on cyber-security, with Tallinn hosting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.  </p><p>      But it underscores the need for us to devote real resources to protecting our increasingly information-based societies. And though we are already doing much to safeguard ourselves, as General McMaster said, much more work remains to be done on all fronts and in very close coordination with our allies.  </p><p>      And that's why at the Scowcroft Center we devote so many sustained efforts to strengthening cyber statecraft, working closely with key allies in every region of the world. And that's why we organize teams to visit the Baltics -- as we are doing next week, for example -- to engage more directly with our allies, to help shore up deterrence, defense and resilience against the foremost security challenges that we face.  </p><p>      And with that, let me introduce President Kaljulaid and our moderator, Jim Sciutto, to -- to speak to both the promise and peril of digital statecraft.  </p><p>      Before becoming the president of Estonia in 2016, President Kaljulaid served as a member of the European Court of Auditors from 2004 to 2016, where she organized the financial audit of E.U. R&amp;D funds, among many other leading responsibilities. She also was the economic adviser to the prime minister from 1999 to 2002, as well as CFO and CEO of the IRU power plant.  </p><p>      Leading our discussion today will be Jim Sciutto, chief national security correspondent of CNN; most importantly, a Villanova fan, for those of us from that area.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      With his extensive experience reporting overseas across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, we couldn't have asked for a better guide for this conversation.  </p><p>      He was the only American journalist to embed with U.S. special forces during the Iraq invasion, and he has reported undercover from inside Myanmar, and he reported Iran's first reaction to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union remarks.  </p><p>      Before we turn to Jim and Kaljulaid, I wanted to thank Baker &amp; McKenzie for hosting us today.  </p><p>      Thanks very much.  </p><p>      Thanks David Lashway, partner here at the firm, also for his continuous support of our cyber efforts at the Atlantic Council.  </p><p>      And now let's get to the good stuff. Thanks again. And I'll hand it over to our esteemed panelists.  </p><p>      Thank you very much.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Thank you for the kind introduction. Thanks so much to the Atlantic Council, Baker &amp; McKenzie, and -- and thank you, President Kaljulaid, for allowing me to sit across from you and throw a few questions your way.  </p><p>      I've had -- I've had the good fortune of spending some time in Estonia and interacting with -- with Estonian officials, interviewed foreign minister, as I've covered the Russian story and had some nice visits there as well. And I feel lucky for that. In fact, I spent my birthday last year in Estonia.  </p><p>      And as you know, it just -- it's a remarkable position, I think, in what has become a dominant national security line for the U.S., as a neighbor to Russia, as one of the first victims of a coordinated Russia cyber attack in 2007; really unprecedented but -- but foreshadowing of things to come.  </p><p>      And yet as a country, doubling down, all-in on the digitized society without hesitation and -- and with full confidence. And finding their (ph) way forward. Certainly a lot of lessons to be learned there, I think for -- for Europe for the U.S.  </p><p>      The subject today, of course, artificial intelligence, et cetera.  </p><p>      I do want to start, if I can, just in light of your visit here and your time yesterday in the White House, I'm curious, do you have confidence that the U.S. is a solid partner for you as you face challenges from Russia, particular cyber challenges from Russia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes, I have to say I have great confidence in this administration and in American people. And as I also said yesterday, this confidence is not (inaudible). It has (inaudible) in this common, shared values (ph) which we all have. And (inaudible) that, and I think it's pretty obvious that we can have confidence.  </p><p>      And I have to say that we've had really good cooperation with his administration (ph) since he took office. (Inaudible). Also (inaudible) -- for example, on nuclear weapons in 21st century, (inaudible) U.N. Security Council (ph) (inaudible) et cetera. So the contents are close and (inaudible). And this gives us confidence (inaudible). And it doesn't (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  If I could start on -- I want to get to artificial intelligence very quickly, but just on cyber, to describe to folks -- one thing that struck me when I was in Estonia is just the frequency of cyber attacks. This is -- this is a daily event, many times a day. These are the numbers of the way it works, right? It doesn't come in -- you know, in pairs or in dozens, it comes constantly.  </p><p>      How is it today? And -- and -- and where are the attacks coming from? How aggressive are they? And how do you push back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) just because you can't see this in the United States (inaudible). (Inaudible) you also have systems where (inaudible) and analyzed (inaudible) we also learned (inaudible) quite a number of them came from Russia (inaudible) Estonia. And this is how it is.  </p><p>      In most of the cases you don't allow it (ph). You just deter and (inaudible) but we don't analyze where it comes from, because they are (inaudible).  </p><p>      But (inaudible) or in case you see that someone is coming out (ph) (inaudible) systems, they're not (ph) (inaudible) analyze also where they came from.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  But in most of the cases, it simply doesn't give (inaudible) to deem this piece, because (inaudible) anyway and if it will not have a particular reason to -- to try to (inaudible). Then it just doesn't cooperate. It's just how cyber works, and I don't that it will ever change. This is how it is while...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  The outgoing national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, said last night that -- and he's not alone in this. You've heard this from many members of the administration, but also from folks outside -- that the U.S. and the West have not yet imposed sufficient costs on Russia to deter activity -- and not just cyber activity, other activity -- in Ukraine, et cetera. Do you agree with that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I think there is considerable space to improve. What has (inaudible) and which has come to many peoples' mind is to go off of the Russian money (ph) that don't perceive to go out to something which were very good. Most of the (inaudible) happened that the discussion was whether or not to throw Russia out of the international money transfer (inaudible), another option, for example, but I think actions need to be proportionate, and meanwhile it's also wise to say that we've been talking as well.  </p><p>      Talking all of this (inaudible) and understand this one is going to get as well (ph). (inaudible), this comes from only one source. This is the unit (ph), and we know that. We see it. We observe it very often that, for example, when there are attempts to break off from, let's say, all sanctions on Ukraine, then there is quite clever Russian persons assigned to understand where these attacks are going and trying to use this (inaudible) immediately.  </p><p>      And I would even say that quite often Russia goes where it thinks that this total (ph) result may be neglecting this part of Europe or region. I think this happened in Georgia. I think this happened in Ukraine. These countries were trying and -- were trying to come closer to Europe for some time, and obviously Europe (inaudible) to provide (inaudible) and clear opportunity and possibilities on how to come (inaudible) members (ph). So we saw that things went wrong.  </p><p>      And actually at the same line, in my mind (inaudible). Maybe there was an understanding that Euro-solidarity is broken because of Brexit. Now, (inaudible), and this is, of course, where we are as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  In the case -- in cases like this, where you have comprehensive and quite damaging cyber attacks, in your view, does Article V apply?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I'm quite sure that also if you read the academic analysis of what cyber might cause and that it can have as devastating consequences to a nation's security as conventional attacks, then I'm quite sure that we can imagine situations where Article V would apply. But until you have tested, you'll never know.  </p><p>      On the other hand, you don't want to bring the threshold of calling Article V low, so it will always be a difficult question on how to move forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  But that is the Russian strategy, is it not, to pursue activities and attacks that are just below the perceived threshold of a coordinated response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes, but when it becomes dangerous to a country's security and sovereignty, then you know that you have to go and say, \"This is an Article V situation.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Now, did you consider that in 2007? Because this was quite -- I mean, this was an attack designed to cut Estonia off, right, in effect?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First of all, 2007 attack was in no way dangerous to Estonia's security, because what Estonia was able to do in 2007, it walled off the country. Inside the country, services was running, so Estonia was not down. What was down was the external connection to Estonia.  </p><p>      I was in Luxembourg. I couldn't access my bank account, but all Estonians in Estonia could and the services were up and running. So it definitely was not an attack which could -- which could have actually been a risk to this country's security.  </p><p>      In addition, it wasn't -- it wasn't very effective in -- in attacking the vital systems of the country. Digital government systems, yes. But I mean, nobody dies if they are down for two hours. They were mostly functional and they were just walled off from the rest of the internet world.  </p><p>      The simple denial of the service attack, which nowadays is very common. So definitely, that would not have been an Article V case.  </p><p>      But if you think of the whole 2007 situation, with Russia provoking also -- also while people were fighting on the streets for a couple of nights, et cetera, so you had -- you had a more dire situation than just a cyber attack and you had to see all of these facts together. That was a cyber attack combined with what else was going on in the country, and that is why the European partners and allies also came out in strong support of Estonia, calling out that this is Russian.  </p><p>      And this is very important that this call came; that nobody then asked (inaudible) questions, et cetera, probably because they couldn't yet. I mean, this was not the common thinking then. Everybody was in shock and awe that cyber attack against a nation can exist at all.  </p><p>      But nevertheless, the support was -- was -- as we see it today when something like this happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There was a good piece last week, I believe it was by Max Boot, who made the argument that the U.S. and NATO is, in effect, fighting the last war again; making that mistake of fighting the last war. That in this environment of hybrid warfare like you experienced in 2007 and see elsewhere today, that it's not about buying more littoral combat ships, right? That you need to focus on the right tools, whether they be offensive cyber weapons, et cetera.  </p><p>      Do you have a concern that that's the case; that folks are looking backwards as opposed to forwards? Especially with Estonia that -- that by its very nature looks forward in terms of technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes. But first of all, just because you have newer kinds of risks doesn't make the old kind of risks disappear, unfortunately.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  If it were that, I would be extremely happy and maybe even welcome these new risks which are geographic (ph) in nature, because then, of course, our geopolitical seismic (ph) region will not be anymore geopolitically seismic (ph) because globally we are.  </p><p>      And it's only partly a joke, but if you think seriously where Russia is ahead of us -- we know that NATO is stronger than Russia. But if you look at, let's say, eastern border of NATO and conventional capacities, then Russia has considerable might there.  </p><p>      If you now think that you are -- you are seeing what is happening to our country's economy and technological development, because while Russia is very proud about Ukrainian sanctions and its own counter-sanctions by which Russia doesn't buy agriculture products anymore from European market, that it is now an independent -- well, independently able to feed its own population, then this is wonderful. You are primary sector exports (ph) and you are great agrarian country, 21st century.  </p><p>      Something's missing. Technology's missing.  </p><p>      Russia is losing out on technology development because of our sanctions big time. I'm quite sure that if Georgia never happened, Russia would be part of the Horizon 2020 European R&amp;D program, because Georgia, for example, is participating in that program.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  So they must see that they're losing in their might. I mean, it's not so big country, it's not economically well off, and its prognosis is bad, so -- and you still have some conventional advantages somewhere, globally.  </p><p>      I think this is particularly the time when you need to be vigilant in your analysis and in your response to be able to deter, if there were to be a sudden attempt to try to turn the tables.   </p><p>      Therefore, we cannot neglect conventional risks, even if there are new risks. And I think it's more true today than, maybe, it was, I'd say, 10 years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  You raise a point, which is something of a contrarian point of view here in the U.S., that -- that the perception that Russia is winning is misplaced; that, in fact, they're paying a very high cost in economic terms, technological terms.  </p><p>      You know, if you -- if you -- you know, to echo, to some degree, as you did, Senator John McCain, Russia's a gas station, right? You know, the -- the -- you know, it's still basically a petrol economy. Not great to -- to travel...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  What's that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well, nowadays, which is fine.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      You have to give a country credit it deserves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Big picture, do you -- are you making an argument that Russia's losing strategically?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes. Strategically, Russia is losing. And, therefore, I think we need to take this very seriously -- what their analysis of the situation might be.   </p><p>      What -- when will the window of opportunity of turning the tables suddenly on us close? We don't know this. We don't know what's the analysis, and we don't know, also, on a technical level, when is the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Turning the tables meaning a catastrophic attack meant to...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Something going really wrong, yes. In conventional sphere, in somewhere else -- something like Salisbury -- I mean, we didn't -- if somebody had told you two months ago that this would happen, would you have thought it's probable? No. So I think we need to be very vigilant right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Do you -- do you envision that -- again, I'm asking you to predict, which I know that no politician likes to do. But -- but are you speaking in the cyber sphere? Are you speaking in the kinetic sphere, or -- could be a whole range?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I'm speaking in cyber sphere. And I think, Russia aside, we need to think much more seriously how we treat, internationally, the risks stemming from -- from the cyber, and also from the fact that we have more and more self-learning systems.  </p><p>      And, also, I think we should think about -- that maybe Elon Musk and (inaudible) and others -- that they're right about A.I. And they put the probability of having A.I. at 50 percent at 2050. Well, I take this with -- pinch of salt, because I have a degree in genetic engineering.  </p><p>      And, when I was starting in university in '90s, then, everybody was sure that we would clone people by 2010. And we are very, very far from that. So I don't know whether we should take it seriously. But at least I know this:  that we can create systems which are self-learning and pretty autonomous, looking like A.I. to most people.   </p><p>      So we should actually understand what new kinds of risks stem from that. And I particularly love the -- the example of an -- of an -- close-to-A.I. or even A.I. war -- means (ph) somebody's nuclear system -- doesn't matter whose -- it -- this could be the system of an axis of good or an axis of bad. Doesn't matter, really.   </p><p>      But imagine you have a war, and it's in somebody's system, and it's self-learning, and we sent it into the system thinking that we know what it will find as equipment (ph) -- the software in that system -- and then it finds something unexpected. For example, somebody has taken a contaminated computer to the system -- very common thing. Somebody read (ph) internet on the same computer, then connected it to some technical system.  </p><p>      And this, our A.I. little war now (ph), reads this information. And this changes our understanding, because we thought it will only read and learn about the system, but he (ph) read a piece of news. And this piece of news said that United Nations getting ready to ban A.I. for military use.  </p><p>      And this system is in the nuclear element, and it knows it is A.I., and it knows the system where it is is military. What will happen? And it's not as science fiction as -- as it sounds. Maybe this particular example still is, but I use it to explain that, I mean, we have loads of things which might come not necessarily from state and government actors.   </p><p>      Artificial intelligence, as far as we see now, will not be created by a public actor. It will created, probably, by somebody else. Where? We don't know. When? We don't know. We know it hasn't been created, because, according to the current technology development, it would eat so much energy that we would notice that somewhere, globally, energy is being used to this extent.  </p><p>      But it might happen. And we are not even discussing about how international law should apply, what should be our measures, counter-measures.   </p><p>      For example, we could agree, at the United Nations level, that, if we detect that energy somehow being used in a concentrated way somewhere, or that somebody has built a neural-network-like computer network somewhere, this would trigger an inspection.   </p><p>      Are we discussing it? No. We are only discussing the cyber, conventional, and failing even there to agree how exactly international law should apply in cyber sphere.  </p><p>      I think we are so far behind the curve of where we should be. And I think this is now urgent discussion which you should be having. But you don't have many takers, I have to say.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There's a great quote, and I don't -- I can't quote it from memory, that -- that Putin said at a conference last year about -- the country that controls A.I. will dominate in a number of ways. And then I often read that quote at speeches, and ask folks who they think said it. And they always say, \"Elon Musk,\" or something like that.  </p><p>      It's Putin. He's clearly thinking in these terms. Whose -- who, to our knowledge, is ahead on A.I.? China? Russia? The U.S.? Estonia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  My guess is that it's in private sector, not in government sector right now. But, indeed, what -- I noticed this quote, and I was very worried.   </p><p>      Because, normally, President Putin speaks -- he -- in his -- if we look back in retrospective -- I mean, all the discussion about geopolitical catastrophe of breaking down the Soviet Union, thereafter came tries to negotiate, then -- Georgia, et cetera -- sometimes you hear something -- well, we've heard very often, for example, that the Baltic states are very stupid to leave the Russian electricity grid, because, of course, it's very technically stable.  </p><p>      And the -- which is true, by the way. It is technically very stable. Yet, we know that he spent a lot of money to make sure that his structures will not suffer if we are pushed off the grid suddenly. Right now, this is not still possible, but it is (ph).  </p><p>      So this makes us to -- work with European Commission to make sure that we could be deconnected (ph) from -- from that grid as quickly as possible and connected to the European electricity grid even if, I mean, economically, it doesn't -- well -- make much sense to do this. But it's clear that, if you hear these things, you need to think about what that might mean.   </p><p>      Similarly, there was a call for respect, and then Salisbury. So, indeed, we need to pay attention that artificial intelligence, if it happens in -- somewhere, then we need to detect it quickly. We need to detect it quickly, especially in case it will be in the -- on the axis of bad, not on the axis of good. But my guess is it will be private sector.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  So now I'm going to ask you to predict again. You said that folks, you know, years ago, predicted we'd already be cloning dogs and cats and human beings, and we're not there yet. How many years or decades off do you think the breakthrough is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I cannot -- I'm not a specialist in that field. But, looking at -- again, at this benchmark of genetic engineering, then we cannot -- well, we can make bacteria with some characteristics which we wanted it to have; that's all. And we are eight years past the date we were supposed to clone human beings, so it might take time.  </p><p>      But this doesn't change the fact that -- I mean, autonomous systems, self-learning autonomous systems can mimic pretty closely something which is A.I. It will not be a -- a science fiction, but it -- it may be nevertheless as dangerous, or almost as dangerous. It's just that it's easier to predict what it thinks -- well, \"thinks\" in quotation marks of course.  </p><p>      But this example what I came about the war (ph) in nuclear system, this doesn't need to be A.I. It could be actually a -- a well-learning automated system just happening on the wrong piece of information.  </p><p>      My example was understandable for us, but we are talking machines there. There might be other technical data which is not understandable for us right now here, which will actually push it off the course, and we need to be ready for these kind of developments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  And -- and self-learning systems like that exist today?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes, we have self-learning systems playing really good board games, we know that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  For a digitized economy like Estonia, which has created, of course, many jobs and opportunities for its population, but of course technology, as we know, often replaces human jobs with -- with machines, et cetera.  </p><p>      Is -- is the approach of A.I. and -- and the existence of self learning something, you know, a rough equivalence today. What did that do to the future of work?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I think will do good to the future of work. First of all, already now we can see that the current mediocre level of technology was what the humankind is able to achieve is changing the work -- work already.  </p><p>      I mean, the fact that I can work from Tallinn for somebody in America, or in France or in Australia demonstrated people don't need enterprises anymore to get the best added value of their skills. They don't need broad skills; they can be extremely narrow skills, and -- and they could sell them globally because you can sell them online, which poses a huge question -- who will get the taxes? And without taxes, we will not -- we will not be able to help our people to pass this transfer.  </p><p>      Sometimes people think that the nature of the job will change only for well learned and educated people, but I think it is a great equalizing fact (ph), because you can -- you can actually be somebody who would (inaudible) something very classic, like handicraft, but you will be able to sell it globally.  </p><p>      We have in Estonia this -- this case where is (ph) a South African man living in a small county in middle of nowhere basically in Estonia, and he makes bows and arrows. They're really good, I've -- I've understood, because they sell globally for a high price. And -- but he just prefers to live where, I mean, his clients -- the closest client I think was more than 2,000 kilometers away.  </p><p>      So, an example, and even for handicapped people, let's imagine you have an -- well an autistic person who is ready to knit socks, but only red ones, probably in his vicinity he wouldn't find enough takers, and since he's incapable to socialize, he cannot sell. But online and globally probably he finds enough, I mean, these people who love just these red socks. So you can sell and -- and you can have a job. And previously, such a person would have been unemployed.  </p><p>      So there are numerous ways of how they -- well the work is changing. And what I hate most is that let's tax robots and pay subsistence fees to people. And it always takes me back to the change from agricultural economies to industrial. What if we had taxed tractors and paid subsistence fees to agricultural workers who lost their jobs? Would they have taken up industrial jobs? They wouldn't. And I admit that this transfer was extremely painful, but it was painful because we didn't have social systems and dedication.  </p><p>      So now our difficult equation is actually how to keep our social systems and dedication going when the traditional tax system is obviously going with traditional work system. We gathering every morning into an enterprise and working for (ph) the same enterprise, having home address and demanding services in one country globally. This is all going, and we've got to start talking about it right now.  </p><p>      And my understanding is that in future, our country will be hub for people, a (inaudible) kind of. I've (inaudible) Estonia, but it provides me (ph) social and educational services, my children online tutoring in Estonia language wherever they are globally, but it doesn't necessitate me to have a postal address in Estonia or something. It's a deal between me and this country.  </p><p>      And the problem of course is that if we are lazy in this thinking, then either we lose these services or they will all get privatized, which will actually lower their inclusivity, which might not be a problem for you here in America, but definitely for us in Europe, because our people expect us to provide a kind of school system, health system, health care system, which is available to almost (ph) everybody. So we are much more afraid of -- of these kind of developments, that (inaudible) tax base. But if we are rigid and say to people that unless you do it the old-fashioned way, we don't provide you with services, then they will opt out and go private, or simply go without, and then try to opt in, because only pension system penalizes late opt in. Health-care system does not penalize late opt in in any way; educational system for our children either.  </p><p>      I mean, we need to figure it out, because otherwise we will lose the best proportion of earnings tax wise from the younger population.  </p><p>      And if you look globally, U.K., Netherlands, Estonia, the number of independently working people is already radically grown, so I'm not talking about tomorrow; I'm talking today. And we need to really think about globally and internationally what to do about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  This is happening as we have -- we have a crisis of confidence in a whole host of institutions here in the U.S. I'm a member of the fake news media. You heard the president standing next to you make a reference to fake news yesterday.  </p><p>      But it's affecting our technology companies as well. I mean, Facebook's position in the -- in the wake of Russian interference in the election. How much of a challenge is that? Do you see any similar loss of confidence or fear of big tech in Estonia, and if not, how -- how have you avoided that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  We feared Facebook as everybody else, of course. It's pretty obvious, but the difference is we have alternatives to Facebook. We have secure internet communication channels as well.  </p><p>      And I've ran around the globe for a year and a half telling everybody that this is unfair that governments have left people and businesses in internet without governmental support, because in the real world or (inaudible) world, you don't imagine that you cannot identify the other person with whom you are talking or interacting or contracting, at least at that point -- at least you would ask for a passport. You don't board a plane without knowing that everybody has dutifully shown up their passports. So we know with whom we are flying all the time.  </p><p>      For some reason, governments have failed to notice that their people and their businesses are in internet, and it's a big part of every transaction and quite a lot of communication change is online.  </p><p>      And I think governments have exactly the same obligation in the digital sphere to provide people with identification. Estonians have had this way of establishing safe corridors in internet to communicate, because using your digital identity also will create an encrypted channel. So it is failsafe, and, second, you know with whom you're talking. And this kind of internet connection is not dangerous, so our people are not afraid of using -- of using digital signatures, but of course, they also worried about somebody taking their data on Facebook.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  And also we can differentiate. We know this. It's -- it's weird, but, well, I know people have fun with -- with these kind of things. For example, one of my friends heard this. Somebody told that, in Estonia, there exists a -- well, an ear (ph) doctor, and his name is -- is Dr. Ear (ph). So he -- she wanted to check whether this is really true, and she Googled, and, for two months, she afterwards got all kinds of ear remedies, hearing devices, these kind of advertisements.  </p><p>      So people automatically assume that this is OK for kind of consumer services. But, for some reason, they didn't realize that, if this is going on, then, of course, this is going on also for political debate.   </p><p>      And our people, since they can differentiate between safe and unsafe internet a little bit better -- because we have safe one, as well, and we are not forced to use the unsafe one if we don't want to -- then I think they are a bit more resilient than people elsewhere.   </p><p>      Yet they are afraid, of course, and they simply don't use Facebook, in that case, of course, if they are afraid. Nobody would, anyway, contract over (ph) Facebook. I don't know. That would be weird, so.  </p><p>      Also, I've noticed that, in Estonia, people pay for internet time. If they have transacted and signed a contract, then you don't use a credit card for payment, but you use safe channel. You go to a bank, log in online and make an online payment. It doesn't take much longer, but is much safer. People prefer this and consider this safer than using credit cards online.  </p><p>      But they do it because it's as comfortable. If it were more comfortable, or not possible, comfortably, to pay -- you'd need to walk to bank office, for example -- then, they would use credit cards. So it has to be.   </p><p>      The -- the good internet has to be comfortable and available, and it starts from identification. I cannot repeat this often enough. It's our obligation as -- as governments to realize people have to have safe identification means in the internet sphere, as they have in real life.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  You have the advantage of having a genetic engineering degree, so -- very aware of -- of the health implications of a highly digitized society, particularly as it relates to privacy.   </p><p>      In light of what you were just discussing, social media, et cetera, how do you -- how do you handle those? Because, of course, no one is more concerned about their privacy than when it comes to -- to health information.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I think all Estonian politicians always ask this question from all audiences:  Do you know who read your doctor's notes last? Was it your doctor, or somebody you don't know? When we in Estonia -- if somebody reads our -- I don't know, tax declaration, health information -- you know.  </p><p>      But, I mean, sometimes people think that Estonia is -- is a kind of wild world of -- world of internet. It isn't. It's actually a much stronger regulated world of internet. Our government has given people numerous guarantees that they will know if somebody's -- looks around in their data.   </p><p>      We also gather genetic information of all our people. It's another legally permissive environment -- result of Estonian way of having a state. We -- we know much more of our -- our people's, well, genetic data -- common markers for common ailments (ph).   </p><p>      And we are enlarging this project, and -- and people are not afraid to participate, because state has given guarantees about how this data is to be handled. Even your doctor wouldn't see it if you don't want it. But then, probably, you don't want, first, to have this, and this is, of course, voluntary, whether you do or you don't.  </p><p>      So we have Estonian Genome Foundation, created at the same time as, more or less -- as the digital Estonia, and it's very similar in -- in what we did in digital. We probably have done other things, but they have not flied (ph). This flied (ph).   </p><p>      It flied (ph) for short term, from 2000 to 2003, because, you know, we created this environment where population and genetics was legal, and it wasn't in most countries, globally. It was in Iceland. Iceland was our only competitor, but, luckily, they have even tinier population. So, to do population genetics in a population of 300,000 is -- is more of a joke than doing it in 1.3 million, which is still a joke, but something.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      So private companies flocked in and paid for founding Estonia Genome Foundation. It was done on investment banking finance only. But then what happened? The governments came in. The other governments, entering (ph) the market, because they, of course, started to buy all these services, because, of course, companies were clever enough to say that you have to pay. It's not enough to create legal space.  </p><p>      And then, for 10 years, it was dormant until the technology became so cheap that, now, we can continue with -- with helping our people to understand the genetic risks of having heart attack, or diabetes II and other of these common ailments.  </p><p>      But, again, very often, people ask, then, that \"Are you afraid of\" -- and we say no, because we know that this data is protected. The state knows how to protect data. And -- and it's in -- it's still in my ownership.   </p><p>      I mean, yes, it is in some kind of a database, but I own it. It's not state's. It's mine, and I decide who uses it, and how. Personally, I don't mind if you know that my diabetes II risk is higher, and it is. But that's fine with me, so I can tell it openly.  </p><p>      And I think it's important we work on these areas, as well, because 90 percent of the world's population, when they feel sick, what do they do first? Google. Nowadays, what you have on Google is mostly rubbish medical information.   </p><p>      But you need to have solid alternatives for people. So medical doctors need to have access to people's data -- of course, without names and everything, so -- to analyze and create self-learning medical doctors who are able to respond to people.  </p><p>      NHS in Great Britain is experimenting, actually, that, if people call in the emergency line, and it's established that, in fact, it's not an emergency, then they are trying, with -- with a robot, to try to, well, direct this person to go to pharmacy or to go to doctor or whichever way.   </p><p>      But these systems have to have databases to learn. And donating your information to them -- health information or genetic information -- in an anonymous format is a great thing to do for humanity. But it needs to be safe, and it can be safe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  But -- but how could you -- I guess the issue is, even with regulation, the question becomes confidence, right, and confidence in security, because I'm someone -- and listen, I -- I have such a baseline level of -- of digital knowledge, but -- but I have an assumption -- and this is partly because of the work that I do, but I -- also, I lived in China -- I have assumption that there is no actual privacy, because I've been a victim of -- of three or four -- of the three or four biggest hacks:  the OPM hack, the Anthem Healthcare one, and I forget what the other one -- I've lost track.   </p><p>      I have so many free digital ID services paid for by various entities that mishandled my information, I -- I don't even know. So how do you get those two to come together? Because you could have that knowledge, but, without confidence, then, you know...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First thing first. This is the big problem of developing digital country like Estonia:  Lots of digital services provided online, indeed, with identification ways -- I don't know. You use some username and some code, and then you write it on your computer, have a special file in your computer, et cetera. It's unsafe, terribly unsafe.  </p><p>      Or take a very -- it's a concrete example. I got it from Rudy Giuliani -- or I put the example together, but I learned from him. E-prescription's pretty popular in United States, but it's an e-mail. I'm sorry.   </p><p>      And, when something goes wrong with this e-mail, e-prescription, then confidence in all e-prescriptions is down the drain, including ours. But our e-prescription system is much safer. You -- you can never say it's absolutely safe, but it's definitely safer than paper analogs (ph), so I'm quite sure I call it safe.   </p><p>      But, when something goes wrong in one service, people lose trust in others. And that is where we need to go up (ph) the confidence and trust of all our people, constantly explaining to our people where we differ.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  We are not, I mean, holding this to (ph) ourselves. Actually, we very much like to expand our -- our X-Road, what we call, which is our identification system.  </p><p>Finland is using the same, and we can change real -- real-time data with them. We don't, because we haven't sold it legally, but, technically, we already can, if -- for example.  </p><p>      So we are open to others to use ours or similar systems. We are not telling that you cannot do it. But, if you come with us into this world, you have to take responsibility to -- explaining to your people how these services work.   </p><p>      And, in addition, you have to promise that you make some promises to your people about how -- and then you have to apply this in your law base (ph) -- how you use this data, how you protect this data, what is your obligation vis-a-vis your people in case you have this data.  </p><p>      For example, I would absolutely refuse to distribute our X-Road's technology to a company for -- which I knew that it has, let's say, only one single database where it tends to gather all the information about its citizens, et cetera.  </p><p>      But, I mean, if you do it in a smart -- smart and sharp way, and protect this, also, legally, what you are doing, and protect your people, it can be done, not only in Estonia, but all that's following (ph). Denmark is quite good example, Luxembourg is quite good example. We are small, but it's something.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Before -- I do want to go to the audience soon -- I do want to ask you about blockchain, because I know this is at the top of your list of interests.  </p><p>      Is the -- and, just out of curiosity, and you know far more than me -- but the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble, or at least the volatility there -- is that a just a bump on the road towards all the potential of blockchain technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Well, do we want to talk blockchain or Bitcoin? Let's agree on that first?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  It's an example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Totally bad example. Let's take, then, Bitcoin.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And, for Bitcoin, you don't need to be a -- a well -- well-established macroeconomists to understand that money needs economy, and a link to a real economy. Then you know whether you have too much money, too little money, is it overvalued, undervalued -- all this.   </p><p>      I ask you, where's the underlying economy of Bitcoin? There isn't. Or, if there is, then we cannot measure it; therefore, we cannot understand what's the value of Bitcoin. This much about Bitcoin -- I mean, this is an illusion.   </p><p>      This has an interesting afterthought, if I think more about the Bitcoin situation. A well-known A.I. example says that A.I. is dangerous because it will make the world into paper clips. And then people say, \"No, no. A.I. will not be so stupid as to make the world into paper clips.\"  </p><p>      And I've also thought that maybe it wouldn't. But, now, I mean, we are not A.I. We are human beings, and we mine Bitcoin. We spend real-life resources to the detriment of our environment -- lots of energy, et cetera, and other resources -- to mine something which has absolutely no value. So, I mean, where exactly are we better than A.I., here, in this problem?  </p><p>      Now, to blockchain, this is different thing. Blockchain is a technology which allows different systems to keep track about what different systems around it, with which it is connected, are doing. And we think this is very useful technology.   </p><p>      It's -- it's one step forward from what we have, because our digital signature, for a normal person, would look pretty much like blockchain, because it's signature and it's timestamped. It's similar enough for experts to look for the authors (ph) of Bitcoin in Estonia, but it's not the same technology.  </p><p>      So blockchain allows -- for our case, we think it will allow our state to go proactive in offering services. How? Right now, we still have to apply for state digital services, one by one. For example, you have a child. You register the birth, then you apply for social services.  </p><p>      But our people are starting to ask this question that -- I mean (ph), \"Government, you promised you would only ask once. Now, you have the information that I have a baby, and we are entitled to a certain payment for this baby.\"  </p><p>      It's not relevant how much you earn, we have universal child support in Estonia. \"So why on earth, government, you now force me to apply, even if I can do it online? Why I need to go to some home page and, I mean, ask for this service? You can simply provide it to me. I have a baby. You know my bank account, because it's -- I pay taxes. And you know I'm entitled to this money. So why should I ask?\"  </p><p>      And the answer is, because we don't have blockchain. Our systems do not have the capacity to make sure that -- I mean, one system -- what one system is doing -- that something's not going wrong at the same time at -- in the different system. Blockchain will help us to solve this problem.  </p><p>      Our pilot is not social -- social security, because this is a high-confidence-level-demanding service. Our pilot there is traffic accident -- simple traffic accident, which happens every day. I mean, two cars get a little bit ruined. It's an insurance case. And we think that we -- by using blockchain, we can solve it in 30 minutes -- all the administrative questions.  </p><p>      So you register your traffic accident. We have, of course, online car registry, and all these elements are there -- online insurance, full database of insurance schemes, et cetera. So we could, actually, in 30 minutes, we think, send information to both parts (ph) of the accident, and -- about how this incident was solved.   </p><p>      But, for this, we need to have blockchain, which makes us also to think that -- when is the point when we need to create a legal entity for an -- learning -- or a machine learning system, or a machine system? And we feel we are coming quite close to this point. So we are now discussing exactly with -- how to regulate -- how to regulate, well, autonomous systems in our law base.  </p><p>      Attribution questions will rise. And then, of course, it will be an interesting question. I think I read it this morning in one Estonian daily (ph) -- it -- lawyers were discussing that, if a robot kills somebody, then how do we know that the robot did not get the order from its owner to kill somebody, but simply went crazy?   </p><p>      And, I mean, it's -- it's not -- I mean, it's not a laughing matter. This is the questions we need to solve. And also, for our -- this proactive state, we need to solve this question, and, yet again, we need to solve the question of privacy.   </p><p>      People probably need to somehow opt in to this kind of system, understanding and analyzing, themselves, whether they want to use or they don't want to use this.   </p><p>      So it's not easy, but we are thinking forward and we are forced to think forward, because, exactly, people are asking, \"You know this. Why do I need to apply at all?\" It's people who want this.   </p><p>      And government, once it has undertaken this digital disruption of society, cannot back off. You have to continuously, all the time, first of all, make sure that the existing systems are still safe to use, that you can patch them up if something goes wrong and that you can continue developing.  </p><p>      And it is also true that, sometimes, things go wrong. We have at least two means of identification online. Yesterday, for two hours, one of them was down. The other was working. So we need to have alternatives. But the problem with our country is that you cannot have digital with paper alternative. You have to have digital with digital alternative.  </p><p>      And -- and we had this problem last year, where there is a chip maker, whom I wouldn't name, but maybe some of you know, which actually called 1 billion chips off the market, said that they aren't safe to use.   </p><p>      Most of these were door cards (ph). High number was actually ID cards, but mostly in the countries which -- where people have IDs, but don't use them. So they could be simply, well, shut down for a while.  </p><p>      We couldn't do it. For us, it was right that (ph) the service continues, because our people refused it otherwise. They wouldn't go to offices to queue for services.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  They even got really angry that -- because some of them finally -- most of them could solve the problem online, but some couldn't. And they had to go to a police or border guard office. And then, we got loads of complaints that -- oh, kidding (ph), I had to queue for an hour. And I mean, and then you explain to people that people in Western Europe normally take a day off to register their car.  </p><p>      So this is where you have your population, and this also demonstrates to you that whatever Estonian government wants you to do -- go completely back to paper-based system for example -- it simply cannot. Disruption has happened, and now you have to live with the consequences and work forward to make sure that you are actually -- well, continuing to provide services to your people, to their satisfaction.  </p><p>      Which means that even we are on the Mars already, our people want us to be even further. I mean so, Earth for them is not the solution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  So wait, should we buy up block chain, or -- I wasn't clear. I'm joking.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I got the answer loud and clear. OK, so we're going to go to the -- to the assembled audience here for questions. I think we have about a half hour. Gentleman in the back with his hand raised? And there are -- yes, there are microphones.  </p><p>      Please if you can, identify yourself. And the other guidance I always give is phrase it in a question rather than a statement or a speech.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Michael Shraig (ph) with MIT.  </p><p>Estonia is a very small country, as you pointed out. China, huge country. United States, huge country. Key to making machine learning work is scale. You're a small -- you're a scientist, you're from a small country, but you deal with giants and behemoths.  </p><p>      What's the most important thing you've learned about managing scale in an environment where petabytes and zettabytes is the future of what you're talking about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First thing to realize is indeed that scale wise, we don't create technology. We use technology quite common in private sector globally, so we don't have to carry the cost, and we fully understand that we don't control the delivery chain of this technology.  </p><p>      And this is why we need to make sure we're using, let's say, these digital chips, that we also have mobile I.D., for example, because we simply don't control the technology. But this is what makes it available.  </p><p>      If you now look more locally in Estonia, then since we've had absolute inclusivity, this digital chip is part of our I.D. card, with which we travel as well, at least within the European Union. Then this inclusivity from the other side is (inaudible). So for local services actually, companies have it quite good. They have the 1.3 million market at least, immediately at their hand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Gentleman here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I thank you for your comments today. Two questions, one -- are (ph) there related. One is recently Estonia joined a number of other countries, including the U.S., in condemning the NotPetya worm and attributing it to Russia.  </p><p>      This is always a delicate question when you have this kind of collective response. What -- attribution the other day is a -- is a, you know, political issue. What level of confidence do you need, does Estonia need, to join that kind of collective because it's more powerful?  </p><p>      And then on Russia, what kinds of actions would you think would be effective in actually deterring their behavior in cyberspace? You said that we need to do more. McMaster said that last night. What kinds of things would actually work?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  In cyberspace, we need monitoring, and we need to agree that international monitoring is allowed, and that there will be elements and events which will trigger international monitoring, very similarly as you have with (ph) sensitive nuclear technology globally. We need to agree what it is.  </p><p>      I give you a few examples. Radical shift in energy consumption in some laboratory or somewhere is one thing. Second is now we understood that we need to create the, like, neural networks to be able to think of A.I. which will not consume so much energy that it will be dead immediately. These could be regulated. This is hardware after all. This could be regulated that you need to allow international monitoring, and this -- well, we need to bring in globally all countries. Because as I said, it's not anymore enough like in the nuclear case, that some countries agree and the rest will simply, well, accept because they don't have the weapons. It's global, and we don't know where it will -- where it will happen. So this much for regulation.  </p><p>      For confidence level, it's not quantitative; it's always qualitative analysis, and depends -- well it very much, you have to go case by case.  </p><p>      But it's interesting that we're joining (ph), because for us it's a solidarity act, because NotPetya didn't pass in Estonia, only in one international company system, which was not linked to Estonian system. Pure (ph) act of solidarity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Is there a mic?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Yeah, it's coming.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Fran Burwell from the Atlantic Council.  </p><p>      Two questions. First off, when you are thinking about how to deter or respond to an attack, does it matter if it is a nation-state behind it, or whether it is organized crime, or is it the same response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Same.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  And -- OK. And the other thing is, you raised the issue of taxes. But your approach to tax sounds a little bit different for me from what has been proposed by some E.U. governments, including in terms of taxing digital enterprises, which, as you're well aware, some people here fear is aimed primarily at some large U.S. companies in Europe. Can you be a little bit more specific about where you think taxes should go to counter this -- to deal with this new world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I can be a little bit more specific. Fully aware that first of all, I am in -- I'm in contradiction with much of the European thinking, plus OSCE (ph) rules, everything. So we absolutely need to modify international space, and we cannot go alone. So we need to first understand that, I mean, we have this problem, and then we need to start seeking solutions. And voluntary declaration of (inaudible) with any chosen state would be actually something, which probably is the -- is the solution to the problem. And I realize I'm -- that we are very far from -- from getting there.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, Europe is doing what they always do in these kinds of systems. You apply a patch, and then you see what you can do to solve -- solve the problem as it is. And I think applying patches meanwhile to make sure that society is at least accepting that, I mean, we do need to tax differently, just because internet exists, is -- is a step in right direction. Of course it can be inhibitive to -- to some investment and so on. And I'm not necessarily supporting it, but I see where it comes from politically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Gentleman standing in the back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I'm Basil Scarliss (ph). I've been involved in foreign affairs.  </p><p>      And I have a question on sanctions. Perhaps a good way to deter Russian cyber attacks and other meddling and military action would be to have a more effective regime for punishing the Russian leader and the oligarchs.  </p><p>      And one obstacle is that in the United States, and to some extent in the United Kingdom, we allow shell companies to purchase properties, to make investments in corporations and in other organizations without revealing the beneficial owner; they can hide behind an attorney.  </p><p>      The question I have, is do you think it would be much more effective to have targeted sanctions, especially if we could get Congress to pass appropriate legislation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Simple answer would be yes.  </p><p>      Then the political answer would be doesn't concern me, because Estonia doesn't have that much oligarchic money in the country. It's a tiny economy, completely transparent as well, because digital makes it also transparent.  </p><p>      And -- and the practical answer is that I think yes, but we must make sure that we remain rule-of-law countries while we do it, as well. This is very important.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  If I could follow on that, this issue comes up -- it came with the response to Skripal attack -- that the next level would have been true financial penalties for people in power.  </p><p>      You'll often hear -- whether with Ukraine, U.S. election interference -- about going after Putin's money, whether freezing it or exposing it to -- to his people -- all of his various holdings around the world.  </p><p>      Why hasn't that happened yet, in your view?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I simply don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Good answer.   </p><p>      There's a group of folks here, but maybe I'll just go from the forward, back. There's a gentleman, and then behind two, and we'll go from there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hans Binnendijk from SAIS. First of all, let me say it's so refreshing to hear a president be able to converse the way you do on these issues.   </p><p>      I'd like to ask about Russian attacks using social media. This is below the denial-of-service level. What has been your experience -- not just in Estonia, but in a -- in the Baltic States in general -- with regard to Russian use of social media to try to affect the opinions of your minorities -- Russian-speaking minorities?  </p><p>      What have you been able to do about that? I presume you're countering it. And what lessons do you have for us in this area?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First, Baltic states -- well, I cannot say we have seen more of these kind of attacks. I think Germany has had a fair share, and visa case (ph) -- every German knows it. And -- and Emmanuel Macron called Putin out on disrupting the French election processes.   </p><p>      We have been expecting and preparing for -- when EFP (ph) was established -- that we will have quite some. Lithuania had one, but the reaction was so quick -- retaliation from Lithuania -- to inform people that this is false news, to make sure that everybody got it -- it was false news -- was so good.  </p><p>      But we've actually not seen any further elements. But we are, of course, ready all the time. And the only way to be ready is to tell your people this exists. We talk about troll factories. We show people that they do exist. And, frankly, try to read anonymous internet commentary under some article about -- I don't know, I do it under my articles about myself.  </p><p>      I recognize a troll writing quite soon. They are trying to put a message out about you, which comes whichever way -- I mean, it -- it comes. And you have a few -- few kind of names which always will appear. And then you learn to recognize it.  </p><p>      And -- and people, having live in -- lived a long time in the internet sphere, learn to understand this. Of course, we all have a big problem that most of the population is not able to differentiate between journalism -- something which pretends to be journalism and -- and something which think it is journalism, because they are -- well, I think those people who don't realize that they are not journalists, but they do -- don't do it in bad will.  </p><p>      And, previously, I expected journalists to check their facts when they provide them to me. For some reason, I cannot do it, and I think here is also a frank discussion to be had, because lots of fakes new -- fake news will die if people knew that the safe channels will never pick them up. Yet safe channels stay after they (ph) pick them up.  </p><p>      And we need to radically think how to avoid this. First of all, we all need to start paying for our online news, and then we can continue this discussion. I'm sorry it starts with that. Currently, the media sector has no resources to deal with it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There's a couple questions coming in from Twitters (ph). So, Madam President, this one is, \"We have an obligation to explain the issues around privacy and responsibility to citizens,\" relevant to what you were just discussing. \"How has Estonia brought citizenry to a level where they can understand the explanation?\"  </p><p>      And I'm -- I could identify with this, because, I'm sure, like you, you agree to terms that you don't know or read what those terms are, frequently. And so how do you manage that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  We have only one set of terms, and this is state-guaranteed digital identity. It's not too much to ask people to understand one set of terms and conditions.   </p><p>      And the terms and conditions are roughly the same. You keep your identity -- physical one -- separate from the passwords. And, if this, for some reason, was not the case, you run quickly or go online quickly somewhere where you can, well, just close your identity.  </p><p>      This is the basic drill. But we have to do it only one copy, because we have the universal system. And that is how we can build trust. And, of course, it is -- government is on the line.   </p><p>      It's government which is giving this currently. It's not Google or Amazon or -- or somebody anonymous or not in your country. And I'm sorry -- it wouldn't get better unless more governments take this responsibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) gentleman in the beard, and then -- well, actually, you both have beards. So...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      ... we'll just have to go to -- left to right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hey. Matt Leonard with Government Computer News.   </p><p>      Can you talk briefly about the data embassy that you guys opened up last summer, what its current role is and any plans for opening up other data embassies, going forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  There's not much to talk about. It's a simple thing. Every private enterprise has a safe copy of everything it has, and, if the country's legal base allows it, has it outside of the country.  </p><p>      Now, we have a copy of Estonian state, every minute, every moment, in -- in a data embassy. And, since it is state and state data and we need to make sure that our law base about this data and what applies to this data will apply to where it is, we cannot simply establish a server somewhere.   </p><p>      We need to have an agreement with Luxembourg, also a very digitally minded and forward-looking country, that we will create a data embassy. So this server park (ph) is a sovereign territory of Estonia, and these servers and this data is -- belong to Estonian state. And, again, there is nothing technologically interesting.  </p><p>      Interesting thing is law space, which we two together created, between Luxembourg and Estonia. Whether we need to have more copies -- well, time will tell. But I am quite sure that people would -- would be quite happy to host Estonian data embassy.   </p><p>      On the other hand, other states need data embassies too. So -- they all have data which they need to store.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  And just -- I'm curious. Are those updated constantly, then? Because, if my -- my -- if I'm an insurance company, I don't know -- today's data is different from next week's data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes. As I said, all Estonian digital signatures are timestamped. So, in this sense, they are like blockchain, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  And then did you (ph) -- if you still have a question -- the gentleman here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Grigory (ph) (inaudible) of Russian news agency. So, first question, how -- do you think Estonia needs more NATO (ph) troops to deter Russia? And, if so, how many troops do you need?  </p><p>      And the second one is about Skripal poisoning. So Estonia expelled a Russian diplomat, and -- but British experts said yesterday that they don't know a region of the agent that poisoned Skripal and his daughter.  </p><p>      So do you -- do you still believe your actions to expel Russian diplomat was justified? And do we (ph) have any evidence of Russian involvement in these poisoning? Or this is just a matter of solidarity with European countries?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  As most countries trace (ph) -- they didn't send out simply diplomats. They sent out diplomats who were acting in a way as diplomats shouldn't act. So there was another reason for -- for this concerted action.  </p><p>      What -- what concerns NATO troops, then -- NATO deterrence is -- well, has a history of being 100 percent efficient and effective. NATO has never failed to protect its territory. And it's -- in its entirety.  </p><p>      And we trust into this capacity to deter. And we're quite sure that all NATO steps are always adequate to make sure that this deterrence is -- is -- is valued.  </p><p>      In the summer, NATO summit will come together and discuss again those issues and these -- those elements. Our role there is to provide honest and open analysis of the security situation, considering conventional risks around our territory and among those -- well, is the information, which we have also talked publicly.  </p><p>      Today, the level of conventional capacity surrounding NATO's eastern flank is at the level of 2009 Zapad exercise. We need to draw conclusions from that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  In the far back here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p>      So, I've read that there are efforts to use blockchain technology in order to -- for example, in the Estonian stock exchange, to make voting easier and more secure and like it -- you know, immutable ledger and all that. You know, it's distributed.  </p><p>      There's also efforts in Australia to -- company called My Vote, I think, to utilize the -- you know, relatively secure and distributed immutable ledger to help voting. And I've also heard the idea for voter registries.  </p><p>      So I'm just curious, is Estonia considering using blockchain for voter database -- or yeah, voter registry databases, or e-voting -- like direct e-voting itself for candidates, or for referendums at the local level or at the larger level?  </p><p>      Because I've heard that. It's an interesting idea and Estonia seems to be a little bit on the cutting edge of using those technologies.  </p><p>      So yeah, just blockchain in voting systems basically is the question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Basically, we have e-voting and this system is tried and tested and free for everybody to try and hack. And voting is the highest confidence level digital service, so you change our voting technology only when you have tried and tested the new technology developments. And you have taught your people that this technology is safe.  </p><p>      On lower confidence level of services, voting should be the last which will shift technology, once you already have an established system of secure voting, which we have.  </p><p>      So I predict that all other Estonian public services will be blockchain based before our e-voting system will change.  </p><p>      And I always tell to other countries, some -- some countries would say, \"Let's start from e-voting.\" And I always say, \"That's a terribly bad idea. Start from school applications or something really -- well, low-worry services. Never start from e-voting.\"  </p><p>      You have to teach a population cyber hygiene first. You have to teach them to trust the system. And only then you should apply -- you should try to apply this technology to high-confidence level services like voting.  </p><p>      On the other hand, sometimes we get discussion that e-voting must be terribly unsafe. And it comes from people who vote by post, so beats me how this discussion can come up, but it does still come up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Well, it's a very common fear here, though. I think you would -- I can't imagine a -- and, of course, it's run by states here, but I can't imagine a state legislature who'd push hard for it today, because there is that lack of confidence.  </p><p>      Question from Twitter here:  \"Madam President, you speak about the need for government-mandated digital identity. Many people are concerned that this gives too much power to governments. Do you see a need for anonymous transactions? And if so, in what cases?\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Well, I'm -- in my character, I'm a simple housewifish politician, and -- and this philosophical question has been bothering me a long time now. Why people in free world trust their banks and Google and Amazon, but don't trust their government?  </p><p>      And I don't -- I don't know the answer, but I think we need to have some really good philosophers and social scientists analyzing this question.  </p><p>      It's not technology what they are mistrusting. They are not trusting, for some reason, their government. I don't know why.  </p><p>      It may be different in every society. There may be similarities. I come from a society where people trust government in this sense. They don't trust it for, I don't know, having -- having a good tax system, or actually our people are very, very critical about our -- our government. It's a national tradition to think we are a badly run country.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I'm not joking. I mean, in 1943, the chairman of the Bank of England, Lord Wedgwood, he said that Estonia was the best-run country in northern Europe. And then one of our politicians said that the other diplomats told him that, and it's astonishing how little your people appreciate it.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      It's still the same.  </p><p>      But they trust government when government provides digital services.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There's a gentleman here along the aisle, and then we'll go to the back. I think we're getting down to probably the last question or two.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  All right, thank you. Johnathan Lynchman (ph) from the Providence Group.  </p><p>      You've mentioned a couple of times about educating the public, cyber hygiene. And I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what Estonia does with respect to public education on cyber-security and public information, in terms of making sure that it's both effective and that it reaches everyone.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Well, teaching hygiene is not as effective as, I don't know, applying some social services. It never will be, because if you think about when we taught people simple hygiene, it was also a lengthy process which gradually reached our people's brains. That you have to wash hands, otherwise you will fall sick; or you have to use toilets, because it's not hygienic to just go to the wood.  </p><p>      And it took us time. But I think we have nowadays much better communication means to teach our people cyber hygiene.  </p><p>      And the truth is, we have to start from this and many people haven't done it. Technology will not solve it. There will never be a technology which will be able to cover for all human errors. The only way is to tell people that, \"You are responsible.\"  </p><p>      And the way to do it is education. I mean, you have to teach people at school about the risks of internet. We have (inaudible) police which goes around the schools and teaches children. And it also teaches them that it's just -- I mean, if it's not nice to be rude toward, well, the other kids in class in real life, it's as rude in internet, et cetera. It starts from this low-level thing.  </p><p>      On the other hand, I recognize that most countries are now in bigger difficulty than Estonia, because we started teaching cyber hygiene at the turn of the century. And then the risk was some virus, and you just downloaded Kaspersky or something else. And -- and then it was cleared. Now you have to jump into the internet of things.  </p><p>      Yet saying that it's impossible doesn't -- I mean, doesn't solve the problem, so we have to try. And I think it has to go down to (inaudible) and primary education, this cyber hygiene teaching.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Oh, right here in the front. And then we'll go to the back, if that's OK. Sorry, I'm having you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I can -- I -- I'm pretty loud. I'm Claudia Jona (ph) from the Atlantic Council.  </p><p>      What is your take on the -- on the -- (inaudible) deadlock (ph) on the global discussion on cyber norms? What is your take on -- on why the discussion -- where it's where it is right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I'm disappointed that the process in United Nations fell through. And I'm quite sure that we need to revive it.  </p><p>      Estonia, among other things, have decided to run for United Nations Security Council, and we are in the active phase of campaign. And whether we win or we lose, this is in our talking points about discussing global security.  </p><p>      New Zealand took climate to the Security Council. We will take digital to the Security Council. And when we are elected, and we hope we will be, this is (inaudible) platform, definitely, and we need to continue.  </p><p>      There was a working group. Marina Coleron (ph) from Estonia was -- was -- was responsible for that work as well, and -- and we were deeply disappointed when this got stalled. But the problem has not gone away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  In the back, here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Madam President, Franica Jerka (ph), Broadcasting Board of Governors.   </p><p>      In this city, there is ongoing discussion how to counter Russian propaganda (inaudible). So my question is, do you believe the blocking of Russian TV channels, like it was made in Ukraine, like it will -- it will be in Moldova, in other countries, is an efficient measure? And the second question, do you think is it a good time for now, especially now, for Western countries -- United States, European Union -- to create, re-create, revive (inaudible) broadcasters like Voice of America or PRL (ph) in Baltic states or central European countries? Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I don't believe in restricting access to media outlets, even if I don't think they are free media outlets. I believe in telling my people that these are not free media outlets, so this is something which pretends to be media, or it's a government-run media. And we in Estonia, we do not restrict access to these media, yet we discuss this -- these channels and -- and everybody's free to choose whether, for example, to talk to them, and to -- how to react to them. But it needs to be known, and this is important.  </p><p>      But we need to not only think in the terms of Russia here. I think it would help everybody in this discussion to realize that the sources of fake news are numerous actually. I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty tough on Russia, but, I mean, sometimes I feel that people attribute all the problems in the global world to Russia.   </p><p>      Fake news can come from everywhere. There are various reasons for producing fake news, including somebody may simply want to sell their products, and -- and do away with somebody else's. I don't know. Somebody could say that Asics -- Asics running gear is -- is dangerous to your legs, and that doctors have analyzed and realized that because the first and -- and the back kind of padding are separate -- which is not the case for Nike running shoes -- it's dangerous.   </p><p>      So I mean, we have to analyze this in general, and need to teach our people how to check the facts. On the other hand, again, we need to get back a media space which we can trust somehow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  I think this -- well, let's see. Maybe we have time for two more up there quick. There's a lady here, and then someone who I keep forgetting to go to in the way, way back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Susan Ness, SAIS Center for Transatlantic Relations.  </p><p>      We talked extensively about the fake news issue. Also, within the European Union, there are efforts underway with respect to hate speech, to curtail that through government regulation. We'd like to know whether there is a major hate speech problem within Estonia, and if so, what role should government play in curtailing hate speech? Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First of all, I don't sense that we have a big hate speech problem in Estonia. Second, I think that good habits is something which you shouldn't always try to write into the law text, because if we do away with good habits, and only go by law, then we are not the humankind. We like it, and we want it. So I don't believe in regulating everything.  </p><p>      I think most people can recognize when it is hate speech. When -- when it goes to the territory that considerable losses are occurred (ph) to the other party by -- by something which has been said, then we have our court system, which can provide and solve (ph), even in the current legal space, for these cases. But I don't think that, well, you should legislate something you cannot define, really.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  So this will have to be the final one. And I can only see your hand, so I can't say -- oh, there you are.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi. How do you -- I mean, in terms of the ever-evolving capabilities of A.I., how long until you think machines will supplant the human workforce? And what will the workforce do with their newfound time? And I guess that's the end of my question.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I am a politician; I'm not clairvoyant. But first of all, we see already that technology does not only take away jobs, but it creates it as well. I gave you a few examples, how I think that actually handicapped people, people with high -- high home-work burden, like women with small children, they actually are much freer to act in the new technology world actively on the job market.   </p><p>      So good things are happening, and they're happening also to people with limited education and skills. For example, channeling YouTube may make quite good money, and it doesn't take a degree at all.  </p><p>      So new jobs are coming. I don't know where, but the important thing is that we should actually support this change, not try to hold it back. I'm quite sure that in 15 years' time, in industry, all the things we need will be made with the same proportional workforce, which is currently in agriculture, 3 to 4 percent of all workforce, not more. The rest will work elsewhere, and they will do something online. What exactly, who knows?   </p><p>      Some things we can see already, but I'm sure there will be much more new stuff emerging, which we cannot imagine right now. At least, I cannot.

Thank you for joining us today. I'm David Lashway, and I lead Baker McKenzie's cyber-security global practice. Delighted to have you all with us today.   </p><p>      Good morning, Madam President. Thank you for joining us. Damon Wilson and the folks from the Atlantic Council, thank you for hosting today with us. Jim Schiutto from CNN is here, as well, and will be carrying the day in the discussions later this morning. So thank you all.  </p><p>      Distinguished guests -- Mr. Chertoff, thank you for being here. It's good to see you and some old friends, Chris Boehner (ph) and others from the State Department. Thank you for joining us today.  </p><p>      Yesterday, Madam President, while at the White House, you reminded us of the blue, black and white of your flag and that you will always remember that it flew in -- here in America when it could not fly in Estonia, during 50 years of the 100 years that we celebrate during your visit today, due to occupation.  </p><p>      You reminded us, as well, of our partnership to confront challenges, and that that partnership is based upon three common things:  one, an understanding; two, the rule of law; and three, and perhaps most importantly, common beliefs. You said that we form the axis of the good based upon these.  </p><p>      We are proud to fly the blue, black and white of your flag here today, and we welcome you to the discussion to advance our common beliefs and understanding around cyber-security and other security risks, both in Estonia, in Europe more generally and here in the United States.   </p><p>      Marie Under, perhaps the most notable 20th-century Estonian poet, who lived during Soviet occupation and wrote of her experience, in her famous poem, \"Night,\" wrote, \"And, hand in hand, we walk uphill together.\"   </p><p>      I hope that, through the discussion today, we will go hand in hand through this discussion and through what will confront us in cyber in the days ahead.  </p><p>      And, finally, as we were just discussing this morning and as you mentioned yesterday, you reminded us Americans to reflect on the words that are carved in the granite monuments around our mall. That caused me to pause this morning and think for a moment of all the different statements that are carved across the mall that we look out on today.   </p><p>      And, on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death, no statement came to mind more than this -- perhaps one of the great American poets in Mr. King:  \"If we are to have peace on Earth,\" he said, \"our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class and our nation, and this makes us better. And, in common, we must develop a world perspective.\"  </p><p>      Thank you for sharing your perspective today. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to the discussion.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PAVEL</emphasis>:  Good morning, and welcome, everyone. I'm Barry Pavel. I'm a senior vice president at the Atlantic Council, and I direct the Scowcroft Center on -- on Strategy and Security there.   </p><p>      On behalf of the council, I'm really honored to -- to welcome you to our conversation with -- with President Kaljulaid of the Republic of Estonia, especially since this is her first public event here in Washington, D.C. And, Madam President, thank you so much for being -- for being here with us.   </p><p>      Again, I'd also like to welcome those of you who are following the webcast online. Please feel free to join the conversation on Twitter, using the hashtag #USBalticSummit, and the account @cyberstatecraft.  </p><p>      In today's discussion, we'll be touching on issues that -- that, in my view, will be key to the decade unfolding ahead of us, and those issues include artificial intelligence, blockchain and cyber-security, all matters on which President Kaljulaid has a strong voice and leadership, particularly given her presidency of a country undertaking what the New Yorker has called \"the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PAVEL</emphasis>:  Estonia has been at the cutting edge of the digital revolution since well before most of us were actually calling it a revolution.  </p><p>      By the late 1990s, all of Estonia's schools were online. And since then, it's gone digital on all its government services and set up data embassies outside the country to safeguard that information.  </p><p>      That's the kind of cyber foresight that we could use more of. And that's why we're so proud to have President Kaljulaid with us today.  </p><p>      At the Atlantic Council, we've redoubled our efforts toward fostering an international community of like-minded states and reinvigorating an adaptive set of global norms and rules built on common principles such as openness, transparency and the rule of law. Sometimes we do that the old-fashioned way through diplomacy and summits, but we're also passionate about innovating wherever useful and needed.  </p><p>      Estonia's project of digital statecraft, or e-Estonia, perfectly mirrors that spirit of much-needed innovation. By leveraging technology to transform everything from voting to citizenship, Estonia has shown us how to bring these tried and tested values forward into this century.  </p><p>      But of course introducing a digital -- digital element to governance also introduces risks, as Estonia itself knows very well from the cyber attacks of 2007. The very freedom and connectivity that makes our societies what they are, also opens us to malicious activities undertaken by those who oppose our values, as Lieutenant General McMaster outlined so passionately and eloquently before some of us at the Atlantic Council last evening in his final public remarks as national security advisor.  </p><p>      Estonia used the -- Estonia used the 2007 attack to turn its vulnerabilities into strengths, and it's now widely considered a global leader on cyber-security, with Tallinn hosting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.  </p><p>      But it underscores the need for us to devote real resources to protecting our increasingly information-based societies. And though we are already doing much to safeguard ourselves, as General McMaster said, much more work remains to be done on all fronts and in very close coordination with our allies.  </p><p>      And that's why at the Scowcroft Center we devote so many sustained efforts to strengthening cyber statecraft, working closely with key allies in every region of the world. And that's why we organize teams to visit the Baltics -- as we are doing next week, for example -- to engage more directly with our allies, to help shore up deterrence, defense and resilience against the foremost security challenges that we face.  </p><p>      And with that, let me introduce President Kaljulaid and our moderator, Jim Sciutto, to -- to speak to both the promise and peril of digital statecraft.  </p><p>      Before becoming the president of Estonia in 2016, President Kaljulaid served as a member of the European Court of Auditors from 2004 to 2016, where she organized the financial audit of E.U. R&amp;D funds, among many other leading responsibilities. She also was the economic adviser to the prime minister from 1999 to 2002, as well as CFO and CEO of the IRU power plant.  </p><p>      Leading our discussion today will be Jim Sciutto, chief national security correspondent of CNN; most importantly, a Villanova fan, for those of us from that area.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      With his extensive experience reporting overseas across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, we couldn't have asked for a better guide for this conversation.  </p><p>      He was the only American journalist to embed with U.S. special forces during the Iraq invasion, and he has reported undercover from inside Myanmar, and he reported Iran's first reaction to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union remarks.  </p><p>      Before we turn to Jim and Kaljulaid, I wanted to thank Baker &amp; McKenzie for hosting us today.  </p><p>      Thanks very much.  </p><p>      Thanks David Lashway, partner here at the firm, also for his continuous support of our cyber efforts at the Atlantic Council.  </p><p>      And now let's get to the good stuff. Thanks again. And I'll hand it over to our esteemed panelists.  </p><p>      Thank you very much.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Thank you for the kind introduction. Thanks so much to the Atlantic Council, Baker &amp; McKenzie, and -- and thank you, President Kaljulaid, for allowing me to sit across from you and throw a few questions your way.  </p><p>      I've had -- I've had the good fortune of spending some time in Estonia and interacting with -- with Estonian officials, interviewed foreign minister, as I've covered the Russian story and had some nice visits there as well. And I feel lucky for that. In fact, I spent my birthday last year in Estonia.  </p><p>      And as you know, it just -- it's a remarkable position, I think, in what has become a dominant national security line for the U.S., as a neighbor to Russia, as one of the first victims of a coordinated Russia cyber attack in 2007; really unprecedented but -- but foreshadowing of things to come.  </p><p>      And yet as a country, doubling down, all-in on the digitized society without hesitation and -- and with full confidence. And finding their (ph) way forward. Certainly a lot of lessons to be learned there, I think for -- for Europe for the U.S.  </p><p>      The subject today, of course, artificial intelligence, et cetera.  </p><p>      I do want to start, if I can, just in light of your visit here and your time yesterday in the White House, I'm curious, do you have confidence that the U.S. is a solid partner for you as you face challenges from Russia, particular cyber challenges from Russia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes, I have to say I have great confidence in this administration and in American people. And as I also said yesterday, this confidence is not (inaudible). It has (inaudible) in this common, shared values (ph) which we all have. And (inaudible) that, and I think it's pretty obvious that we can have confidence.  </p><p>      And I have to say that we've had really good cooperation with his administration (ph) since he took office. (Inaudible). Also (inaudible) -- for example, on nuclear weapons in 21st century, (inaudible) U.N. Security Council (ph) (inaudible) et cetera. So the contents are close and (inaudible). And this gives us confidence (inaudible). And it doesn't (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  If I could start on -- I want to get to artificial intelligence very quickly, but just on cyber, to describe to folks -- one thing that struck me when I was in Estonia is just the frequency of cyber attacks. This is -- this is a daily event, many times a day. These are the numbers of the way it works, right? It doesn't come in -- you know, in pairs or in dozens, it comes constantly.  </p><p>      How is it today? And -- and -- and where are the attacks coming from? How aggressive are they? And how do you push back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) just because you can't see this in the United States (inaudible). (Inaudible) you also have systems where (inaudible) and analyzed (inaudible) we also learned (inaudible) quite a number of them came from Russia (inaudible) Estonia. And this is how it is.  </p><p>      In most of the cases you don't allow it (ph). You just deter and (inaudible) but we don't analyze where it comes from, because they are (inaudible).  </p><p>      But (inaudible) or in case you see that someone is coming out (ph) (inaudible) systems, they're not (ph) (inaudible) analyze also where they came from.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  But in most of the cases, it simply doesn't give (inaudible) to deem this piece, because (inaudible) anyway and if it will not have a particular reason to -- to try to (inaudible). Then it just doesn't cooperate. It's just how cyber works, and I don't that it will ever change. This is how it is while...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  The outgoing national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, said last night that -- and he's not alone in this. You've heard this from many members of the administration, but also from folks outside -- that the U.S. and the West have not yet imposed sufficient costs on Russia to deter activity -- and not just cyber activity, other activity -- in Ukraine, et cetera. Do you agree with that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I think there is considerable space to improve. What has (inaudible) and which has come to many peoples' mind is to go off of the Russian money (ph) that don't perceive to go out to something which were very good. Most of the (inaudible) happened that the discussion was whether or not to throw Russia out of the international money transfer (inaudible), another option, for example, but I think actions need to be proportionate, and meanwhile it's also wise to say that we've been talking as well.  </p><p>      Talking all of this (inaudible) and understand this one is going to get as well (ph). (inaudible), this comes from only one source. This is the unit (ph), and we know that. We see it. We observe it very often that, for example, when there are attempts to break off from, let's say, all sanctions on Ukraine, then there is quite clever Russian persons assigned to understand where these attacks are going and trying to use this (inaudible) immediately.  </p><p>      And I would even say that quite often Russia goes where it thinks that this total (ph) result may be neglecting this part of Europe or region. I think this happened in Georgia. I think this happened in Ukraine. These countries were trying and -- were trying to come closer to Europe for some time, and obviously Europe (inaudible) to provide (inaudible) and clear opportunity and possibilities on how to come (inaudible) members (ph). So we saw that things went wrong.  </p><p>      And actually at the same line, in my mind (inaudible). Maybe there was an understanding that Euro-solidarity is broken because of Brexit. Now, (inaudible), and this is, of course, where we are as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  In the case -- in cases like this, where you have comprehensive and quite damaging cyber attacks, in your view, does Article V apply?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I'm quite sure that also if you read the academic analysis of what cyber might cause and that it can have as devastating consequences to a nation's security as conventional attacks, then I'm quite sure that we can imagine situations where Article V would apply. But until you have tested, you'll never know.  </p><p>      On the other hand, you don't want to bring the threshold of calling Article V low, so it will always be a difficult question on how to move forward.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  But that is the Russian strategy, is it not, to pursue activities and attacks that are just below the perceived threshold of a coordinated response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes, but when it becomes dangerous to a country's security and sovereignty, then you know that you have to go and say, \"This is an Article V situation.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Now, did you consider that in 2007? Because this was quite -- I mean, this was an attack designed to cut Estonia off, right, in effect?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First of all, 2007 attack was in no way dangerous to Estonia's security, because what Estonia was able to do in 2007, it walled off the country. Inside the country, services was running, so Estonia was not down. What was down was the external connection to Estonia.  </p><p>      I was in Luxembourg. I couldn't access my bank account, but all Estonians in Estonia could and the services were up and running. So it definitely was not an attack which could -- which could have actually been a risk to this country's security.  </p><p>      In addition, it wasn't -- it wasn't very effective in -- in attacking the vital systems of the country. Digital government systems, yes. But I mean, nobody dies if they are down for two hours. They were mostly functional and they were just walled off from the rest of the internet world.  </p><p>      The simple denial of the service attack, which nowadays is very common. So definitely, that would not have been an Article V case.  </p><p>      But if you think of the whole 2007 situation, with Russia provoking also -- also while people were fighting on the streets for a couple of nights, et cetera, so you had -- you had a more dire situation than just a cyber attack and you had to see all of these facts together. That was a cyber attack combined with what else was going on in the country, and that is why the European partners and allies also came out in strong support of Estonia, calling out that this is Russian.  </p><p>      And this is very important that this call came; that nobody then asked (inaudible) questions, et cetera, probably because they couldn't yet. I mean, this was not the common thinking then. Everybody was in shock and awe that cyber attack against a nation can exist at all.  </p><p>      But nevertheless, the support was -- was -- as we see it today when something like this happens.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There was a good piece last week, I believe it was by Max Boot, who made the argument that the U.S. and NATO is, in effect, fighting the last war again; making that mistake of fighting the last war. That in this environment of hybrid warfare like you experienced in 2007 and see elsewhere today, that it's not about buying more littoral combat ships, right? That you need to focus on the right tools, whether they be offensive cyber weapons, et cetera.  </p><p>      Do you have a concern that that's the case; that folks are looking backwards as opposed to forwards? Especially with Estonia that -- that by its very nature looks forward in terms of technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes. But first of all, just because you have newer kinds of risks doesn't make the old kind of risks disappear, unfortunately.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  If it were that, I would be extremely happy and maybe even welcome these new risks which are geographic (ph) in nature, because then, of course, our geopolitical seismic (ph) region will not be anymore geopolitically seismic (ph) because globally we are.  </p><p>      And it's only partly a joke, but if you think seriously where Russia is ahead of us -- we know that NATO is stronger than Russia. But if you look at, let's say, eastern border of NATO and conventional capacities, then Russia has considerable might there.  </p><p>      If you now think that you are -- you are seeing what is happening to our country's economy and technological development, because while Russia is very proud about Ukrainian sanctions and its own counter-sanctions by which Russia doesn't buy agriculture products anymore from European market, that it is now an independent -- well, independently able to feed its own population, then this is wonderful. You are primary sector exports (ph) and you are great agrarian country, 21st century.  </p><p>      Something's missing. Technology's missing.  </p><p>      Russia is losing out on technology development because of our sanctions big time. I'm quite sure that if Georgia never happened, Russia would be part of the Horizon 2020 European R&amp;D program, because Georgia, for example, is participating in that program.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  So they must see that they're losing in their might. I mean, it's not so big country, it's not economically well off, and its prognosis is bad, so -- and you still have some conventional advantages somewhere, globally.  </p><p>      I think this is particularly the time when you need to be vigilant in your analysis and in your response to be able to deter, if there were to be a sudden attempt to try to turn the tables.   </p><p>      Therefore, we cannot neglect conventional risks, even if there are new risks. And I think it's more true today than, maybe, it was, I'd say, 10 years ago.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  You raise a point, which is something of a contrarian point of view here in the U.S., that -- that the perception that Russia is winning is misplaced; that, in fact, they're paying a very high cost in economic terms, technological terms.  </p><p>      You know, if you -- if you -- you know, to echo, to some degree, as you did, Senator John McCain, Russia's a gas station, right? You know, the -- the -- you know, it's still basically a petrol economy. Not great to -- to travel...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  What's that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well, nowadays, which is fine.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      You have to give a country credit it deserves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Big picture, do you -- are you making an argument that Russia's losing strategically?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes. Strategically, Russia is losing. And, therefore, I think we need to take this very seriously -- what their analysis of the situation might be.   </p><p>      What -- when will the window of opportunity of turning the tables suddenly on us close? We don't know this. We don't know what's the analysis, and we don't know, also, on a technical level, when is the moment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Turning the tables meaning a catastrophic attack meant to...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Something going really wrong, yes. In conventional sphere, in somewhere else -- something like Salisbury -- I mean, we didn't -- if somebody had told you two months ago that this would happen, would you have thought it's probable? No. So I think we need to be very vigilant right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Do you -- do you envision that -- again, I'm asking you to predict, which I know that no politician likes to do. But -- but are you speaking in the cyber sphere? Are you speaking in the kinetic sphere, or -- could be a whole range?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I'm speaking in cyber sphere. And I think, Russia aside, we need to think much more seriously how we treat, internationally, the risks stemming from -- from the cyber, and also from the fact that we have more and more self-learning systems.  </p><p>      And, also, I think we should think about -- that maybe Elon Musk and (inaudible) and others -- that they're right about A.I. And they put the probability of having A.I. at 50 percent at 2050. Well, I take this with -- pinch of salt, because I have a degree in genetic engineering.  </p><p>      And, when I was starting in university in '90s, then, everybody was sure that we would clone people by 2010. And we are very, very far from that. So I don't know whether we should take it seriously. But at least I know this:  that we can create systems which are self-learning and pretty autonomous, looking like A.I. to most people.   </p><p>      So we should actually understand what new kinds of risks stem from that. And I particularly love the -- the example of an -- of an -- close-to-A.I. or even A.I. war -- means (ph) somebody's nuclear system -- doesn't matter whose -- it -- this could be the system of an axis of good or an axis of bad. Doesn't matter, really.   </p><p>      But imagine you have a war, and it's in somebody's system, and it's self-learning, and we sent it into the system thinking that we know what it will find as equipment (ph) -- the software in that system -- and then it finds something unexpected. For example, somebody has taken a contaminated computer to the system -- very common thing. Somebody read (ph) internet on the same computer, then connected it to some technical system.  </p><p>      And this, our A.I. little war now (ph), reads this information. And this changes our understanding, because we thought it will only read and learn about the system, but he (ph) read a piece of news. And this piece of news said that United Nations getting ready to ban A.I. for military use.  </p><p>      And this system is in the nuclear element, and it knows it is A.I., and it knows the system where it is is military. What will happen? And it's not as science fiction as -- as it sounds. Maybe this particular example still is, but I use it to explain that, I mean, we have loads of things which might come not necessarily from state and government actors.   </p><p>      Artificial intelligence, as far as we see now, will not be created by a public actor. It will created, probably, by somebody else. Where? We don't know. When? We don't know. We know it hasn't been created, because, according to the current technology development, it would eat so much energy that we would notice that somewhere, globally, energy is being used to this extent.  </p><p>      But it might happen. And we are not even discussing about how international law should apply, what should be our measures, counter-measures.   </p><p>      For example, we could agree, at the United Nations level, that, if we detect that energy somehow being used in a concentrated way somewhere, or that somebody has built a neural-network-like computer network somewhere, this would trigger an inspection.   </p><p>      Are we discussing it? No. We are only discussing the cyber, conventional, and failing even there to agree how exactly international law should apply in cyber sphere.  </p><p>      I think we are so far behind the curve of where we should be. And I think this is now urgent discussion which you should be having. But you don't have many takers, I have to say.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There's a great quote, and I don't -- I can't quote it from memory, that -- that Putin said at a conference last year about -- the country that controls A.I. will dominate in a number of ways. And then I often read that quote at speeches, and ask folks who they think said it. And they always say, \"Elon Musk,\" or something like that.  </p><p>      It's Putin. He's clearly thinking in these terms. Whose -- who, to our knowledge, is ahead on A.I.? China? Russia? The U.S.? Estonia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  My guess is that it's in private sector, not in government sector right now. But, indeed, what -- I noticed this quote, and I was very worried.   </p><p>      Because, normally, President Putin speaks -- he -- in his -- if we look back in retrospective -- I mean, all the discussion about geopolitical catastrophe of breaking down the Soviet Union, thereafter came tries to negotiate, then -- Georgia, et cetera -- sometimes you hear something -- well, we've heard very often, for example, that the Baltic states are very stupid to leave the Russian electricity grid, because, of course, it's very technically stable.  </p><p>      And the -- which is true, by the way. It is technically very stable. Yet, we know that he spent a lot of money to make sure that his structures will not suffer if we are pushed off the grid suddenly. Right now, this is not still possible, but it is (ph).  </p><p>      So this makes us to -- work with European Commission to make sure that we could be deconnected (ph) from -- from that grid as quickly as possible and connected to the European electricity grid even if, I mean, economically, it doesn't -- well -- make much sense to do this. But it's clear that, if you hear these things, you need to think about what that might mean.   </p><p>      Similarly, there was a call for respect, and then Salisbury. So, indeed, we need to pay attention that artificial intelligence, if it happens in -- somewhere, then we need to detect it quickly. We need to detect it quickly, especially in case it will be in the -- on the axis of bad, not on the axis of good. But my guess is it will be private sector.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  So now I'm going to ask you to predict again. You said that folks, you know, years ago, predicted we'd already be cloning dogs and cats and human beings, and we're not there yet. How many years or decades off do you think the breakthrough is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I cannot -- I'm not a specialist in that field. But, looking at -- again, at this benchmark of genetic engineering, then we cannot -- well, we can make bacteria with some characteristics which we wanted it to have; that's all. And we are eight years past the date we were supposed to clone human beings, so it might take time.  </p><p>      But this doesn't change the fact that -- I mean, autonomous systems, self-learning autonomous systems can mimic pretty closely something which is A.I. It will not be a -- a science fiction, but it -- it may be nevertheless as dangerous, or almost as dangerous. It's just that it's easier to predict what it thinks -- well, \"thinks\" in quotation marks of course.  </p><p>      But this example what I came about the war (ph) in nuclear system, this doesn't need to be A.I. It could be actually a -- a well-learning automated system just happening on the wrong piece of information.  </p><p>      My example was understandable for us, but we are talking machines there. There might be other technical data which is not understandable for us right now here, which will actually push it off the course, and we need to be ready for these kind of developments.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  And -- and self-learning systems like that exist today?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes, we have self-learning systems playing really good board games, we know that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  For a digitized economy like Estonia, which has created, of course, many jobs and opportunities for its population, but of course technology, as we know, often replaces human jobs with -- with machines, et cetera.  </p><p>      Is -- is the approach of A.I. and -- and the existence of self learning something, you know, a rough equivalence today. What did that do to the future of work?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I think will do good to the future of work. First of all, already now we can see that the current mediocre level of technology was what the humankind is able to achieve is changing the work -- work already.  </p><p>      I mean, the fact that I can work from Tallinn for somebody in America, or in France or in Australia demonstrated people don't need enterprises anymore to get the best added value of their skills. They don't need broad skills; they can be extremely narrow skills, and -- and they could sell them globally because you can sell them online, which poses a huge question -- who will get the taxes? And without taxes, we will not -- we will not be able to help our people to pass this transfer.  </p><p>      Sometimes people think that the nature of the job will change only for well learned and educated people, but I think it is a great equalizing fact (ph), because you can -- you can actually be somebody who would (inaudible) something very classic, like handicraft, but you will be able to sell it globally.  </p><p>      We have in Estonia this -- this case where is (ph) a South African man living in a small county in middle of nowhere basically in Estonia, and he makes bows and arrows. They're really good, I've -- I've understood, because they sell globally for a high price. And -- but he just prefers to live where, I mean, his clients -- the closest client I think was more than 2,000 kilometers away.  </p><p>      So, an example, and even for handicapped people, let's imagine you have an -- well an autistic person who is ready to knit socks, but only red ones, probably in his vicinity he wouldn't find enough takers, and since he's incapable to socialize, he cannot sell. But online and globally probably he finds enough, I mean, these people who love just these red socks. So you can sell and -- and you can have a job. And previously, such a person would have been unemployed.  </p><p>      So there are numerous ways of how they -- well the work is changing. And what I hate most is that let's tax robots and pay subsistence fees to people. And it always takes me back to the change from agricultural economies to industrial. What if we had taxed tractors and paid subsistence fees to agricultural workers who lost their jobs? Would they have taken up industrial jobs? They wouldn't. And I admit that this transfer was extremely painful, but it was painful because we didn't have social systems and dedication.  </p><p>      So now our difficult equation is actually how to keep our social systems and dedication going when the traditional tax system is obviously going with traditional work system. We gathering every morning into an enterprise and working for (ph) the same enterprise, having home address and demanding services in one country globally. This is all going, and we've got to start talking about it right now.  </p><p>      And my understanding is that in future, our country will be hub for people, a (inaudible) kind of. I've (inaudible) Estonia, but it provides me (ph) social and educational services, my children online tutoring in Estonia language wherever they are globally, but it doesn't necessitate me to have a postal address in Estonia or something. It's a deal between me and this country.  </p><p>      And the problem of course is that if we are lazy in this thinking, then either we lose these services or they will all get privatized, which will actually lower their inclusivity, which might not be a problem for you here in America, but definitely for us in Europe, because our people expect us to provide a kind of school system, health system, health care system, which is available to almost (ph) everybody. So we are much more afraid of -- of these kind of developments, that (inaudible) tax base. But if we are rigid and say to people that unless you do it the old-fashioned way, we don't provide you with services, then they will opt out and go private, or simply go without, and then try to opt in, because only pension system penalizes late opt in. Health-care system does not penalize late opt in in any way; educational system for our children either.  </p><p>      I mean, we need to figure it out, because otherwise we will lose the best proportion of earnings tax wise from the younger population.  </p><p>      And if you look globally, U.K., Netherlands, Estonia, the number of independently working people is already radically grown, so I'm not talking about tomorrow; I'm talking today. And we need to really think about globally and internationally what to do about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  This is happening as we have -- we have a crisis of confidence in a whole host of institutions here in the U.S. I'm a member of the fake news media. You heard the president standing next to you make a reference to fake news yesterday.  </p><p>      But it's affecting our technology companies as well. I mean, Facebook's position in the -- in the wake of Russian interference in the election. How much of a challenge is that? Do you see any similar loss of confidence or fear of big tech in Estonia, and if not, how -- how have you avoided that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  We feared Facebook as everybody else, of course. It's pretty obvious, but the difference is we have alternatives to Facebook. We have secure internet communication channels as well.  </p><p>      And I've ran around the globe for a year and a half telling everybody that this is unfair that governments have left people and businesses in internet without governmental support, because in the real world or (inaudible) world, you don't imagine that you cannot identify the other person with whom you are talking or interacting or contracting, at least at that point -- at least you would ask for a passport. You don't board a plane without knowing that everybody has dutifully shown up their passports. So we know with whom we are flying all the time.  </p><p>      For some reason, governments have failed to notice that their people and their businesses are in internet, and it's a big part of every transaction and quite a lot of communication change is online.  </p><p>      And I think governments have exactly the same obligation in the digital sphere to provide people with identification. Estonians have had this way of establishing safe corridors in internet to communicate, because using your digital identity also will create an encrypted channel. So it is failsafe, and, second, you know with whom you're talking. And this kind of internet connection is not dangerous, so our people are not afraid of using -- of using digital signatures, but of course, they also worried about somebody taking their data on Facebook.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  And also we can differentiate. We know this. It's -- it's weird, but, well, I know people have fun with -- with these kind of things. For example, one of my friends heard this. Somebody told that, in Estonia, there exists a -- well, an ear (ph) doctor, and his name is -- is Dr. Ear (ph). So he -- she wanted to check whether this is really true, and she Googled, and, for two months, she afterwards got all kinds of ear remedies, hearing devices, these kind of advertisements.  </p><p>      So people automatically assume that this is OK for kind of consumer services. But, for some reason, they didn't realize that, if this is going on, then, of course, this is going on also for political debate.   </p><p>      And our people, since they can differentiate between safe and unsafe internet a little bit better -- because we have safe one, as well, and we are not forced to use the unsafe one if we don't want to -- then I think they are a bit more resilient than people elsewhere.   </p><p>      Yet they are afraid, of course, and they simply don't use Facebook, in that case, of course, if they are afraid. Nobody would, anyway, contract over (ph) Facebook. I don't know. That would be weird, so.  </p><p>      Also, I've noticed that, in Estonia, people pay for internet time. If they have transacted and signed a contract, then you don't use a credit card for payment, but you use safe channel. You go to a bank, log in online and make an online payment. It doesn't take much longer, but is much safer. People prefer this and consider this safer than using credit cards online.  </p><p>      But they do it because it's as comfortable. If it were more comfortable, or not possible, comfortably, to pay -- you'd need to walk to bank office, for example -- then, they would use credit cards. So it has to be.   </p><p>      The -- the good internet has to be comfortable and available, and it starts from identification. I cannot repeat this often enough. It's our obligation as -- as governments to realize people have to have safe identification means in the internet sphere, as they have in real life.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  You have the advantage of having a genetic engineering degree, so -- very aware of -- of the health implications of a highly digitized society, particularly as it relates to privacy.   </p><p>      In light of what you were just discussing, social media, et cetera, how do you -- how do you handle those? Because, of course, no one is more concerned about their privacy than when it comes to -- to health information.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I think all Estonian politicians always ask this question from all audiences:  Do you know who read your doctor's notes last? Was it your doctor, or somebody you don't know? When we in Estonia -- if somebody reads our -- I don't know, tax declaration, health information -- you know.  </p><p>      But, I mean, sometimes people think that Estonia is -- is a kind of wild world of -- world of internet. It isn't. It's actually a much stronger regulated world of internet. Our government has given people numerous guarantees that they will know if somebody's -- looks around in their data.   </p><p>      We also gather genetic information of all our people. It's another legally permissive environment -- result of Estonian way of having a state. We -- we know much more of our -- our people's, well, genetic data -- common markers for common ailments (ph).   </p><p>      And we are enlarging this project, and -- and people are not afraid to participate, because state has given guarantees about how this data is to be handled. Even your doctor wouldn't see it if you don't want it. But then, probably, you don't want, first, to have this, and this is, of course, voluntary, whether you do or you don't.  </p><p>      So we have Estonian Genome Foundation, created at the same time as, more or less -- as the digital Estonia, and it's very similar in -- in what we did in digital. We probably have done other things, but they have not flied (ph). This flied (ph).   </p><p>      It flied (ph) for short term, from 2000 to 2003, because, you know, we created this environment where population and genetics was legal, and it wasn't in most countries, globally. It was in Iceland. Iceland was our only competitor, but, luckily, they have even tinier population. So, to do population genetics in a population of 300,000 is -- is more of a joke than doing it in 1.3 million, which is still a joke, but something.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      So private companies flocked in and paid for founding Estonia Genome Foundation. It was done on investment banking finance only. But then what happened? The governments came in. The other governments, entering (ph) the market, because they, of course, started to buy all these services, because, of course, companies were clever enough to say that you have to pay. It's not enough to create legal space.  </p><p>      And then, for 10 years, it was dormant until the technology became so cheap that, now, we can continue with -- with helping our people to understand the genetic risks of having heart attack, or diabetes II and other of these common ailments.  </p><p>      But, again, very often, people ask, then, that \"Are you afraid of\" -- and we say no, because we know that this data is protected. The state knows how to protect data. And -- and it's in -- it's still in my ownership.   </p><p>      I mean, yes, it is in some kind of a database, but I own it. It's not state's. It's mine, and I decide who uses it, and how. Personally, I don't mind if you know that my diabetes II risk is higher, and it is. But that's fine with me, so I can tell it openly.  </p><p>      And I think it's important we work on these areas, as well, because 90 percent of the world's population, when they feel sick, what do they do first? Google. Nowadays, what you have on Google is mostly rubbish medical information.   </p><p>      But you need to have solid alternatives for people. So medical doctors need to have access to people's data -- of course, without names and everything, so -- to analyze and create self-learning medical doctors who are able to respond to people.  </p><p>      NHS in Great Britain is experimenting, actually, that, if people call in the emergency line, and it's established that, in fact, it's not an emergency, then they are trying, with -- with a robot, to try to, well, direct this person to go to pharmacy or to go to doctor or whichever way.   </p><p>      But these systems have to have databases to learn. And donating your information to them -- health information or genetic information -- in an anonymous format is a great thing to do for humanity. But it needs to be safe, and it can be safe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  But -- but how could you -- I guess the issue is, even with regulation, the question becomes confidence, right, and confidence in security, because I'm someone -- and listen, I -- I have such a baseline level of -- of digital knowledge, but -- but I have an assumption -- and this is partly because of the work that I do, but I -- also, I lived in China -- I have assumption that there is no actual privacy, because I've been a victim of -- of three or four -- of the three or four biggest hacks:  the OPM hack, the Anthem Healthcare one, and I forget what the other one -- I've lost track.   </p><p>      I have so many free digital ID services paid for by various entities that mishandled my information, I -- I don't even know. So how do you get those two to come together? Because you could have that knowledge, but, without confidence, then, you know...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First thing first. This is the big problem of developing digital country like Estonia:  Lots of digital services provided online, indeed, with identification ways -- I don't know. You use some username and some code, and then you write it on your computer, have a special file in your computer, et cetera. It's unsafe, terribly unsafe.  </p><p>      Or take a very -- it's a concrete example. I got it from Rudy Giuliani -- or I put the example together, but I learned from him. E-prescription's pretty popular in United States, but it's an e-mail. I'm sorry.   </p><p>      And, when something goes wrong with this e-mail, e-prescription, then confidence in all e-prescriptions is down the drain, including ours. But our e-prescription system is much safer. You -- you can never say it's absolutely safe, but it's definitely safer than paper analogs (ph), so I'm quite sure I call it safe.   </p><p>      But, when something goes wrong in one service, people lose trust in others. And that is where we need to go up (ph) the confidence and trust of all our people, constantly explaining to our people where we differ.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  We are not, I mean, holding this to (ph) ourselves. Actually, we very much like to expand our -- our X-Road, what we call, which is our identification system.  </p><p>Finland is using the same, and we can change real -- real-time data with them. We don't, because we haven't sold it legally, but, technically, we already can, if -- for example.  </p><p>      So we are open to others to use ours or similar systems. We are not telling that you cannot do it. But, if you come with us into this world, you have to take responsibility to -- explaining to your people how these services work.   </p><p>      And, in addition, you have to promise that you make some promises to your people about how -- and then you have to apply this in your law base (ph) -- how you use this data, how you protect this data, what is your obligation vis-a-vis your people in case you have this data.  </p><p>      For example, I would absolutely refuse to distribute our X-Road's technology to a company for -- which I knew that it has, let's say, only one single database where it tends to gather all the information about its citizens, et cetera.  </p><p>      But, I mean, if you do it in a smart -- smart and sharp way, and protect this, also, legally, what you are doing, and protect your people, it can be done, not only in Estonia, but all that's following (ph). Denmark is quite good example, Luxembourg is quite good example. We are small, but it's something.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Before -- I do want to go to the audience soon -- I do want to ask you about blockchain, because I know this is at the top of your list of interests.  </p><p>      Is the -- and, just out of curiosity, and you know far more than me -- but the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble, or at least the volatility there -- is that a just a bump on the road towards all the potential of blockchain technology?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Well, do we want to talk blockchain or Bitcoin? Let's agree on that first?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  It's an example.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Totally bad example. Let's take, then, Bitcoin.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And, for Bitcoin, you don't need to be a -- a well -- well-established macroeconomists to understand that money needs economy, and a link to a real economy. Then you know whether you have too much money, too little money, is it overvalued, undervalued -- all this.   </p><p>      I ask you, where's the underlying economy of Bitcoin? There isn't. Or, if there is, then we cannot measure it; therefore, we cannot understand what's the value of Bitcoin. This much about Bitcoin -- I mean, this is an illusion.   </p><p>      This has an interesting afterthought, if I think more about the Bitcoin situation. A well-known A.I. example says that A.I. is dangerous because it will make the world into paper clips. And then people say, \"No, no. A.I. will not be so stupid as to make the world into paper clips.\"  </p><p>      And I've also thought that maybe it wouldn't. But, now, I mean, we are not A.I. We are human beings, and we mine Bitcoin. We spend real-life resources to the detriment of our environment -- lots of energy, et cetera, and other resources -- to mine something which has absolutely no value. So, I mean, where exactly are we better than A.I., here, in this problem?  </p><p>      Now, to blockchain, this is different thing. Blockchain is a technology which allows different systems to keep track about what different systems around it, with which it is connected, are doing. And we think this is very useful technology.   </p><p>      It's -- it's one step forward from what we have, because our digital signature, for a normal person, would look pretty much like blockchain, because it's signature and it's timestamped. It's similar enough for experts to look for the authors (ph) of Bitcoin in Estonia, but it's not the same technology.  </p><p>      So blockchain allows -- for our case, we think it will allow our state to go proactive in offering services. How? Right now, we still have to apply for state digital services, one by one. For example, you have a child. You register the birth, then you apply for social services.  </p><p>      But our people are starting to ask this question that -- I mean (ph), \"Government, you promised you would only ask once. Now, you have the information that I have a baby, and we are entitled to a certain payment for this baby.\"  </p><p>      It's not relevant how much you earn, we have universal child support in Estonia. \"So why on earth, government, you now force me to apply, even if I can do it online? Why I need to go to some home page and, I mean, ask for this service? You can simply provide it to me. I have a baby. You know my bank account, because it's -- I pay taxes. And you know I'm entitled to this money. So why should I ask?\"  </p><p>      And the answer is, because we don't have blockchain. Our systems do not have the capacity to make sure that -- I mean, one system -- what one system is doing -- that something's not going wrong at the same time at -- in the different system. Blockchain will help us to solve this problem.  </p><p>      Our pilot is not social -- social security, because this is a high-confidence-level-demanding service. Our pilot there is traffic accident -- simple traffic accident, which happens every day. I mean, two cars get a little bit ruined. It's an insurance case. And we think that we -- by using blockchain, we can solve it in 30 minutes -- all the administrative questions.  </p><p>      So you register your traffic accident. We have, of course, online car registry, and all these elements are there -- online insurance, full database of insurance schemes, et cetera. So we could, actually, in 30 minutes, we think, send information to both parts (ph) of the accident, and -- about how this incident was solved.   </p><p>      But, for this, we need to have blockchain, which makes us also to think that -- when is the point when we need to create a legal entity for an -- learning -- or a machine learning system, or a machine system? And we feel we are coming quite close to this point. So we are now discussing exactly with -- how to regulate -- how to regulate, well, autonomous systems in our law base.  </p><p>      Attribution questions will rise. And then, of course, it will be an interesting question. I think I read it this morning in one Estonian daily (ph) -- it -- lawyers were discussing that, if a robot kills somebody, then how do we know that the robot did not get the order from its owner to kill somebody, but simply went crazy?   </p><p>      And, I mean, it's -- it's not -- I mean, it's not a laughing matter. This is the questions we need to solve. And also, for our -- this proactive state, we need to solve this question, and, yet again, we need to solve the question of privacy.   </p><p>      People probably need to somehow opt in to this kind of system, understanding and analyzing, themselves, whether they want to use or they don't want to use this.   </p><p>      So it's not easy, but we are thinking forward and we are forced to think forward, because, exactly, people are asking, \"You know this. Why do I need to apply at all?\" It's people who want this.   </p><p>      And government, once it has undertaken this digital disruption of society, cannot back off. You have to continuously, all the time, first of all, make sure that the existing systems are still safe to use, that you can patch them up if something goes wrong and that you can continue developing.  </p><p>      And it is also true that, sometimes, things go wrong. We have at least two means of identification online. Yesterday, for two hours, one of them was down. The other was working. So we need to have alternatives. But the problem with our country is that you cannot have digital with paper alternative. You have to have digital with digital alternative.  </p><p>      And -- and we had this problem last year, where there is a chip maker, whom I wouldn't name, but maybe some of you know, which actually called 1 billion chips off the market, said that they aren't safe to use.   </p><p>      Most of these were door cards (ph). High number was actually ID cards, but mostly in the countries which -- where people have IDs, but don't use them. So they could be simply, well, shut down for a while.  </p><p>      We couldn't do it. For us, it was right that (ph) the service continues, because our people refused it otherwise. They wouldn't go to offices to queue for services.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  They even got really angry that -- because some of them finally -- most of them could solve the problem online, but some couldn't. And they had to go to a police or border guard office. And then, we got loads of complaints that -- oh, kidding (ph), I had to queue for an hour. And I mean, and then you explain to people that people in Western Europe normally take a day off to register their car.  </p><p>      So this is where you have your population, and this also demonstrates to you that whatever Estonian government wants you to do -- go completely back to paper-based system for example -- it simply cannot. Disruption has happened, and now you have to live with the consequences and work forward to make sure that you are actually -- well, continuing to provide services to your people, to their satisfaction.  </p><p>      Which means that even we are on the Mars already, our people want us to be even further. I mean so, Earth for them is not the solution.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  So wait, should we buy up block chain, or -- I wasn't clear. I'm joking.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I got the answer loud and clear. OK, so we're going to go to the -- to the assembled audience here for questions. I think we have about a half hour. Gentleman in the back with his hand raised? And there are -- yes, there are microphones.  </p><p>      Please if you can, identify yourself. And the other guidance I always give is phrase it in a question rather than a statement or a speech.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Michael Shraig (ph) with MIT.  </p><p>Estonia is a very small country, as you pointed out. China, huge country. United States, huge country. Key to making machine learning work is scale. You're a small -- you're a scientist, you're from a small country, but you deal with giants and behemoths.  </p><p>      What's the most important thing you've learned about managing scale in an environment where petabytes and zettabytes is the future of what you're talking about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First thing to realize is indeed that scale wise, we don't create technology. We use technology quite common in private sector globally, so we don't have to carry the cost, and we fully understand that we don't control the delivery chain of this technology.  </p><p>      And this is why we need to make sure we're using, let's say, these digital chips, that we also have mobile I.D., for example, because we simply don't control the technology. But this is what makes it available.  </p><p>      If you now look more locally in Estonia, then since we've had absolute inclusivity, this digital chip is part of our I.D. card, with which we travel as well, at least within the European Union. Then this inclusivity from the other side is (inaudible). So for local services actually, companies have it quite good. They have the 1.3 million market at least, immediately at their hand.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Gentleman here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I thank you for your comments today. Two questions, one -- are (ph) there related. One is recently Estonia joined a number of other countries, including the U.S., in condemning the NotPetya worm and attributing it to Russia.  </p><p>      This is always a delicate question when you have this kind of collective response. What -- attribution the other day is a -- is a, you know, political issue. What level of confidence do you need, does Estonia need, to join that kind of collective because it's more powerful?  </p><p>      And then on Russia, what kinds of actions would you think would be effective in actually deterring their behavior in cyberspace? You said that we need to do more. McMaster said that last night. What kinds of things would actually work?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  In cyberspace, we need monitoring, and we need to agree that international monitoring is allowed, and that there will be elements and events which will trigger international monitoring, very similarly as you have with (ph) sensitive nuclear technology globally. We need to agree what it is.  </p><p>      I give you a few examples. Radical shift in energy consumption in some laboratory or somewhere is one thing. Second is now we understood that we need to create the, like, neural networks to be able to think of A.I. which will not consume so much energy that it will be dead immediately. These could be regulated. This is hardware after all. This could be regulated that you need to allow international monitoring, and this -- well, we need to bring in globally all countries. Because as I said, it's not anymore enough like in the nuclear case, that some countries agree and the rest will simply, well, accept because they don't have the weapons. It's global, and we don't know where it will -- where it will happen. So this much for regulation.  </p><p>      For confidence level, it's not quantitative; it's always qualitative analysis, and depends -- well it very much, you have to go case by case.  </p><p>      But it's interesting that we're joining (ph), because for us it's a solidarity act, because NotPetya didn't pass in Estonia, only in one international company system, which was not linked to Estonian system. Pure (ph) act of solidarity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Is there a mic?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Yeah, it's coming.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Fran Burwell from the Atlantic Council.  </p><p>      Two questions. First off, when you are thinking about how to deter or respond to an attack, does it matter if it is a nation-state behind it, or whether it is organized crime, or is it the same response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Same.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  And -- OK. And the other thing is, you raised the issue of taxes. But your approach to tax sounds a little bit different for me from what has been proposed by some E.U. governments, including in terms of taxing digital enterprises, which, as you're well aware, some people here fear is aimed primarily at some large U.S. companies in Europe. Can you be a little bit more specific about where you think taxes should go to counter this -- to deal with this new world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I can be a little bit more specific. Fully aware that first of all, I am in -- I'm in contradiction with much of the European thinking, plus OSCE (ph) rules, everything. So we absolutely need to modify international space, and we cannot go alone. So we need to first understand that, I mean, we have this problem, and then we need to start seeking solutions. And voluntary declaration of (inaudible) with any chosen state would be actually something, which probably is the -- is the solution to the problem. And I realize I'm -- that we are very far from -- from getting there.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, Europe is doing what they always do in these kinds of systems. You apply a patch, and then you see what you can do to solve -- solve the problem as it is. And I think applying patches meanwhile to make sure that society is at least accepting that, I mean, we do need to tax differently, just because internet exists, is -- is a step in right direction. Of course it can be inhibitive to -- to some investment and so on. And I'm not necessarily supporting it, but I see where it comes from politically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Gentleman standing in the back?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I'm Basil Scarliss (ph). I've been involved in foreign affairs.  </p><p>      And I have a question on sanctions. Perhaps a good way to deter Russian cyber attacks and other meddling and military action would be to have a more effective regime for punishing the Russian leader and the oligarchs.  </p><p>      And one obstacle is that in the United States, and to some extent in the United Kingdom, we allow shell companies to purchase properties, to make investments in corporations and in other organizations without revealing the beneficial owner; they can hide behind an attorney.  </p><p>      The question I have, is do you think it would be much more effective to have targeted sanctions, especially if we could get Congress to pass appropriate legislation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Simple answer would be yes.  </p><p>      Then the political answer would be doesn't concern me, because Estonia doesn't have that much oligarchic money in the country. It's a tiny economy, completely transparent as well, because digital makes it also transparent.  </p><p>      And -- and the practical answer is that I think yes, but we must make sure that we remain rule-of-law countries while we do it, as well. This is very important.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  If I could follow on that, this issue comes up -- it came with the response to Skripal attack -- that the next level would have been true financial penalties for people in power.  </p><p>      You'll often hear -- whether with Ukraine, U.S. election interference -- about going after Putin's money, whether freezing it or exposing it to -- to his people -- all of his various holdings around the world.  </p><p>      Why hasn't that happened yet, in your view?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I simply don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Good answer.   </p><p>      There's a group of folks here, but maybe I'll just go from the forward, back. There's a gentleman, and then behind two, and we'll go from there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hans Binnendijk from SAIS. First of all, let me say it's so refreshing to hear a president be able to converse the way you do on these issues.   </p><p>      I'd like to ask about Russian attacks using social media. This is below the denial-of-service level. What has been your experience -- not just in Estonia, but in a -- in the Baltic States in general -- with regard to Russian use of social media to try to affect the opinions of your minorities -- Russian-speaking minorities?  </p><p>      What have you been able to do about that? I presume you're countering it. And what lessons do you have for us in this area?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First, Baltic states -- well, I cannot say we have seen more of these kind of attacks. I think Germany has had a fair share, and visa case (ph) -- every German knows it. And -- and Emmanuel Macron called Putin out on disrupting the French election processes.   </p><p>      We have been expecting and preparing for -- when EFP (ph) was established -- that we will have quite some. Lithuania had one, but the reaction was so quick -- retaliation from Lithuania -- to inform people that this is false news, to make sure that everybody got it -- it was false news -- was so good.  </p><p>      But we've actually not seen any further elements. But we are, of course, ready all the time. And the only way to be ready is to tell your people this exists. We talk about troll factories. We show people that they do exist. And, frankly, try to read anonymous internet commentary under some article about -- I don't know, I do it under my articles about myself.  </p><p>      I recognize a troll writing quite soon. They are trying to put a message out about you, which comes whichever way -- I mean, it -- it comes. And you have a few -- few kind of names which always will appear. And then you learn to recognize it.  </p><p>      And -- and people, having live in -- lived a long time in the internet sphere, learn to understand this. Of course, we all have a big problem that most of the population is not able to differentiate between journalism -- something which pretends to be journalism and -- and something which think it is journalism, because they are -- well, I think those people who don't realize that they are not journalists, but they do -- don't do it in bad will.  </p><p>      And, previously, I expected journalists to check their facts when they provide them to me. For some reason, I cannot do it, and I think here is also a frank discussion to be had, because lots of fakes new -- fake news will die if people knew that the safe channels will never pick them up. Yet safe channels stay after they (ph) pick them up.  </p><p>      And we need to radically think how to avoid this. First of all, we all need to start paying for our online news, and then we can continue this discussion. I'm sorry it starts with that. Currently, the media sector has no resources to deal with it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There's a couple questions coming in from Twitters (ph). So, Madam President, this one is, \"We have an obligation to explain the issues around privacy and responsibility to citizens,\" relevant to what you were just discussing. \"How has Estonia brought citizenry to a level where they can understand the explanation?\"  </p><p>      And I'm -- I could identify with this, because, I'm sure, like you, you agree to terms that you don't know or read what those terms are, frequently. And so how do you manage that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  We have only one set of terms, and this is state-guaranteed digital identity. It's not too much to ask people to understand one set of terms and conditions.   </p><p>      And the terms and conditions are roughly the same. You keep your identity -- physical one -- separate from the passwords. And, if this, for some reason, was not the case, you run quickly or go online quickly somewhere where you can, well, just close your identity.  </p><p>      This is the basic drill. But we have to do it only one copy, because we have the universal system. And that is how we can build trust. And, of course, it is -- government is on the line.   </p><p>      It's government which is giving this currently. It's not Google or Amazon or -- or somebody anonymous or not in your country. And I'm sorry -- it wouldn't get better unless more governments take this responsibility.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  (Inaudible) gentleman in the beard, and then -- well, actually, you both have beards. So...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      ... we'll just have to go to -- left to right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hey. Matt Leonard with Government Computer News.   </p><p>      Can you talk briefly about the data embassy that you guys opened up last summer, what its current role is and any plans for opening up other data embassies, going forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  There's not much to talk about. It's a simple thing. Every private enterprise has a safe copy of everything it has, and, if the country's legal base allows it, has it outside of the country.  </p><p>      Now, we have a copy of Estonian state, every minute, every moment, in -- in a data embassy. And, since it is state and state data and we need to make sure that our law base about this data and what applies to this data will apply to where it is, we cannot simply establish a server somewhere.   </p><p>      We need to have an agreement with Luxembourg, also a very digitally minded and forward-looking country, that we will create a data embassy. So this server park (ph) is a sovereign territory of Estonia, and these servers and this data is -- belong to Estonian state. And, again, there is nothing technologically interesting.  </p><p>      Interesting thing is law space, which we two together created, between Luxembourg and Estonia. Whether we need to have more copies -- well, time will tell. But I am quite sure that people would -- would be quite happy to host Estonian data embassy.   </p><p>      On the other hand, other states need data embassies too. So -- they all have data which they need to store.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  And just -- I'm curious. Are those updated constantly, then? Because, if my -- my -- if I'm an insurance company, I don't know -- today's data is different from next week's data?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Yes. As I said, all Estonian digital signatures are timestamped. So, in this sense, they are like blockchain, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  And then did you (ph) -- if you still have a question -- the gentleman here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Grigory (ph) (inaudible) of Russian news agency. So, first question, how -- do you think Estonia needs more NATO (ph) troops to deter Russia? And, if so, how many troops do you need?  </p><p>      And the second one is about Skripal poisoning. So Estonia expelled a Russian diplomat, and -- but British experts said yesterday that they don't know a region of the agent that poisoned Skripal and his daughter.  </p><p>      So do you -- do you still believe your actions to expel Russian diplomat was justified? And do we (ph) have any evidence of Russian involvement in these poisoning? Or this is just a matter of solidarity with European countries?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  As most countries trace (ph) -- they didn't send out simply diplomats. They sent out diplomats who were acting in a way as diplomats shouldn't act. So there was another reason for -- for this concerted action.  </p><p>      What -- what concerns NATO troops, then -- NATO deterrence is -- well, has a history of being 100 percent efficient and effective. NATO has never failed to protect its territory. And it's -- in its entirety.  </p><p>      And we trust into this capacity to deter. And we're quite sure that all NATO steps are always adequate to make sure that this deterrence is -- is -- is valued.  </p><p>      In the summer, NATO summit will come together and discuss again those issues and these -- those elements. Our role there is to provide honest and open analysis of the security situation, considering conventional risks around our territory and among those -- well, is the information, which we have also talked publicly.  </p><p>      Today, the level of conventional capacity surrounding NATO's eastern flank is at the level of 2009 Zapad exercise. We need to draw conclusions from that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  In the far back here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p>      So, I've read that there are efforts to use blockchain technology in order to -- for example, in the Estonian stock exchange, to make voting easier and more secure and like it -- you know, immutable ledger and all that. You know, it's distributed.  </p><p>      There's also efforts in Australia to -- company called My Vote, I think, to utilize the -- you know, relatively secure and distributed immutable ledger to help voting. And I've also heard the idea for voter registries.  </p><p>      So I'm just curious, is Estonia considering using blockchain for voter database -- or yeah, voter registry databases, or e-voting -- like direct e-voting itself for candidates, or for referendums at the local level or at the larger level?  </p><p>      Because I've heard that. It's an interesting idea and Estonia seems to be a little bit on the cutting edge of using those technologies.  </p><p>      So yeah, just blockchain in voting systems basically is the question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Basically, we have e-voting and this system is tried and tested and free for everybody to try and hack. And voting is the highest confidence level digital service, so you change our voting technology only when you have tried and tested the new technology developments. And you have taught your people that this technology is safe.  </p><p>      On lower confidence level of services, voting should be the last which will shift technology, once you already have an established system of secure voting, which we have.  </p><p>      So I predict that all other Estonian public services will be blockchain based before our e-voting system will change.  </p><p>      And I always tell to other countries, some -- some countries would say, \"Let's start from e-voting.\" And I always say, \"That's a terribly bad idea. Start from school applications or something really -- well, low-worry services. Never start from e-voting.\"  </p><p>      You have to teach a population cyber hygiene first. You have to teach them to trust the system. And only then you should apply -- you should try to apply this technology to high-confidence level services like voting.  </p><p>      On the other hand, sometimes we get discussion that e-voting must be terribly unsafe. And it comes from people who vote by post, so beats me how this discussion can come up, but it does still come up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Well, it's a very common fear here, though. I think you would -- I can't imagine a -- and, of course, it's run by states here, but I can't imagine a state legislature who'd push hard for it today, because there is that lack of confidence.  </p><p>      Question from Twitter here:  \"Madam President, you speak about the need for government-mandated digital identity. Many people are concerned that this gives too much power to governments. Do you see a need for anonymous transactions? And if so, in what cases?\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Well, I'm -- in my character, I'm a simple housewifish politician, and -- and this philosophical question has been bothering me a long time now. Why people in free world trust their banks and Google and Amazon, but don't trust their government?  </p><p>      And I don't -- I don't know the answer, but I think we need to have some really good philosophers and social scientists analyzing this question.  </p><p>      It's not technology what they are mistrusting. They are not trusting, for some reason, their government. I don't know why.  </p><p>      It may be different in every society. There may be similarities. I come from a society where people trust government in this sense. They don't trust it for, I don't know, having -- having a good tax system, or actually our people are very, very critical about our -- our government. It's a national tradition to think we are a badly run country.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I'm not joking. I mean, in 1943, the chairman of the Bank of England, Lord Wedgwood, he said that Estonia was the best-run country in northern Europe. And then one of our politicians said that the other diplomats told him that, and it's astonishing how little your people appreciate it.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      It's still the same.  </p><p>      But they trust government when government provides digital services.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  There's a gentleman here along the aisle, and then we'll go to the back. I think we're getting down to probably the last question or two.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  All right, thank you. Johnathan Lynchman (ph) from the Providence Group.  </p><p>      You've mentioned a couple of times about educating the public, cyber hygiene. And I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what Estonia does with respect to public education on cyber-security and public information, in terms of making sure that it's both effective and that it reaches everyone.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  Well, teaching hygiene is not as effective as, I don't know, applying some social services. It never will be, because if you think about when we taught people simple hygiene, it was also a lengthy process which gradually reached our people's brains. That you have to wash hands, otherwise you will fall sick; or you have to use toilets, because it's not hygienic to just go to the wood.  </p><p>      And it took us time. But I think we have nowadays much better communication means to teach our people cyber hygiene.  </p><p>      And the truth is, we have to start from this and many people haven't done it. Technology will not solve it. There will never be a technology which will be able to cover for all human errors. The only way is to tell people that, \"You are responsible.\"  </p><p>      And the way to do it is education. I mean, you have to teach people at school about the risks of internet. We have (inaudible) police which goes around the schools and teaches children. And it also teaches them that it's just -- I mean, if it's not nice to be rude toward, well, the other kids in class in real life, it's as rude in internet, et cetera. It starts from this low-level thing.  </p><p>      On the other hand, I recognize that most countries are now in bigger difficulty than Estonia, because we started teaching cyber hygiene at the turn of the century. And then the risk was some virus, and you just downloaded Kaspersky or something else. And -- and then it was cleared. Now you have to jump into the internet of things.  </p><p>      Yet saying that it's impossible doesn't -- I mean, doesn't solve the problem, so we have to try. And I think it has to go down to (inaudible) and primary education, this cyber hygiene teaching.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Oh, right here in the front. And then we'll go to the back, if that's OK. Sorry, I'm having you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I can -- I -- I'm pretty loud. I'm Claudia Jona (ph) from the Atlantic Council.  </p><p>      What is your take on the -- on the -- (inaudible) deadlock (ph) on the global discussion on cyber norms? What is your take on -- on why the discussion -- where it's where it is right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I'm disappointed that the process in United Nations fell through. And I'm quite sure that we need to revive it.  </p><p>      Estonia, among other things, have decided to run for United Nations Security Council, and we are in the active phase of campaign. And whether we win or we lose, this is in our talking points about discussing global security.  </p><p>      New Zealand took climate to the Security Council. We will take digital to the Security Council. And when we are elected, and we hope we will be, this is (inaudible) platform, definitely, and we need to continue.  </p><p>      There was a working group. Marina Coleron (ph) from Estonia was -- was -- was responsible for that work as well, and -- and we were deeply disappointed when this got stalled. But the problem has not gone away.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  In the back, here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Madam President, Franica Jerka (ph), Broadcasting Board of Governors.   </p><p>      In this city, there is ongoing discussion how to counter Russian propaganda (inaudible). So my question is, do you believe the blocking of Russian TV channels, like it was made in Ukraine, like it will -- it will be in Moldova, in other countries, is an efficient measure? And the second question, do you think is it a good time for now, especially now, for Western countries -- United States, European Union -- to create, re-create, revive (inaudible) broadcasters like Voice of America or PRL (ph) in Baltic states or central European countries? Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I don't believe in restricting access to media outlets, even if I don't think they are free media outlets. I believe in telling my people that these are not free media outlets, so this is something which pretends to be media, or it's a government-run media. And we in Estonia, we do not restrict access to these media, yet we discuss this -- these channels and -- and everybody's free to choose whether, for example, to talk to them, and to -- how to react to them. But it needs to be known, and this is important.  </p><p>      But we need to not only think in the terms of Russia here. I think it would help everybody in this discussion to realize that the sources of fake news are numerous actually. I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty tough on Russia, but, I mean, sometimes I feel that people attribute all the problems in the global world to Russia.   </p><p>      Fake news can come from everywhere. There are various reasons for producing fake news, including somebody may simply want to sell their products, and -- and do away with somebody else's. I don't know. Somebody could say that Asics -- Asics running gear is -- is dangerous to your legs, and that doctors have analyzed and realized that because the first and -- and the back kind of padding are separate -- which is not the case for Nike running shoes -- it's dangerous.   </p><p>      So I mean, we have to analyze this in general, and need to teach our people how to check the facts. On the other hand, again, we need to get back a media space which we can trust somehow.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  I think this -- well, let's see. Maybe we have time for two more up there quick. There's a lady here, and then someone who I keep forgetting to go to in the way, way back.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you very much. Susan Ness, SAIS Center for Transatlantic Relations.  </p><p>      We talked extensively about the fake news issue. Also, within the European Union, there are efforts underway with respect to hate speech, to curtail that through government regulation. We'd like to know whether there is a major hate speech problem within Estonia, and if so, what role should government play in curtailing hate speech? Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  First of all, I don't sense that we have a big hate speech problem in Estonia. Second, I think that good habits is something which you shouldn't always try to write into the law text, because if we do away with good habits, and only go by law, then we are not the humankind. We like it, and we want it. So I don't believe in regulating everything.  </p><p>      I think most people can recognize when it is hate speech. When -- when it goes to the territory that considerable losses are occurred (ph) to the other party by -- by something which has been said, then we have our court system, which can provide and solve (ph), even in the current legal space, for these cases. But I don't think that, well, you should legislate something you cannot define, really.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  So this will have to be the final one. And I can only see your hand, so I can't say -- oh, there you are.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi. How do you -- I mean, in terms of the ever-evolving capabilities of A.I., how long until you think machines will supplant the human workforce? And what will the workforce do with their newfound time? And I guess that's the end of my question.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KALJULAID</emphasis>:  I am a politician; I'm not clairvoyant. But first of all, we see already that technology does not only take away jobs, but it creates it as well. I gave you a few examples, how I think that actually handicapped people, people with high -- high home-work burden, like women with small children, they actually are much freer to act in the new technology world actively on the job market.   </p><p>      So good things are happening, and they're happening also to people with limited education and skills. For example, channeling YouTube may make quite good money, and it doesn't take a degree at all.  </p><p>      So new jobs are coming. I don't know where, but the important thing is that we should actually support this change, not try to hold it back. I'm quite sure that in 15 years' time, in industry, all the things we need will be made with the same proportional workforce, which is currently in agriculture, 3 to 4 percent of all workforce, not more. The rest will work elsewhere, and they will do something online. What exactly, who knows?   </p><p>      Some things we can see already, but I'm sure there will be much more new stuff emerging, which we cannot imagine right now. At least, I cannot. I have a, well, not very good imagination.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCIUTTO</emphasis>:  Madam President, thank you very much. Just a phenomenal discussion.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1K-XN91-F15W-H18H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Thank you for joining us today. I'm David Lashway, and I lead Baker McKenzie's cyber-security global practice. Delighted to have you all with us today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      Good morning, Madam President. Thank you for joining us. Damon Wilson and the folks from the Atlantic Council, thank you for hosting today with us. Jim Schiutto from CNN is here, as well, and will be carrying the day in the discussions later this morning. So thank you all.</p><p>      Distinguished guests -- Mr. Chertoff, thank you for being here. It's good to see you and some old friends, Chris Boehner (ph) and others from the State Department. Thank you for joining us today.</p><p>      Yesterday, Madam President, while at the White House, you reminded us of the blue, black and white of your flag and that you will always remember that it flew in -- here in America when it could not fly in Estonia, during 50 years of the 100 years that we celebrate during your visit today, due to occupation.</p><p>      You reminded us, as well, of our partnership to confront challenges, and that that partnership is based upon three common things:  one, an understanding; two, the rule of law; and three, and perhaps most importantly, common beliefs. You said that we form the axis of the good based upon these.</p><p>      We are proud to fly the blue, black and white of your flag here today, and we welcome you to the discussion to advance our common beliefs and understanding around cyber-security and other security risks, both in Estonia, in Europe more generally and here in the United States. </p><p>      Marie Under, perhaps the most notable 20th-century Estonian poet, who lived during Soviet occupation and wrote of her experience, in her famous poem, \"Night,\" wrote, \"And, hand in hand, we walk uphill together.\" </p><p>      I hope that, through the discussion today, we will go hand in hand through this discussion and through what will confront us in cyber in the days ahead.</p><p>      And, finally, as we were just discussing this morning and as you mentioned yesterday, you reminded us Americans to reflect on the words that are carved in the granite monuments around our mall. That caused me to pause this morning and think for a moment of all the different statements that are carved across the mall that we look out on today. </p><p>      And, on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death, no statement came to mind more than this -- perhaps one of the great American poets in Mr. King:  \"If we are to have peace on Earth,\" he said, \"our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class and our nation, and this makes us better. And, in common, we must develop a world perspective.\"</p><p>      Thank you for sharing your perspective today. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to the discussion.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      PAVEL:  Good morning, and welcome, everyone. I'm Barry Pavel. I'm a senior vice president at the Atlantic Council, and I direct the Scowcroft Center on -- on Strategy and Security there. </p><p>      On behalf of the council, I'm really honored to -- to welcome you to our conversation with -- with President Kaljulaid of the Republic of Estonia, especially since this is her first public event here in Washington, D.C. And, Madam President, thank you so much for being -- for being here with us. </p><p>      Again, I'd also like to welcome those of you who are following the webcast online. Please feel free to join the conversation on Twitter, using the hashtag #USBalticSummit, and the account @cyberstatecraft.</p><p>      In today's discussion, we'll be touching on issues that -- that, in my view, will be key to the decade unfolding ahead of us, and those issues include artificial intelligence, blockchain and cyber-security, all matters on which President Kaljulaid has a strong voice and leadership, particularly given her presidency of a country undertaking what the New Yorker has called \"the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today.\"</p><p>      PAVEL:  Estonia has been at the cutting edge of the digital revolution since well before most of us were actually calling it a revolution.</p><p>      By the late 1990s, all of Estonia's schools were online. And since then, it's gone digital on all its government services and set up data embassies outside the country to safeguard that information.</p><p>      That's the kind of cyber foresight that we could use more of. And that's why we're so proud to have President Kaljulaid with us today.</p><p>      At the Atlantic Council, we've redoubled our efforts toward fostering an international community of like-minded states and reinvigorating an adaptive set of global norms and rules built on common principles such as openness, transparency and the rule of law. Sometimes we do that the old-fashioned way through diplomacy and summits, but we're also passionate about innovating wherever useful and needed.</p><p>Estonia's project of digital statecraft, or e-Estonia, perfectly mirrors that spirit of much-needed innovation. By leveraging technology to transform everything from voting to citizenship, Estonia has shown us how to bring these tried and tested values forward into this century.</p><p>      But of course introducing a digital -- digital element to governance also introduces risks, as Estonia itself knows very well from the cyber attacks of 2007. The very freedom and connectivity that makes our societies what they are, also opens us to malicious activities undertaken by those who oppose our values, as Lieutenant General McMaster outlined so passionately and eloquently before some of us at the Atlantic Council last evening in his final public remarks as national security advisor.</p><p>Estonia used the -- Estonia used the 2007 attack to turn its vulnerabilities into strengths, and it's now widely considered a global leader on cyber-security, with Tallinn hosting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.</p><p>      But it underscores the need for us to devote real resources to protecting our increasingly information-based societies. And though we are already doing much to safeguard ourselves, as General McMaster said, much more work remains to be done on all fronts and in very close coordination with our allies.</p><p>      And that's why at the Scowcroft Center we devote so many sustained efforts to strengthening cyber statecraft, working closely with key allies in every region of the world. And that's why we organize teams to visit the Baltics -- as we are doing next week, for example -- to engage more directly with our allies, to help shore up deterrence, defense and resilience against the foremost security challenges that we face.</p><p>      And with that, let me introduce President Kaljulaid and our moderator, Jim Sciutto, to -- to speak to both the promise and peril of digital statecraft.</p><p>      Before becoming the president of Estonia in 2016, President Kaljulaid served as a member of the European Court of Auditors from 2004 to 2016, where she organized the financial audit of E.U. R&amp;D funds, among many other leading responsibilities. She also was the economic adviser to the prime minister from 1999 to 2002, as well as CFO and CEO of the IRU power plant.</p><p>      Leading our discussion today will be Jim Sciutto, chief national security correspondent of CNN; most importantly, a Villanova fan, for those of us from that area.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      With his extensive experience reporting overseas across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, we couldn't have asked for a better guide for this conversation.</p><p>      He was the only American journalist to embed with U.S. special forces during the Iraq invasion, and he has reported undercover from inside Myanmar, and he reported Iran's first reaction to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union remarks.</p><p>      Before we turn to Jim and President Kaljulaid, I wanted to thank Baker &amp; McKenzie for hosting us today.</p><p>      Thanks very much.</p><p>      Thanks David Lashway, partner here at the firm, also for his continuous support of our cyber efforts at the Atlantic Council.</p><p>      And now let's get to the good stuff. Thanks again. And I'll hand it over to our esteemed panelists.</p><p>      Thank you very much.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Thank you for the kind introduction. Thanks so much to the Atlantic Council, Baker &amp; McKenzie, and -- and thank you, President Kaljulaid, for allowing me to sit across from you and throw a few questions your way.</p><p>      I've had -- I've had the good fortune of spending some time in Estonia and interacting with -- with Estonian officials, interviewed the foreign minister, as I've covered the Russian story and had some nice visits there as well. And I feel lucky for that. In fact, I spent my birthday last year in Estonia.</p><p>      And as you know, it just -- it's a remarkable position, I think, in what has become a dominant national security line for the U.S., as a neighbor to Russia, as one of the first victims of a coordinated Russia cyber attack in 2007; really unprecedented but -- but foreshadowing of things to come.</p><p>      And yet as a country, doubling down, all-in on the digitized society without hesitation and -- and with full confidence. And finding that (ph) way forward. Certainly a lot of lessons to be learned there, I think for -- for Europe and for the U.S.</p><p>      The subject today, of course, artificial intelligence, et cetera.</p><p>      I do want to start, if I can, just in light of your visit here and your time yesterday in the White House, I'm curious, do you have confidence that the U.S. is a solid partner for you as you face challenges from Russia, particular cyber challenges from Russia?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes, I have to say I have great confidence in this administration and in American people. And as I also said yesterday, this confidence is not unfounded (ph). It has foundation in this common, shared values (ph) which we all have. And (inaudible) that, and I think it's pretty obvious that we can have confidence.</p><p>      And I have to say that we've had really good cooperation with his administration (ph) since he took office. High-level visits. Physical (ph) visits. And lso discussions also on the side (ph), also while playing the same hand on - in the discussion (ph) -- for example, on nuclear weapons in 21st century, (inaudible) U.N. Security Council (ph) (inaudible) et cetera. So the contents are close and (inaudible). And this gives us confidence (inaudible). And it doesn't (inaudible).</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  If I could start on -- I want to get to artificial intelligence very quickly, but just on cyber, to describe to folks -- one thing that struck me when I was in Estonia is just the frequency of cyber attacks. This is -- this is a daily event, many times a day. These are the numbers of the way it works, right? It doesn't come in -- you know, in pairs or in dozens, it comes constantly.</p><p>      How is it today? And -- and -- and where are the attacks coming from? How aggressive are they? And how do you push back?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First of all, just because you can't see this in the United States, it doesn't matter. They exist, and I'm quite sure you also have systems where these attacks are (inaudible) and analyzed as we also learned that you have quite a number of them came from Russia. So nothing (ph) unique in Estonia. And this is how it is.</p><p>      In most of the cases you don't allow it (ph). You just deter and (inaudible) but we don't analyze where it comes from, because they are (inaudible).</p><p>      But (inaudible) or in case you see that someone is coming out (ph) (inaudible) systems, they're not (ph) (inaudible) analyze also where they came from.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  But in most of the cases, it simply doesn't give (inaudible) to deem this piece, because (inaudible) anyway and if it will not have a particular reason to -- to try to (inaudible). Then it just doesn't cooperate. It's just how cyber works, and I don't that it will ever change. This is how it is while...</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  The outgoing national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, said last night that -- and he's not alone in this. You've heard this from many members of the administration, but also from folks outside -- that the U.S. and the West have not yet imposed sufficient costs on Russia to deter activity -- and not just cyber activity, other activity -- in Ukraine, et cetera. Do you agree with that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I think there is considerable space to improve. What has (inaudible) and which has come to many peoples' mind is to go off of the Russian money (ph) that don't perceive to go out to something which were very good. Most of the (inaudible) happened that the discussion was whether or not to throw Russia out of the international money transfer (inaudible), another option, for example, but I think actions need to be proportionate, and meanwhile it's also wise to say that we've been talking as well.</p><p>      Talking all of this (inaudible) and understand this one is going to get as well (ph). (inaudible), this comes from only one source. This is the unit (ph), and we know that. We see it. We observe it very often that, for example, when there are attempts to break off from, let's say, all sanctions on Ukraine, then there is quite clever Russian persons assigned to understand where these attacks are going and trying to use this (inaudible) immediately.</p><p>      And I would even say that quite often Russia goes where it thinks that this total (ph) result may be neglecting this part of Europe or region. I think this happened in Georgia. I think this happened in Ukraine. These countries were trying and -- were trying to come closer to Europe for some time, and obviously Europe (inaudible) to provide (inaudible) and clear opportunity and possibilities on how to come (inaudible) members (ph). So we saw that things went wrong.</p><p>      And actually at the same line, in my mind (inaudible). Maybe there was an understanding that Euro-solidarity is broken because of Brexit. Now, (inaudible), and this is, of course, where we are as well.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  In the case -- in cases like this, where you have comprehensive and quite damaging cyber attacks, in your view, does Article V apply?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I'm quite sure that also if you read the academic analysis of what cyber might cause and that it can have as devastating consequences to a nation's security as conventional attacks, then I'm quite sure that we can imagine situations where Article V would apply. But until you have tested, you'll never know.</p><p>      On the other hand, you don't want to bring the threshold of calling Article V low, so it will always be a difficult question on how to move forward.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  But that is the Russian strategy, is it not, to pursue activities and attacks that are just below the perceived threshold of a coordinated response?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes, but when it becomes dangerous to a country's security and sovereignty, then you know that you have to go and say, \"This is an Article V situation.\"</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Now, did you consider that in 2007? Because this was quite -- I mean, this was an attack designed to cut Estonia off, right, in effect?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First of all, 2007 attack was in no way dangerous to Estonia's security, because what Estonia was able to do in 2007, it walled off the country. Inside the country, services was running, so Estonia was not down. What was down was the external connection to Estonia.</p><p>      I was in Luxembourg. I couldn't access my bank account, but all Estonians in Estonia could and the services were up and running. So it definitely was not an attack which could -- which could have actually been a risk to this country's security.</p><p>      In addition, it wasn't -- it wasn't very effective in -- in attacking the vital systems of the country. Digital government systems, yes. But I mean, nobody dies if they are down for two hours. They were mostly functional and they were just walled off from the rest of the internet world.</p><p>      The simple denial of the service attack, which nowadays is very common. So definitely, that would not have been an Article V case.</p><p>      But if you think of the whole 2007 situation, with Russia provoking also -- also while people were fighting on the streets for a couple of nights, et cetera, so you had -- you had a more dire situation than just a cyber attack and you had to see all of these facts together. That was a cyber attack combined with what else was going on in the country, and that is why the European partners and allies also came out in strong support of Estonia, calling out that this is Russian.</p><p>      And this is very important that this call came; that nobody then asked (inaudible) questions, et cetera, probably because they couldn't yet. I mean, this was not the common thinking then. Everybody was in shock and awe that cyber attack against a nation can exist at all.</p><p>      But nevertheless, the support was -- was -- as we see it today when something like this happens.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There was a good piece last week, I believe it was by Max Boot, who made the argument that the U.S. and NATO is, in effect, fighting the last war again; making that mistake of fighting the last war. That in this environment of hybrid warfare like you experienced in 2007 and see elsewhere today, that it's not about buying more littoral combat ships, right? That you need to focus on the right tools, whether they be offensive cyber weapons, et cetera.</p><p>      Do you have a concern that that's the case; that folks are looking backwards as opposed to forwards? Especially with Estonia that -- that by its very nature looks forward in terms of technology?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes. But first of all, just because you have newer kinds of risks doesn't make the old kind of risks disappear, unfortunately.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  (inaudible).</p><p>      KALJULAID:  If it were that, I would be extremely happy and maybe even welcome these new risks which are geographic (ph) in nature, because then, of course, our geopolitical seismic (ph) region will not be anymore geopolitically seismic (ph) because globally we are.</p><p>      And it's only partly a joke, but if you think seriously where Russia is ahead of us -- we know that NATO is stronger than Russia. But if you look at, let's say, eastern border of NATO and conventional capacities, then Russia has considerable might there.</p><p>      If you now think that you are -- you are seeing what is happening to our country's economy and technological development, because while Russia is very proud about Ukrainian sanctions and its own counter-sanctions by which Russia doesn't buy agriculture products anymore from European market, that it is now an independent -- well, independently able to feed its own population, then this is wonderful. You are primary sector exports (ph) and you are great agrarian country, 21st century.</p><p>      Something's missing. Technology's missing.</p><p>Russia is losing out on technology development because of our sanctions big time. I'm quite sure that if Georgia never happened, Russia would be part of the Horizon 2020 European R&amp;D program, because Georgia, for example, is participating in that program.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  So they must see that they're losing in their might. I mean, it's not so big country, it's not economically well off, and its prognosis is bad, so -- and you still have some conventional advantages somewhere, globally.</p><p>      I think this is particularly the time when you need to be vigilant in your analysis and in your response to be able to deter, if there were to be a sudden attempt to try to turn the tables. </p><p>      Therefore, we cannot neglect conventional risks, even if there are new risks. And I think it's more true today than, maybe, it was, I'd say, 10 years ago.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  You raise a point, which is something of a contrarian point of view here in the U.S., that -- that the perception that Russia is winning is misplaced; that, in fact, they're paying a very high cost in economic terms, technological terms.</p><p>      You know, if you -- if you -- you know, to echo, to some degree, as you did, Senator John McCain, Russia's a gas station, right? You know, the -- the -- you know, it's still basically a petrol economy. Not great to -- to travel...</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  What's that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well, nowadays, which is fine.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      You have to give a country credit it deserves.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Big picture, do you -- are you making an argument that Russia's losing strategically?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes. Strategically, Russia is losing. And, therefore, I think we need to take this very seriously -- what their analysis of the situation might be. </p><p>      What -- when will the window of opportunity of turning the tables suddenly on us close? We don't know this. We don't know what's the analysis, and we don't know, also, on a technical level, when is the moment.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Turning the tables meaning a catastrophic attack meant to...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Something going really wrong, yes. In conventional sphere, in somewhere else -- something like Salisbury -- I mean, we didn't -- if somebody had told you two months ago that this would happen, would you have thought it's probable? No. So I think we need to be very vigilant right now.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Do you -- do you envision that -- again, I'm asking you to predict, which I know that no politician likes to do. But -- but are you speaking in the cyber sphere? Are you speaking in the kinetic sphere, or -- could be a whole range?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I'm speaking in cyber sphere. And I think, Russia aside, we need to think much more seriously how we treat, internationally, the risks stemming from -- from the cyber, and also from the fact that we have more and more self-learning systems.</p><p>      And, also, I think we should think about -- that maybe Elon Musk and (inaudible) and others -- that they're right about A.I. And they put the probability of having A.I. at 50 percent at 2050. Well, I take this with -- pinch of salt, because I have a degree in genetic engineering.</p><p>      And, when I was starting in university in '90s, then, everybody was sure that we would clone people by 2010. And we are very, very far from that. So I don't know whether we should take it seriously. But at least I know this:  that we can create systems which are self-learning and pretty autonomous, looking like A.I. to most people. </p><p>      So we should actually understand what new kinds of risks stem from that. And I particularly love the -- the example of an -- of an -- close-to-A.I. or even A.I. war -- means (ph) somebody's nuclear system -- doesn't matter whose -- it -- this could be the system of an axis of good or an axis of bad. Doesn't matter, really. </p><p>      But imagine you have a war, and it's in somebody's system, and it's self-learning, and we sent it into the system thinking that we know what it will find as equipment (ph) -- the software in that system -- and then it finds something unexpected. For example, somebody has taken a contaminated computer to the system -- very common thing. Somebody read (ph) internet on the same computer, then connected it to some technical system.</p><p>      And this, our A.I. little war now (ph), reads this information. And this changes our understanding, because we thought it will only read and learn about the system, but he (ph) read a piece of news. And this piece of news said that United Nations getting ready to ban A.I. for military use.</p><p>      And this system is in the nuclear element, and it knows it is A.I., and it knows the system where it is is military. What will happen? And it's not as science fiction as -- as it sounds. Maybe this particular example still is, but I use it to explain that, I mean, we have loads of things which might come not necessarily from state and government actors. </p><p>      Artificial intelligence, as far as we see now, will not be created by a public actor. It will created, probably, by somebody else. Where? We don't know. When? We don't know. We know it hasn't been created, because, according to the current technology development, it would eat so much energy that we would notice that somewhere, globally, energy is being used to this extent.</p><p>      But it might happen. And we are not even discussing about how international law should apply, what should be our measures, counter-measures. </p><p>      For example, we could agree, at the United Nations level, that, if we detect that energy somehow being used in a concentrated way somewhere, or that somebody has built a neural-network-like computer network somewhere, this would trigger an inspection. </p><p>      Are we discussing it? No. We are only discussing the cyber, conventional, and failing even there to agree how exactly international law should apply in cyber sphere.</p><p>      I think we are so far behind the curve of where we should be. And I think this is now urgent discussion which you should be having. But you don't have many takers, I have to say.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There's a great quote, and I don't -- I can't quote it from memory, that -- that Putin said at a conference last year about -- the country that controls A.I. will dominate in a number of ways. And then I often read that quote at speeches, and ask folks who they think said it. And they always say, \"Elon Musk,\" or something like that.</p><p>      It's Putin. He's clearly thinking in these terms. Whose -- who, to our knowledge, is ahead on A.I.? China? Russia? The U.S.? Estonia?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  My guess is that it's in private sector, not in government sector right now. But, indeed, what -- I noticed this quote, and I was very worried. </p><p>      Because, normally, President Putin speaks -- he -- in his -- if we look back in retrospective -- I mean, all the discussion about geopolitical catastrophe of breaking down the Soviet Union, thereafter came tries to negotiate, then -- Georgia, et cetera -- sometimes you hear something -- well, we've heard very often, for example, that the Baltic states are very stupid to leave the Russian electricity grid, because, of course, it's very technically stable.</p><p>      And the -- which is true, by the way. It is technically very stable. Yet, we know that he spent a lot of money to make sure that his structures will not suffer if we are pushed off the grid suddenly. Right now, this is not still possible, but it is (ph).</p><p>      So this makes us to -- work with European Commission to make sure that we could be deconnected (ph) from -- from that grid as quickly as possible and connected to the European electricity grid even if, I mean, economically, it doesn't -- well -- make much sense to do this. But it's clear that, if you hear these things, you need to think about what that might mean. </p><p>      Similarly, there was a call for respect, and then Salisbury. So, indeed, we need to pay attention that artificial intelligence, if it happens in -- somewhere, then we need to detect it quickly. We need to detect it quickly, especially in case it will be in the -- on the axis of bad, not on the axis of good. But my guess is it will be private sector.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  So now I'm going to ask you to predict again. You said that folks, you know, years ago, predicted we'd already be cloning dogs and cats and human beings, and we're not there yet. How many years or decades off do you think the breakthrough is?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I cannot -- I'm not a specialist in that field. But, looking at -- again, at this benchmark of genetic engineering, then we cannot -- well, we can make bacteria with some characteristics which we wanted it to have; that's all. And we are eight years past the date we were supposed to clone human beings, so it might take time.</p><p>      But this doesn't change the fact that -- I mean, autonomous systems, self-learning autonomous systems can mimic pretty closely something which is A.I. It will not be a -- a science fiction, but it -- it may be nevertheless as dangerous, or almost as dangerous. It's just that it's easier to predict what it thinks -- well, \"thinks\" in quotation marks of course.</p><p>      But this example what I came about the war (ph) in nuclear system, this doesn't need to be A.I. It could be actually a -- a well-learning automated system just happening on the wrong piece of information.</p><p>      My example was understandable for us, but we are talking machines there. There might be other technical data which is not understandable for us right now here, which will actually push it off the course, and we need to be ready for these kind of developments.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  And -- and self-learning systems like that exist today?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes, we have self-learning systems playing really good board games, we know that.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  For a digitized economy like Estonia, which has created, of course, many jobs and opportunities for its population, but of course technology, as we know, often replaces human jobs with -- with machines, et cetera.</p><p>      Is -- is the approach of A.I. and -- and the existence of self learning something, you know, a rough equivalence today. What did that do to the future of work?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I think will do good to the future of work. First of all, already now we can see that the current mediocre level of technology was what the humankind is able to achieve is changing the work -- work already.</p><p>      I mean, the fact that I can work from Tallinn for somebody in America, or in France or in Australia demonstrated people don't need enterprises anymore to get the best added value of their skills. They don't need broad skills; they can be extremely narrow skills, and -- and they could sell them globally because you can sell them online, which poses a huge question -- who will get the taxes? And without taxes, we will not -- we will not be able to help our people to pass this transfer.</p><p>      Sometimes people think that the nature of the job will change only for well learned and educated people, but I think it is a great equalizing fact (ph), because you can -- you can actually be somebody who would (inaudible) something very classic, like handicraft, but you will be able to sell it globally.</p><p>      We have in Estonia this -- this case where is (ph) a South African man living in a small county in middle of nowhere basically in Estonia, and he makes bows and arrows. They're really good, I've -- I've understood, because they sell globally for a high price. And -- but he just prefers to live where, I mean, his clients -- the closest client I think was more than 2,000 kilometers away.</p><p>      So, an example, and even for handicapped people, let's imagine you have an -- well an autistic person who is ready to knit socks, but only red ones, probably in his vicinity he wouldn't find enough takers, and since he's incapable to socialize, he cannot sell. But online and globally probably he finds enough, I mean, these people who love just these red socks. So you can sell and -- and you can have a job. And previously, such a person would have been unemployed.</p><p>      So there are numerous ways of how they -- well the work is changing. And what I hate most is that let's tax robots and pay subsistence fees to people. And it always takes me back to the change from agricultural economies to industrial. What if we had taxed tractors and paid subsistence fees to agricultural workers who lost their jobs? Would they have taken up industrial jobs? They wouldn't. And I admit that this transfer was extremely painful, but it was painful because we didn't have social systems and dedication.</p><p>      So now our difficult equation is actually how to keep our social systems and dedication going when the traditional tax system is obviously going with traditional work system. We gathering every morning into an enterprise and working for (ph) the same enterprise, having home address and demanding services in one country globally. This is all going, and we've got to start talking about it right now.</p><p>      And my understanding is that in future, our country will be hub for people, a (inaudible) kind of. I've (inaudible) Estonia, but it provides me (ph) social and educational services, my children online tutoring in Estonia language wherever they are globally, but it doesn't necessitate me to have a postal address in Estonia or something. It's a deal between me and this country.</p><p>      And the problem of course is that if we are lazy in this thinking, then either we lose these services or they will all get privatized, which will actually lower their inclusivity, which might not be a problem for you here in America, but definitely for us in Europe, because our people expect us to provide a kind of school system, health system, health care system, which is available to almost (ph) everybody. So we are much more afraid of -- of these kind of developments, that (inaudible) tax base. But if we are rigid and say to people that unless you do it the old-fashioned way, we don't provide you with services, then they will opt out and go private, or simply go without, and then try to opt in, because only pension system penalizes late opt in. Health-care system does not penalize late opt in in any way; educational system for our children either.</p><p>      I mean, we need to figure it out, because otherwise we will lose the best proportion of earnings tax wise from the younger population.</p><p>      And if you look globally, U.K., Netherlands, Estonia, the number of independently working people is already radically grown, so I'm not talking about tomorrow; I'm talking today. And we need to really think about globally and internationally what to do about it.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  This is happening as we have -- we have a crisis of confidence in a whole host of institutions here in the U.S. I'm a member of the fake news media. You heard the president standing next to you make a reference to fake news yesterday.</p><p>      But it's affecting our technology companies as well. I mean, Facebook's position in the -- in the wake of Russian interference in the election. How much of a challenge is that? Do you see any similar loss of confidence or fear of big tech in Estonia, and if not, how -- how have you avoided that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  We feared Facebook as everybody else, of course. It's pretty obvious, but the difference is we have alternatives to Facebook. We have secure internet communication channels as well.</p><p>      And I've ran around the globe for a year and a half telling everybody that this is unfair that governments have left people and businesses in internet without governmental support, because in the real world or (inaudible) world, you don't imagine that you cannot identify the other person with whom you are talking or interacting or contracting, at least at that point -- at least you would ask for a passport. You don't board a plane without knowing that everybody has dutifully shown up their passports. So we know with whom we are flying all the time.</p><p>      For some reason, governments have failed to notice that their people and their businesses are in internet, and it's a big part of every transaction and quite a lot of communication change is online.</p><p>      And I think governments have exactly the same obligation in the digital sphere to provide people with identification. Estonians have had this way of establishing safe corridors in internet to communicate, because using your digital identity also will create an encrypted channel. So it is failsafe, and, second, you know with whom you're talking. And this kind of internet connection is not dangerous, so our people are not afraid of using -- of using digital signatures, but of course, they also worried about somebody taking their data on Facebook.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  And also we can differentiate. We know this. It's -- it's weird, but, well, I know people have fun with -- with these kind of things. For example, one of my friends heard this. Somebody told that, in Estonia, there exists a -- well, an ear (ph) doctor, and his name is -- is Dr. Ear (ph). So he -- she wanted to check whether this is really true, and she Googled, and, for two months, she afterwards got all kinds of ear remedies, hearing devices, these kind of advertisements.</p><p>      So people automatically assume that this is OK for kind of consumer services. But, for some reason, they didn't realize that, if this is going on, then, of course, this is going on also for political debate. </p><p>      And our people, since they can differentiate between safe and unsafe internet a little bit better -- because we have safe one, as well, and we are not forced to use the unsafe one if we don't want to -- then I think they are a bit more resilient than people elsewhere. </p><p>      Yet they are afraid, of course, and they simply don't use Facebook, in that case, of course, if they are afraid. Nobody would, anyway, contract over (ph) Facebook. I don't know. That would be weird, so.</p><p>      Also, I've noticed that, in Estonia, people pay for internet time. If they have transacted and signed a contract, then you don't use a credit card for payment, but you use safe channel. You go to a bank, log in online and make an online payment. It doesn't take much longer, but is much safer. People prefer this and consider this safer than using credit cards online.</p><p>      But they do it because it's as comfortable. If it were more comfortable, or not possible, comfortably, to pay -- you'd need to walk to bank office, for example -- then, they would use credit cards. So it has to be. </p><p>      The -- the good internet has to be comfortable and available, and it starts from identification. I cannot repeat this often enough. It's our obligation as -- as governments to realize people have to have safe identification means in the internet sphere, as they have in real life.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  You have the advantage of having a genetic engineering degree, so -- very aware of -- of the health implications of a highly digitized society, particularly as it relates to privacy. </p><p>      In light of what you were just discussing, social media, et cetera, how do you -- how do you handle those? Because, of course, no one is more concerned about their privacy than when it comes to -- to health information.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I think all Estonian politicians always ask this question from all audiences:  Do you know who read your doctor's notes last? Was it your doctor, or somebody you don't know? When we in Estonia -- if somebody reads our -- I don't know, tax declaration, health information -- you know.</p><p>      But, I mean, sometimes people think that Estonia is -- is a kind of wild world of -- world of internet. It isn't. It's actually a much stronger regulated world of internet. Our government has given people numerous guarantees that they will know if somebody's -- looks around in their data. </p><p>      We also gather genetic information of all our people. It's another legally permissive environment -- result of Estonian way of having a state. We -- we know much more of our -- our people's, well, genetic data -- common markers for common ailments (ph). </p><p>      And we are enlarging this project, and -- and people are not afraid to participate, because state has given guarantees about how this data is to be handled. Even your doctor wouldn't see it if you don't want it. But then, probably, you don't want, first, to have this, and this is, of course, voluntary, whether you do or you don't.</p><p>      So we have Estonian Genome Foundation, created at the same time as, more or less -- as the digital Estonia, and it's very similar in -- in what we did in digital. We probably have done other things, but they have not flied (ph). This flied (ph). </p><p>      It flied (ph) for short term, from 2000 to 2003, because, you know, we created this environment where population and genetics was legal, and it wasn't in most countries, globally. It was in Iceland. Iceland was our only competitor, but, luckily, they have even tinier population. So, to do population genetics in a population of 300,000 is -- is more of a joke than doing it in 1.3 million, which is still a joke, but something.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      So private companies flocked in and paid for founding Estonia Genome Foundation. It was done on investment banking finance only. But then what happened? The governments came in. The other governments, entering (ph) the market, because they, of course, started to buy all these services, because, of course, companies were clever enough to say that you have to pay. It's not enough to create legal space.</p><p>      And then, for 10 years, it was dormant until the technology became so cheap that, now, we can continue with -- with helping our people to understand the genetic risks of having heart attack, or diabetes II and other of these common ailments.</p><p>      But, again, very often, people ask, then, that \"Are you afraid of\" -- and we say no, because we know that this data is protected. The state knows how to protect data. And -- and it's in -- it's still in my ownership. </p><p>      I mean, yes, it is in some kind of a database, but I own it. It's not state's. It's mine, and I decide who uses it, and how. Personally, I don't mind if you know that my diabetes II risk is higher, and it is. But that's fine with me, so I can tell it openly.</p><p>      And I think it's important we work on these areas, as well, because 90 percent of the world's population, when they feel sick, what do they do first? Google. Nowadays, what you have on Google is mostly rubbish medical information. </p><p>      But you need to have solid alternatives for people. So medical doctors need to have access to people's data -- of course, without names and everything, so -- to analyze and create self-learning medical doctors who are able to respond to people.</p><p>      NHS in Great Britain is experimenting, actually, that, if people call in the emergency line, and it's established that, in fact, it's not an emergency, then they are trying, with -- with a robot, to try to, well, direct this person to go to pharmacy or to go to doctor or whichever way. </p><p>      But these systems have to have databases to learn. And donating your information to them -- health information or genetic information -- in an anonymous format is a great thing to do for humanity. But it needs to be safe, and it can be safe.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  But -- but how could you -- I guess the issue is, even with regulation, the question becomes confidence, right, and confidence in security, because I'm someone -- and listen, I -- I have such a baseline level of -- of digital knowledge, but -- but I have an assumption -- and this is partly because of the work that I do, but I -- also, I lived in China -- I have assumption that there is no actual privacy, because I've been a victim of -- of three or four -- of the three or four biggest hacks:  the OPM hack, the Anthem Healthcare one, and I forget what the other one -- I've lost track. </p><p>      I have so many free digital ID services paid for by various entities that mishandled my information, I -- I don't even know. So how do you get those two to come together? Because you could have that knowledge, but, without confidence, then, you know...</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First thing first. This is the big problem of developing digital country like Estonia:  Lots of digital services provided online, indeed, with identification ways -- I don't know. You use some username and some code, and then you write it on your computer, have a special file in your computer, et cetera. It's unsafe, terribly unsafe.</p><p>      Or take a very -- it's a concrete example. I got it from Rudy Giuliani -- or I put the example together, but I learned from him. E-prescription's pretty popular in United States, but it's an e-mail. I'm sorry. </p><p>      And, when something goes wrong with this e-mail, e-prescription, then confidence in all e-prescriptions is down the drain, including ours. But our e-prescription system is much safer. You -- you can never say it's absolutely safe, but it's definitely safer than paper analogs (ph), so I'm quite sure I call it safe. </p><p>      But, when something goes wrong in one service, people lose trust in others. And that is where we need to go up (ph) the confidence and trust of all our people, constantly explaining to our people where we differ.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  We are not, I mean, holding this to (ph) ourselves. Actually, we very much like to expand our -- our X-Road, what we call, which is our identification system.</p><p>Finland is using the same, and we can change real -- real-time data with them. We don't, because we haven't sold it legally, but, technically, we already can, if -- for example.</p><p>      So we are open to others to use ours or similar systems. We are not telling that you cannot do it. But, if you come with us into this world, you have to take responsibility to -- explaining to your people how these services work. </p><p>      And, in addition, you have to promise that you make some promises to your people about how -- and then you have to apply this in your law base (ph) -- how you use this data, how you protect this data, what is your obligation vis-a-vis your people in case you have this data.</p><p>      For example, I would absolutely refuse to distribute our X-Road's technology to a company for -- which I knew that it has, let's say, only one single database where it tends to gather all the information about its citizens, et cetera.</p><p>      But, I mean, if you do it in a smart -- smart and sharp way, and protect this, also, legally, what you are doing, and protect your people, it can be done, not only in Estonia, but all that's following (ph). Denmark is quite good example, Luxembourg is quite good example. We are small, but it's something.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Before -- I do want to go to the audience soon -- I do want to ask you about blockchain, because I know this is at the top of your list of interests.</p><p>      Is the -- and, just out of curiosity, and you know far more than me -- but the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble, or at least the volatility there -- is that a just a bump on the road towards all the potential of blockchain technology?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Well, do we want to talk blockchain or Bitcoin? Let's agree on that first?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  It's an example.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Totally bad example. Let's take, then, Bitcoin.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      And, for Bitcoin, you don't need to be a -- a well -- well-established macroeconomists to understand that money needs economy, and a link to a real economy. Then you know whether you have too much money, too little money, is it overvalued, undervalued -- all this. </p><p>      I ask you, where's the underlying economy of Bitcoin? There isn't. Or, if there is, then we cannot measure it; therefore, we cannot understand what's the value of Bitcoin. This much about Bitcoin -- I mean, this is an illusion. </p><p>      This has an interesting afterthought, if I think more about the Bitcoin situation. A well-known A.I. example says that A.I. is dangerous because it will make the world into paper clips. And then people say, \"No, no. A.I. will not be so stupid as to make the world into paper clips.\"</p><p>      And I've also thought that maybe it wouldn't. But, now, I mean, we are not A.I. We are human beings, and we mine Bitcoin. We spend real-life resources to the detriment of our environment -- lots of energy, et cetera, and other resources -- to mine something which has absolutely no value. So, I mean, where exactly are we better than A.I., here, in this problem?</p><p>      Now, to blockchain, this is different thing. Blockchain is a technology which allows different systems to keep track about what different systems around it, with which it is connected, are doing. And we think this is very useful technology. </p><p>      It's -- it's one step forward from what we have, because our digital signature, for a normal person, would look pretty much like blockchain, because it's signature and it's timestamped. It's similar enough for experts to look for the authors (ph) of Bitcoin in Estonia, but it's not the same technology.</p><p>      So blockchain allows -- for our case, we think it will allow our state to go proactive in offering services. How? Right now, we still have to apply for state digital services, one by one. For example, you have a child. You register the birth, then you apply for social services.</p><p>      But our people are starting to ask this question that -- I mean (ph), \"Government, you promised you would only ask once. Now, you have the information that I have a baby, and we are entitled to a certain payment for this baby.\"</p><p>      It's not relevant how much you earn, we have universal child support in Estonia. \"So why on earth, government, you now force me to apply, even if I can do it online? Why I need to go to some home page and, I mean, ask for this service? You can simply provide it to me. I have a baby. You know my bank account, because it's -- I pay taxes. And you know I'm entitled to this money. So why should I ask?\"</p><p>      And the answer is, because we don't have blockchain. Our systems do not have the capacity to make sure that -- I mean, one system -- what one system is doing -- that something's not going wrong at the same time at -- in the different system. Blockchain will help us to solve this problem.</p><p>      Our pilot is not social -- social security, because this is a high-confidence-level-demanding service. Our pilot there is traffic accident -- simple traffic accident, which happens every day. I mean, two cars get a little bit ruined. It's an insurance case. And we think that we -- by using blockchain, we can solve it in 30 minutes -- all the administrative questions.</p><p>      So you register your traffic accident. We have, of course, online car registry, and all these elements are there -- online insurance, full database of insurance schemes, et cetera. So we could, actually, in 30 minutes, we think, send information to both parts (ph) of the accident, and -- about how this incident was solved. </p><p>      But, for this, we need to have blockchain, which makes us also to think that -- when is the point when we need to create a legal entity for an -- learning -- or a machine learning system, or a machine system? And we feel we are coming quite close to this point. So we are now discussing exactly with -- how to regulate -- how to regulate, well, autonomous systems in our law base.</p><p>      Attribution questions will rise. And then, of course, it will be an interesting question. I think I read it this morning in one Estonian daily (ph) -- it -- lawyers were discussing that, if a robot kills somebody, then how do we know that the robot did not get the order from its owner to kill somebody, but simply went crazy? </p><p>      And, I mean, it's -- it's not -- I mean, it's not a laughing matter. This is the questions we need to solve. And also, for our -- this proactive state, we need to solve this question, and, yet again, we need to solve the question of privacy. </p><p>      People probably need to somehow opt in to this kind of system, understanding and analyzing, themselves, whether they want to use or they don't want to use this. </p><p>      So it's not easy, but we are thinking forward and we are forced to think forward, because, exactly, people are asking, \"You know this. Why do I need to apply at all?\" It's people who want this. </p><p>      And government, once it has undertaken this digital disruption of society, cannot back off. You have to continuously, all the time, first of all, make sure that the existing systems are still safe to use, that you can patch them up if something goes wrong and that you can continue developing.</p><p>      And it is also true that, sometimes, things go wrong. We have at least two means of identification online. Yesterday, for two hours, one of them was down. The other was working. So we need to have alternatives. But the problem with our country is that you cannot have digital with paper alternative. You have to have digital with digital alternative.</p><p>      And -- and we had this problem last year, where there is a chip maker, whom I wouldn't name, but maybe some of you know, which actually called 1 billion chips off the market, said that they aren't safe to use. </p><p>      Most of these were door cards (ph). High number was actually ID cards, but mostly in the countries which -- where people have IDs, but don't use them. So they could be simply, well, shut down for a while.</p><p>      We couldn't do it. For us, it was right that (ph) the service continues, because our people refused it otherwise. They wouldn't go to offices to queue for services. </p><p>      KALJULAID:  They even got really angry that -- because some of them finally -- most of them could solve the problem online, but some couldn't. And they had to go to a police or border guard office. And then, we got loads of complaints that -- oh, kidding (ph), I had to queue for an hour. And I mean, and then you explain to people that people in Western Europe normally take a day off to register their car.</p><p>      So this is where you have your population, and this also demonstrates to you that whatever Estonian government wants you to do -- go completely back to paper-based system for example -- it simply cannot. Disruption has happened, and now you have to live with the consequences and work forward to make sure that you are actually -- well, continuing to provide services to your people, to their satisfaction.</p><p>      Which means that even we are on the Mars already, our people want us to be even further. I mean so, Earth for them is not the solution.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  So wait, should we buy up block chain, or -- I wasn't clear. I'm joking.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      I got the answer loud and clear. OK, so we're going to go to the -- to the assembled audience here for questions. I think we have about a half hour. Gentleman in the back with his hand raised? And there are -- yes, there are microphones.</p><p>      Please if you can, identify yourself. And the other guidance I always give is phrase it in a question rather than a statement or a speech.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      QUESTION:  Michael Shraig (ph) with MIT.</p><p>Estonia is a very small country, as you pointed out. China, huge country. United States, huge country. Key to making machine learning work is scale. You're a small -- you're a scientist, you're from a small country, but you deal with giants and behemoths.</p><p>      What's the most important thing you've learned about managing scale in an environment where petabytes and zettabytes is the future of what you're talking about?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First thing to realize is indeed that scale wise, we don't create technology. We use technology quite common in private sector globally, so we don't have to carry the cost, and we fully understand that we don't control the delivery chain of this technology.</p><p>      And this is why we need to make sure we're using, let's say, these digital chips, that we also have mobile I.D., for example, because we simply don't control the technology. But this is what makes it available.</p><p>      If you now look more locally in Estonia, then since we've had absolute inclusivity, this digital chip is part of our I.D. card, with which we travel as well, at least within the European Union. Then this inclusivity from the other side is (inaudible). So for local services actually, companies have it quite good. They have the 1.3 million market at least, immediately at their hand.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Gentleman here?</p><p>      QUESTION:  I thank you for your comments today. Two questions, one -- are (ph) there related. One is recently Estonia joined a number of other countries, including the U.S., in condemning the NotPetya worm and attributing it to Russia.</p><p>      This is always a delicate question when you have this kind of collective response. What -- attribution the other day is a -- is a, you know, political issue. What level of confidence do you need, does Estonia need, to join that kind of collective because it's more powerful?</p><p>      And then on Russia, what kinds of actions would you think would be effective in actually deterring their behavior in cyberspace? You said that we need to do more. McMaster said that last night. What kinds of things would actually work?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  In cyberspace, we need monitoring, and we need to agree that international monitoring is allowed, and that there will be elements and events which will trigger international monitoring, very similarly as you have with (ph) sensitive nuclear technology globally. We need to agree what it is.</p><p>      I give you a few examples. Radical shift in energy consumption in some laboratory or somewhere is one thing. Second is now we understood that we need to create the, like, neural networks to be able to think of A.I. which will not consume so much energy that it will be dead immediately. These could be regulated. This is hardware after all. This could be regulated that you need to allow international monitoring, and this -- well, we need to bring in globally all countries. Because as I said, it's not anymore enough like in the nuclear case, that some countries agree and the rest will simply, well, accept because they don't have the weapons. It's global, and we don't know where it will -- where it will happen. So this much for regulation.</p><p>      For confidence level, it's not quantitative; it's always qualitative analysis, and depends -- well it very much, you have to go case by case.</p><p>      But it's interesting that we're joining (ph), because for us it's a solidarity act, because NotPetya didn't pass in Estonia, only in one international company system, which was not linked to Estonian system. Pure (ph) act of solidarity.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Is there a mic?</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Yeah, it's coming.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Fran Burwell from the Atlantic Council.</p><p>      Two questions. First off, when you are thinking about how to deter or respond to an attack, does it matter if it is a nation-state behind it, or whether it is organized crime, or is it the same response?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Same.</p><p>      QUESTION:  And -- OK. And the other thing is, you raised the issue of taxes. But your approach to tax sounds a little bit different for me from what has been proposed by some E.U. governments, including in terms of taxing digital enterprises, which, as you're well aware, some people here fear is aimed primarily at some large U.S. companies in Europe. Can you be a little bit more specific about where you think taxes should go to counter this -- to deal with this new world?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I can be a little bit more specific. Fully aware that first of all, I am in -- I'm in contradiction with much of the European thinking, plus OSCE (ph) rules, everything. So we absolutely need to modify international space, and we cannot go alone. So we need to first understand that, I mean, we have this problem, and then we need to start seeking solutions. And voluntary declaration of (inaudible) with any chosen state would be actually something, which probably is the -- is the solution to the problem. And I realize I'm -- that we are very far from -- from getting there.</p><p>      Meanwhile, Europe is doing what they always do in these kinds of systems. You apply a patch, and then you see what you can do to solve -- solve the problem as it is. And I think applying patches meanwhile to make sure that society is at least accepting that, I mean, we do need to tax differently, just because internet exists, is -- is a step in right direction. Of course it can be inhibitive to -- to some investment and so on. And I'm not necessarily supporting it, but I see where it comes from politically.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Gentleman standing in the back?</p><p>      QUESTION:  I'm Basil Scarliss (ph). I've been involved in foreign affairs.</p><p>      And I have a question on sanctions. Perhaps a good way to deter Russian cyber attacks and other meddling and military action would be to have a more effective regime for punishing the Russian leader and the oligarchs.</p><p>      And one obstacle is that in the United States, and to some extent in the United Kingdom, we allow shell companies to purchase properties, to make investments in corporations and in other organizations without revealing the beneficial owner; they can hide behind an attorney.</p><p>      The question I have, is do you think it would be much more effective to have targeted sanctions, especially if we could get Congress to pass appropriate legislation?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Simple answer would be yes.</p><p>      Then the political answer would be doesn't concern me, because Estonia doesn't have that much oligarchic money in the country. It's a tiny economy, completely transparent as well, because digital makes it also transparent.</p><p>      And -- and the practical answer is that I think yes, but we must make sure that we remain rule-of-law countries while we do it, as well. This is very important.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  If I could follow on that, this issue comes up -- it came with the response to Skripal attack -- that the next level would have been true financial penalties for people in power.</p><p>      You'll often hear -- whether with Ukraine, U.S. election interference -- about going after Putin's money, whether freezing it or exposing it to -- to his people -- all of his various holdings around the world.</p><p>      Why hasn't that happened yet, in your view?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I simply don't know.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Good answer. </p><p>      There's a group of folks here, but maybe I'll just go from the forward, back. There's a gentleman, and then behind two, and we'll go from there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hans Binnendijk from SAIS. First of all, let me say it's so refreshing to hear a president be able to converse the way you do on these issues. </p><p>      I'd like to ask about Russian attacks using social media. This is below the denial-of-service level. What has been your experience -- not just in Estonia, but in a -- in the Baltic States in general -- with regard to Russian use of social media to try to affect the opinions of your minorities -- Russian-speaking minorities?</p><p>      What have you been able to do about that? I presume you're countering it. And what lessons do you have for us in this area?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First, Baltic states -- well, I cannot say we have seen more of these kind of attacks. I think Germany has had a fair share, and visa case (ph) -- every German knows it. And -- and Emmanuel Macron called Putin out on disrupting the French election processes. </p><p>      We have been expecting and preparing for -- when EFP (ph) was established -- that we will have quite some. Lithuania had one, but the reaction was so quick -- retaliation from Lithuania -- to inform people that this is false news, to make sure that everybody got it -- it was false news -- was so good.</p><p>      But we've actually not seen any further elements. But we are, of course, ready all the time. And the only way to be ready is to tell your people this exists. We talk about troll factories. We show people that they do exist. And, frankly, try to read anonymous internet commentary under some article about -- I don't know, I do it under my articles about myself.</p><p>      I recognize a troll writing quite soon. They are trying to put a message out about you, which comes whichever way -- I mean, it -- it comes. And you have a few -- few kind of names which always will appear. And then you learn to recognize it.</p><p>      And -- and people, having live in -- lived a long time in the internet sphere, learn to understand this. Of course, we all have a big problem that most of the population is not able to differentiate between journalism -- something which pretends to be journalism and -- and something which think it is journalism, because they are -- well, I think those people who don't realize that they are not journalists, but they do -- don't do it in bad will.</p><p>      And, previously, I expected journalists to check their facts when they provide them to me. For some reason, I cannot do it, and I think here is also a frank discussion to be had, because lots of fakes new -- fake news will die if people knew that the safe channels will never pick them up. Yet safe channels stay after they (ph) pick them up.</p><p>      And we need to radically think how to avoid this. First of all, we all need to start paying for our online news, and then we can continue this discussion. I'm sorry it starts with that. Currently, the media sector has no resources to deal with it.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There's a couple questions coming in from Twitters (ph). So, Madam President, this one is, \"We have an obligation to explain the issues around privacy and responsibility to citizens,\" relevant to what you were just discussing. \"How has Estonia brought citizenry to a level where they can understand the explanation?\"</p><p>      And I'm -- I could identify with this, because, I'm sure, like you, you agree to terms that you don't know or read what those terms are, frequently. And so how do you manage that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  We have only one set of terms, and this is state-guaranteed digital identity. It's not too much to ask people to understand one set of terms and conditions. </p><p>      And the terms and conditions are roughly the same. You keep your identity -- physical one -- separate from the passwords. And, if this, for some reason, was not the case, you run quickly or go online quickly somewhere where you can, well, just close your identity.</p><p>      This is the basic drill. But we have to do it only one copy, because we have the universal system. And that is how we can build trust. And, of course, it is -- government is on the line. </p><p>      It's government which is giving this currently. It's not Google or Amazon or -- or somebody anonymous or not in your country. And I'm sorry -- it wouldn't get better unless more governments take this responsibility.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  (Inaudible) gentleman in the beard, and then -- well, actually, you both have beards. So...</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      ... we'll just have to go to -- left to right.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hey. Matt Leonard with Government Computer News. </p><p>      Can you talk briefly about the data embassy that you guys opened up last summer, what its current role is and any plans for opening up other data embassies, going forward?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  There's not much to talk about. It's a simple thing. Every private enterprise has a safe copy of everything it has, and, if the country's legal base allows it, has it outside of the country.</p><p>      Now, we have a copy of Estonian state, every minute, every moment, in -- in a data embassy. And, since it is state and state data and we need to make sure that our law base about this data and what applies to this data will apply to where it is, we cannot simply establish a server somewhere. </p><p>      We need to have an agreement with Luxembourg, also a very digitally minded and forward-looking country, that we will create a data embassy. So this server park (ph) is a sovereign territory of Estonia, and these servers and this data is -- belong to Estonian state. And, again, there is nothing technologically interesting.</p><p>      Interesting thing is law space, which we two together created, between Luxembourg and Estonia. Whether we need to have more copies -- well, time will tell. But I am quite sure that people would -- would be quite happy to host Estonian data embassy. </p><p>      On the other hand, other states need data embassies too. So -- they all have data which they need to store.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  And just -- I'm curious. Are those updated constantly, then? Because, if my -- my -- if I'm an insurance company, I don't know -- today's data is different from next week's data?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes. As I said, all Estonian digital signatures are timestamped. So, in this sense, they are like blockchain, yes.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  And then did you (ph) -- if you still have a question -- the gentleman here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you very much. Grigory (ph) (inaudible) of Russian news agency. So, first question, how -- do you think Estonia needs more NATO (ph) troops to deter Russia? And, if so, how many troops do you need?</p><p>      And the second one is about Skripal poisoning. So Estonia expelled a Russian diplomat, and -- but British experts said yesterday that they don't know a region of the agent that poisoned Skripal and his daughter.</p><p>      So do you -- do you still believe your actions to expel Russian diplomat was justified? And do we (ph) have any evidence of Russian involvement in these poisoning? Or this is just a matter of solidarity with European countries?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  As most countries trace (ph) -- they didn't send out simply diplomats. They sent out diplomats who were acting in a way as diplomats shouldn't act. So there was another reason for -- for this concerted action.</p><p>      What -- what concerns NATO troops, then -- NATO deterrence is -- well, has a history of being 100 percent efficient and effective. NATO has never failed to protect its territory. And it's -- in its entirety.</p><p>      And we trust into this capacity to deter. And we're quite sure that all NATO steps are always adequate to make sure that this deterrence is -- is -- is valued.</p><p>      In the summer, NATO summit will come together and discuss again those issues and these -- those elements. Our role there is to provide honest and open analysis of the security situation, considering conventional risks around our territory and among those -- well, is the information, which we have also talked publicly.</p><p>      Today, the level of conventional capacity surrounding NATO's eastern flank is at the level of 2009 Zapad exercise. We need to draw conclusions from that.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  In the far back here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hi.</p><p>      So, I've read that there are efforts to use blockchain technology in order to -- for example, in the Estonian stock exchange, to make voting easier and more secure and like it -- you know, immutable ledger and all that. You know, it's distributed.</p><p>      There's also efforts in Australia to -- company called My Vote, I think, to utilize the -- you know, relatively secure and distributed immutable ledger to help voting. And I've also heard the idea for voter registries.</p><p>      So I'm just curious, is Estonia considering using blockchain for voter database -- or yeah, voter registry databases, or e-voting -- like direct e-voting itself for candidates, or for referendums at the local level or at the larger level?</p><p>      Because I've heard that. It's an interesting idea and Estonia seems to be a little bit on the cutting edge of using those technologies.</p><p>      So yeah, just blockchain in voting systems basically is the question.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Basically, we have e-voting and this system is tried and tested and free for everybody to try and hack. And voting is the highest confidence level digital service, so you change our voting technology only when you have tried and tested the new technology developments. And you have taught your people that this technology is safe.</p><p>      On lower confidence level of services, voting should be the last which will shift technology, once you already have an established system of secure voting, which we have.</p><p>      So I predict that all other Estonian public services will be blockchain based before our e-voting system will change.</p><p>      And I always tell to other countries, some -- some countries would say, \"Let's start from e-voting.\" And I always say, \"That's a terribly bad idea. Start from school applications or something really -- well, low-worry services. Never start from e-voting.\"</p><p>      You have to teach a population cyber hygiene first. You have to teach them to trust the system. And only then you should apply -- you should try to apply this technology to high-confidence level services like voting.</p><p>      On the other hand, sometimes we get discussion that e-voting must be terribly unsafe. And it comes from people who vote by post, so beats me how this discussion can come up, but it does still come up.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Well, it's a very common fear here, though. I think you would -- I can't imagine a -- and, of course, it's run by states here, but I can't imagine a state legislature who'd push hard for it today, because there is that lack of confidence.</p><p>      Question from Twitter here:  \"Madam President, you speak about the need for government-mandated digital identity. Many people are concerned that this gives too much power to governments. Do you see a need for anonymous transactions? And if so, in what cases?\"</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Well, I'm -- in my character, I'm a simple housewifish politician, and -- and this philosophical question has been bothering me a long time now. Why people in free world trust their banks and Google and Amazon, but don't trust their government?</p><p>      And I don't -- I don't know the answer, but I think we need to have some really good philosophers and social scientists analyzing this question.</p><p>      It's not technology what they are mistrusting. They are not trusting, for some reason, their government. I don't know why.</p><p>      It may be different in every society. There may be similarities. I come from a society where people trust government in this sense. They don't trust it for, I don't know, having -- having a good tax system, or actually our people are very, very critical about our -- our government. It's a national tradition to think we are a badly run country.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      I'm not joking. I mean, in 1943, the chairman of the Bank of England, Lord Wedgwood, he said that Estonia was the best-run country in northern Europe. And then one of our politicians said that the other diplomats told him that, and it's astonishing how little your people appreciate it.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      It's still the same.</p><p>      But they trust government when government provides digital services.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There's a gentleman here along the aisle, and then we'll go to the back. I think we're getting down to probably the last question or two.</p><p>      QUESTION:  All right, thank you. Johnathan Lynchman (ph) from the Providence Group.</p><p>      You've mentioned a couple of times about educating the public, cyber hygiene. And I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what Estonia does with respect to public education on cyber-security and public information, in terms of making sure that it's both effective and that it reaches everyone.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Well, teaching hygiene is not as effective as, I don't know, applying some social services. It never will be, because if you think about when we taught people simple hygiene, it was also a lengthy process which gradually reached our people's brains. That you have to wash hands, otherwise you will fall sick; or you have to use toilets, because it's not hygienic to just go to the wood.</p><p>      And it took us time. But I think we have nowadays much better communication means to teach our people cyber hygiene.</p><p>      And the truth is, we have to start from this and many people haven't done it. Technology will not solve it. There will never be a technology which will be able to cover for all human errors. The only way is to tell people that, \"You are responsible.\"</p><p>      And the way to do it is education. I mean, you have to teach people at school about the risks of internet. We have (inaudible) police which goes around the schools and teaches children. And it also teaches them that it's just -- I mean, if it's not nice to be rude toward, well, the other kids in class in real life, it's as rude in internet, et cetera. It starts from this low-level thing.</p><p>      On the other hand, I recognize that most countries are now in bigger difficulty than Estonia, because we started teaching cyber hygiene at the turn of the century. And then the risk was some virus, and you just downloaded Kaspersky or something else. And -- and then it was cleared. Now you have to jump into the internet of things.</p><p>      Yet saying that it's impossible doesn't -- I mean, doesn't solve the problem, so we have to try. And I think it has to go down to (inaudible) and primary education, this cyber hygiene teaching.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Oh, right here in the front. And then we'll go to the back, if that's OK. Sorry, I'm having you...</p><p>      QUESTION:  I can -- I -- I'm pretty loud. I'm Claudia Jona (ph) from the Atlantic Council.</p><p>      What is your take on the -- on the -- (inaudible) deadlock (ph) on the global discussion on cyber norms? What is your take on -- on why the discussion -- where it's where it is right now?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I'm disappointed that the process in United Nations fell through. And I'm quite sure that we need to revive it.</p><p>Estonia, among other things, have decided to run for United Nations Security Council, and we are in the active phase of campaign. And whether we win or we lose, this is in our talking points about discussing global security.</p><p>      New Zealand took climate to the Security Council. We will take digital to the Security Council. And when we are elected, and we hope we will be, this is (inaudible) platform, definitely, and we need to continue.</p><p>      There was a working group. Marina Coleron (ph) from Estonia was -- was -- was responsible for that work as well, and -- and we were deeply disappointed when this got stalled. But the problem has not gone away.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  In the back, here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Madam President, Franica Jerka (ph), Broadcasting Board of Governors. </p><p>      In this city, there is ongoing discussion how to counter Russian propaganda (inaudible). So my question is, do you believe the blocking of Russian TV channels, like it was made in Ukraine, like it will -- it will be in Moldova, in other countries, is an efficient measure? And the second question, do you think is it a good time for now, especially now, for Western countries -- United States, European Union -- to create, re-create, revive (inaudible) broadcasters like Voice of America or PRL (ph) in Baltic states or central European countries? Thank you.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I don't believe in restricting access to media outlets, even if I don't think they are free media outlets. I believe in telling my people that these are not free media outlets, so this is something which pretends to be media, or it's a government-run media. And we in Estonia, we do not restrict access to these media, yet we discuss this -- these channels and -- and everybody's free to choose whether, for example, to talk to them, and to -- how to react to them. But it needs to be known, and this is important.</p><p>      But we need to not only think in the terms of Russia here. I think it would help everybody in this discussion to realize that the sources of fake news are numerous actually. I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty tough on Russia, but, I mean, sometimes I feel that people attribute all the problems in the global world to Russia. </p><p>      Fake news can come from everywhere. There are various reasons for producing fake news, including somebody may simply want to sell their products, and -- and do away with somebody else's. I don't know. Somebody could say that Asics -- Asics running gear is -- is dangerous to your legs, and that doctors have analyzed and realized that because the first and -- and the back kind of padding are separate -- which is not the case for Nike running shoes -- it's dangerous. </p><p>      So I mean, we have to analyze this in general, and need to teach our people how to check the facts. On the other hand, again, we need to get back a media space which we can trust somehow.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  I think this -- well, let's see. Maybe we have time for two more up there quick. There's a lady here, and then someone who I keep forgetting to go to in the way, way back.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you very much. Susan Ness, SAIS Center for Transatlantic Relations.</p><p>      We talked extensively about the fake news issue. Also, within the European Union, there are efforts underway with respect to hate speech, to curtail that through government regulation. We'd like to know whether there is a major hate speech problem within Estonia, and if so, what role should government play in curtailing hate speech? Thank you.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First of all, I don't sense that we have a big hate speech problem in Estonia. Second, I think that good habits is something which you shouldn't always try to write into the law text, because if we do away with good habits, and only go by law, then we are not the humankind. We like it, and we want it. So I don't believe in regulating everything.</p><p>      I think most people can recognize when it is hate speech. When -- when it goes to the territory that considerable losses are occurred (ph) to the other party by -- by something which has been said, then we have our court system, which can provide and solve (ph), even in the current legal space, for these cases. But I don't think that, well, you should legislate something you cannot define, really.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  So this will have to be the final one. And I can only see your hand, so I can't say -- oh, there you are.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hi. How do you -- I mean, in terms of the ever-evolving capabilities of A.I., how long until you think machines will supplant the human workforce? And what will the workforce do with their newfound time? And I guess that's the end of my question. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I am a politician; I'm not clairvoyant. But first of all, we see already that technology does not only take away jobs, but it creates it as well. I gave you a few examples, how I think that actually handicapped people, people with high -- high home-work burden, like women with small children, they actually are much freer to act in the new technology world actively on the job market. </p><p>      So good things are happening, and they're happening also to people with limited education and skills. For example, channeling YouTube may make quite good money, and it doesn't take a degree at all.</p><p>      So new jobs are coming. I don't know where, but the important thing is that we should actually support this change, not try to hold it back. I'm quite sure that in 15 years' time, in industry, all the things we need will be made with the same proportional workforce, which is currently in agriculture, 3 to 4 percent of all workforce, not more. The rest will work elsewhere, and they will do something online. What exactly, who knows? </p><p>      Some things we can see already, but I'm sure there will be much more new stuff emerging, which we cannot imagine right now. At least, I cannot. I have a, well, not very good imagination.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Madam President, thank you very much. Just a phenomenal discussion. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2021700329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1W-2WC1-JBHT-D44P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 5, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00029P0</classCode><className>BAKER &amp;

Thank you for joining us today. I'm David Lashway, and I lead Baker McKenzie's cyber-security global practice. Delighted to have you all with us today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      Good morning, Madam President. Thank you for joining us. Damon Wilson and the folks from the Atlantic Council, thank you for hosting today with us. Jim Schiutto from CNN is here, as well, and will be carrying the day in the discussions later this morning. So thank you all.</p><p>      Distinguished guests -- Mr. Chertoff, thank you for being here. It's good to see you and some old friends, Chris Boehner (ph) and others from the State Department. Thank you for joining us today.</p><p>      Yesterday, Madam President, while at the White House, you reminded us of the blue, black and white of your flag and that you will always remember that it flew in -- here in America when it could not fly in Estonia, during 50 years of the 100 years that we celebrate during your visit today, due to occupation.</p><p>      You reminded us, as well, of our partnership to confront challenges, and that that partnership is based upon three common things:  one, an understanding; two, the rule of law; and three, and perhaps most importantly, common beliefs. You said that we form the axis of the good based upon these.</p><p>      We are proud to fly the blue, black and white of your flag here today, and we welcome you to the discussion to advance our common beliefs and understanding around cyber-security and other security risks, both in Estonia, in Europe more generally and here in the United States. </p><p>      Marie Under, perhaps the most notable 20th-century Estonian poet, who lived during Soviet occupation and wrote of her experience, in her famous poem, \"Night,\" wrote, \"And, hand in hand, we walk uphill together.\" </p><p>      I hope that, through the discussion today, we will go hand in hand through this discussion and through what will confront us in cyber in the days ahead.</p><p>      And, finally, as we were just discussing this morning and as you mentioned yesterday, you reminded us Americans to reflect on the words that are carved in the granite monuments around our mall. That caused me to pause this morning and think for a moment of all the different statements that are carved across the mall that we look out on today. </p><p>      And, on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death, no statement came to mind more than this -- perhaps one of the great American poets in Mr. King:  \"If we are to have peace on Earth,\" he said, \"our loyalties must transcend our race, our tribe, our class and our nation, and this makes us better. And, in common, we must develop a world perspective.\"</p><p>      Thank you for sharing your perspective today. Thank you for joining us, and we look forward to the discussion.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      PAVEL:  Good morning, and welcome, everyone. I'm Barry Pavel. I'm a senior vice president at the Atlantic Council, and I direct the Scowcroft Center on -- on Strategy and Security there. </p><p>      On behalf of the council, I'm really honored to -- to welcome you to our conversation with -- with President Kaljulaid of the Republic of Estonia, especially since this is her first public event here in Washington, D.C. And, Madam President, thank you so much for being -- for being here with us. </p><p>      Again, I'd also like to welcome those of you who are following the webcast online. Please feel free to join the conversation on Twitter, using the hashtag #USBalticSummit, and the account @cyberstatecraft.</p><p>      In today's discussion, we'll be touching on issues that -- that, in my view, will be key to the decade unfolding ahead of us, and those issues include artificial intelligence, blockchain and cyber-security, all matters on which President Kaljulaid has a strong voice and leadership, particularly given her presidency of a country undertaking what the New Yorker has called \"the most ambitious project in technological statecraft today.\"</p><p>      PAVEL:  Estonia has been at the cutting edge of the digital revolution since well before most of us were actually calling it a revolution.</p><p>      By the late 1990s, all of Estonia's schools were online. And since then, it's gone digital on all its government services and set up data embassies outside the country to safeguard that information.</p><p>      That's the kind of cyber foresight that we could use more of. And that's why we're so proud to have President Kaljulaid with us today.</p><p>      At the Atlantic Council, we've redoubled our efforts toward fostering an international community of like-minded states and reinvigorating an adaptive set of global norms and rules built on common principles such as openness, transparency and the rule of law. Sometimes we do that the old-fashioned way through diplomacy and summits, but we're also passionate about innovating wherever useful and needed.</p><p>Estonia's project of digital statecraft, or e-Estonia, perfectly mirrors that spirit of much-needed innovation. By leveraging technology to transform everything from voting to citizenship, Estonia has shown us how to bring these tried and tested values forward into this century.</p><p>      But of course introducing a digital -- digital element to governance also introduces risks, as Estonia itself knows very well from the cyber attacks of 2007. The very freedom and connectivity that makes our societies what they are, also opens us to malicious activities undertaken by those who oppose our values, as Lieutenant General McMaster outlined so passionately and eloquently before some of us at the Atlantic Council last evening in his final public remarks as national security advisor.</p><p>Estonia used the -- Estonia used the 2007 attack to turn its vulnerabilities into strengths, and it's now widely considered a global leader on cyber-security, with Tallinn hosting the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence.</p><p>      But it underscores the need for us to devote real resources to protecting our increasingly information-based societies. And though we are already doing much to safeguard ourselves, as General McMaster said, much more work remains to be done on all fronts and in very close coordination with our allies.</p><p>      And that's why at the Scowcroft Center we devote so many sustained efforts to strengthening cyber statecraft, working closely with key allies in every region of the world. And that's why we organize teams to visit the Baltics -- as we are doing next week, for example -- to engage more directly with our allies, to help shore up deterrence, defense and resilience against the foremost security challenges that we face.</p><p>      And with that, let me introduce President Kaljulaid and our moderator, Jim Sciutto, to -- to speak to both the promise and peril of digital statecraft.</p><p>      Before becoming the president of Estonia in 2016, President Kaljulaid served as a member of the European Court of Auditors from 2004 to 2016, where she organized the financial audit of E.U. R&amp;D funds, among many other leading responsibilities. She also was the economic adviser to the prime minister from 1999 to 2002, as well as CFO and CEO of the IRU power plant.</p><p>      Leading our discussion today will be Jim Sciutto, chief national security correspondent of CNN; most importantly, a Villanova fan, for those of us from that area.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      With his extensive experience reporting overseas across Asia, Europe and the Middle East, we couldn't have asked for a better guide for this conversation.</p><p>      He was the only American journalist to embed with U.S. special forces during the Iraq invasion, and he has reported undercover from inside Myanmar, and he reported Iran's first reaction to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union remarks.</p><p>      Before we turn to Jim and Kaljulaid, I wanted to thank Baker &amp; McKenzie for hosting us today.</p><p>      Thanks very much.</p><p>      Thanks David Lashway, partner here at the firm, also for his continuous support of our cyber efforts at the Atlantic Council.</p><p>      And now let's get to the good stuff. Thanks again. And I'll hand it over to our esteemed panelists.</p><p>      Thank you very much.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Thank you for the kind introduction. Thanks so much to the Atlantic Council, Baker &amp; McKenzie, and -- and thank you, President Kaljulaid, for allowing me to sit across from you and throw a few questions your way.</p><p>      I've had -- I've had the good fortune of spending some time in Estonia and interacting with -- with Estonian officials, interviewed foreign minister, as I've covered the Russian story and had some nice visits there as well. And I feel lucky for that. In fact, I spent my birthday last year in Estonia.</p><p>      And as you know, it just -- it's a remarkable position, I think, in what has become a dominant national security line for the U.S., as a neighbor to Russia, as one of the first victims of a coordinated Russia cyber attack in 2007; really unprecedented but -- but foreshadowing of things to come.</p><p>      And yet as a country, doubling down, all-in on the digitized society without hesitation and -- and with full confidence. And finding their (ph) way forward. Certainly a lot of lessons to be learned there, I think for -- for Europe for the U.S.</p><p>      The subject today, of course, artificial intelligence, et cetera.</p><p>      I do want to start, if I can, just in light of your visit here and your time yesterday in the White House, I'm curious, do you have confidence that the U.S. is a solid partner for you as you face challenges from Russia, particular cyber challenges from Russia?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes, I have to say I have great confidence in this administration and in American people. And as I also said yesterday, this confidence is not (inaudible). It has (inaudible) in this common, shared values (ph) which we all have. And (inaudible) that, and I think it's pretty obvious that we can have confidence.</p><p>      And I have to say that we've had really good cooperation with his administration (ph) since he took office. (Inaudible). Also (inaudible) -- for example, on nuclear weapons in 21st century, (inaudible) U.N. Security Council (ph) (inaudible) et cetera. So the contents are close and (inaudible). And this gives us confidence (inaudible). And it doesn't (inaudible).</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  If I could start on -- I want to get to artificial intelligence very quickly, but just on cyber, to describe to folks -- one thing that struck me when I was in Estonia is just the frequency of cyber attacks. This is -- this is a daily event, many times a day. These are the numbers of the way it works, right? It doesn't come in -- you know, in pairs or in dozens, it comes constantly.</p><p>      How is it today? And -- and -- and where are the attacks coming from? How aggressive are they? And how do you push back?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  (Inaudible) just because you can't see this in the United States (inaudible). (Inaudible) you also have systems where (inaudible) and analyzed (inaudible) we also learned (inaudible) quite a number of them came from Russia (inaudible) Estonia. And this is how it is.</p><p>      In most of the cases you don't allow it (ph). You just deter and (inaudible) but we don't analyze where it comes from, because they are (inaudible).</p><p>      But (inaudible) or in case you see that someone is coming out (ph) (inaudible) systems, they're not (ph) (inaudible) analyze also where they came from.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  But in most of the cases, it simply doesn't give (inaudible) to deem this piece, because (inaudible) anyway and if it will not have a particular reason to -- to try to (inaudible). Then it just doesn't cooperate. It's just how cyber works, and I don't that it will ever change. This is how it is while...</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  The outgoing national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, said last night that -- and he's not alone in this. You've heard this from many members of the administration, but also from folks outside -- that the U.S. and the West have not yet imposed sufficient costs on Russia to deter activity -- and not just cyber activity, other activity -- in Ukraine, et cetera. Do you agree with that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I think there is considerable space to improve. What has (inaudible) and which has come to many peoples' mind is to go off of the Russian money (ph) that don't perceive to go out to something which were very good. Most of the (inaudible) happened that the discussion was whether or not to throw Russia out of the international money transfer (inaudible), another option, for example, but I think actions need to be proportionate, and meanwhile it's also wise to say that we've been talking as well.</p><p>      Talking all of this (inaudible) and understand this one is going to get as well (ph). (inaudible), this comes from only one source. This is the unit (ph), and we know that. We see it. We observe it very often that, for example, when there are attempts to break off from, let's say, all sanctions on Ukraine, then there is quite clever Russian persons assigned to understand where these attacks are going and trying to use this (inaudible) immediately.</p><p>      And I would even say that quite often Russia goes where it thinks that this total (ph) result may be neglecting this part of Europe or region. I think this happened in Georgia. I think this happened in Ukraine. These countries were trying and -- were trying to come closer to Europe for some time, and obviously Europe (inaudible) to provide (inaudible) and clear opportunity and possibilities on how to come (inaudible) members (ph). So we saw that things went wrong.</p><p>      And actually at the same line, in my mind (inaudible). Maybe there was an understanding that Euro-solidarity is broken because of Brexit. Now, (inaudible), and this is, of course, where we are as well.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  In the case -- in cases like this, where you have comprehensive and quite damaging cyber attacks, in your view, does Article V apply?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I'm quite sure that also if you read the academic analysis of what cyber might cause and that it can have as devastating consequences to a nation's security as conventional attacks, then I'm quite sure that we can imagine situations where Article V would apply. But until you have tested, you'll never know.</p><p>      On the other hand, you don't want to bring the threshold of calling Article V low, so it will always be a difficult question on how to move forward.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  But that is the Russian strategy, is it not, to pursue activities and attacks that are just below the perceived threshold of a coordinated response?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes, but when it becomes dangerous to a country's security and sovereignty, then you know that you have to go and say, \"This is an Article V situation.\"</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Now, did you consider that in 2007? Because this was quite -- I mean, this was an attack designed to cut Estonia off, right, in effect?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First of all, 2007 attack was in no way dangerous to Estonia's security, because what Estonia was able to do in 2007, it walled off the country. Inside the country, services was running, so Estonia was not down. What was down was the external connection to Estonia.</p><p>      I was in Luxembourg. I couldn't access my bank account, but all Estonians in Estonia could and the services were up and running. So it definitely was not an attack which could -- which could have actually been a risk to this country's security.</p><p>      In addition, it wasn't -- it wasn't very effective in -- in attacking the vital systems of the country. Digital government systems, yes. But I mean, nobody dies if they are down for two hours. They were mostly functional and they were just walled off from the rest of the internet world.</p><p>      The simple denial of the service attack, which nowadays is very common. So definitely, that would not have been an Article V case.</p><p>      But if you think of the whole 2007 situation, with Russia provoking also -- also while people were fighting on the streets for a couple of nights, et cetera, so you had -- you had a more dire situation than just a cyber attack and you had to see all of these facts together. That was a cyber attack combined with what else was going on in the country, and that is why the European partners and allies also came out in strong support of Estonia, calling out that this is Russian.</p><p>      And this is very important that this call came; that nobody then asked (inaudible) questions, et cetera, probably because they couldn't yet. I mean, this was not the common thinking then. Everybody was in shock and awe that cyber attack against a nation can exist at all.</p><p>      But nevertheless, the support was -- was -- as we see it today when something like this happens.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There was a good piece last week, I believe it was by Max Boot, who made the argument that the U.S. and NATO is, in effect, fighting the last war again; making that mistake of fighting the last war. That in this environment of hybrid warfare like you experienced in 2007 and see elsewhere today, that it's not about buying more littoral combat ships, right? That you need to focus on the right tools, whether they be offensive cyber weapons, et cetera.</p><p>      Do you have a concern that that's the case; that folks are looking backwards as opposed to forwards? Especially with Estonia that -- that by its very nature looks forward in terms of technology?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes. But first of all, just because you have newer kinds of risks doesn't make the old kind of risks disappear, unfortunately.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  (inaudible).</p><p>      KALJULAID:  If it were that, I would be extremely happy and maybe even welcome these new risks which are geographic (ph) in nature, because then, of course, our geopolitical seismic (ph) region will not be anymore geopolitically seismic (ph) because globally we are.</p><p>      And it's only partly a joke, but if you think seriously where Russia is ahead of us -- we know that NATO is stronger than Russia. But if you look at, let's say, eastern border of NATO and conventional capacities, then Russia has considerable might there.</p><p>      If you now think that you are -- you are seeing what is happening to our country's economy and technological development, because while Russia is very proud about Ukrainian sanctions and its own counter-sanctions by which Russia doesn't buy agriculture products anymore from European market, that it is now an independent -- well, independently able to feed its own population, then this is wonderful. You are primary sector exports (ph) and you are great agrarian country, 21st century.</p><p>      Something's missing. Technology's missing.</p><p>Russia is losing out on technology development because of our sanctions big time. I'm quite sure that if Georgia never happened, Russia would be part of the Horizon 2020 European R&amp;D program, because Georgia, for example, is participating in that program.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  So they must see that they're losing in their might. I mean, it's not so big country, it's not economically well off, and its prognosis is bad, so -- and you still have some conventional advantages somewhere, globally.</p><p>      I think this is particularly the time when you need to be vigilant in your analysis and in your response to be able to deter, if there were to be a sudden attempt to try to turn the tables. </p><p>      Therefore, we cannot neglect conventional risks, even if there are new risks. And I think it's more true today than, maybe, it was, I'd say, 10 years ago.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  You raise a point, which is something of a contrarian point of view here in the U.S., that -- that the perception that Russia is winning is misplaced; that, in fact, they're paying a very high cost in economic terms, technological terms.</p><p>      You know, if you -- if you -- you know, to echo, to some degree, as you did, Senator John McCain, Russia's a gas station, right? You know, the -- the -- you know, it's still basically a petrol economy. Not great to -- to travel...</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  What's that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Producing very good yogurt (ph), as well, nowadays, which is fine.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      You have to give a country credit it deserves.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Big picture, do you -- are you making an argument that Russia's losing strategically?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes. Strategically, Russia is losing. And, therefore, I think we need to take this very seriously -- what their analysis of the situation might be. </p><p>      What -- when will the window of opportunity of turning the tables suddenly on us close? We don't know this. We don't know what's the analysis, and we don't know, also, on a technical level, when is the moment.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Turning the tables meaning a catastrophic attack meant to...</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Something going really wrong, yes. In conventional sphere, in somewhere else -- something like Salisbury -- I mean, we didn't -- if somebody had told you two months ago that this would happen, would you have thought it's probable? No. So I think we need to be very vigilant right now.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Do you -- do you envision that -- again, I'm asking you to predict, which I know that no politician likes to do. But -- but are you speaking in the cyber sphere? Are you speaking in the kinetic sphere, or -- could be a whole range?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I'm speaking in cyber sphere. And I think, Russia aside, we need to think much more seriously how we treat, internationally, the risks stemming from -- from the cyber, and also from the fact that we have more and more self-learning systems.</p><p>      And, also, I think we should think about -- that maybe Elon Musk and (inaudible) and others -- that they're right about A.I. And they put the probability of having A.I. at 50 percent at 2050. Well, I take this with -- pinch of salt, because I have a degree in genetic engineering.</p><p>      And, when I was starting in university in '90s, then, everybody was sure that we would clone people by 2010. And we are very, very far from that. So I don't know whether we should take it seriously. But at least I know this:  that we can create systems which are self-learning and pretty autonomous, looking like A.I. to most people. </p><p>      So we should actually understand what new kinds of risks stem from that. And I particularly love the -- the example of an -- of an -- close-to-A.I. or even A.I. war -- means (ph) somebody's nuclear system -- doesn't matter whose -- it -- this could be the system of an axis of good or an axis of bad. Doesn't matter, really. </p><p>      But imagine you have a war, and it's in somebody's system, and it's self-learning, and we sent it into the system thinking that we know what it will find as equipment (ph) -- the software in that system -- and then it finds something unexpected. For example, somebody has taken a contaminated computer to the system -- very common thing. Somebody read (ph) internet on the same computer, then connected it to some technical system.</p><p>      And this, our A.I. little war now (ph), reads this information. And this changes our understanding, because we thought it will only read and learn about the system, but he (ph) read a piece of news. And this piece of news said that United Nations getting ready to ban A.I. for military use.</p><p>      And this system is in the nuclear element, and it knows it is A.I., and it knows the system where it is is military. What will happen? And it's not as science fiction as -- as it sounds. Maybe this particular example still is, but I use it to explain that, I mean, we have loads of things which might come not necessarily from state and government actors. </p><p>      Artificial intelligence, as far as we see now, will not be created by a public actor. It will created, probably, by somebody else. Where? We don't know. When? We don't know. We know it hasn't been created, because, according to the current technology development, it would eat so much energy that we would notice that somewhere, globally, energy is being used to this extent.</p><p>      But it might happen. And we are not even discussing about how international law should apply, what should be our measures, counter-measures. </p><p>      For example, we could agree, at the United Nations level, that, if we detect that energy somehow being used in a concentrated way somewhere, or that somebody has built a neural-network-like computer network somewhere, this would trigger an inspection. </p><p>      Are we discussing it? No. We are only discussing the cyber, conventional, and failing even there to agree how exactly international law should apply in cyber sphere.</p><p>      I think we are so far behind the curve of where we should be. And I think this is now urgent discussion which you should be having. But you don't have many takers, I have to say.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There's a great quote, and I don't -- I can't quote it from memory, that -- that Putin said at a conference last year about -- the country that controls A.I. will dominate in a number of ways. And then I often read that quote at speeches, and ask folks who they think said it. And they always say, \"Elon Musk,\" or something like that.</p><p>      It's Putin. He's clearly thinking in these terms. Whose -- who, to our knowledge, is ahead on A.I.? China? Russia? The U.S.? Estonia?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  My guess is that it's in private sector, not in government sector right now. But, indeed, what -- I noticed this quote, and I was very worried. </p><p>      Because, normally, President Putin speaks -- he -- in his -- if we look back in retrospective -- I mean, all the discussion about geopolitical catastrophe of breaking down the Soviet Union, thereafter came tries to negotiate, then -- Georgia, et cetera -- sometimes you hear something -- well, we've heard very often, for example, that the Baltic states are very stupid to leave the Russian electricity grid, because, of course, it's very technically stable.</p><p>      And the -- which is true, by the way. It is technically very stable. Yet, we know that he spent a lot of money to make sure that his structures will not suffer if we are pushed off the grid suddenly. Right now, this is not still possible, but it is (ph).</p><p>      So this makes us to -- work with European Commission to make sure that we could be deconnected (ph) from -- from that grid as quickly as possible and connected to the European electricity grid even if, I mean, economically, it doesn't -- well -- make much sense to do this. But it's clear that, if you hear these things, you need to think about what that might mean. </p><p>      Similarly, there was a call for respect, and then Salisbury. So, indeed, we need to pay attention that artificial intelligence, if it happens in -- somewhere, then we need to detect it quickly. We need to detect it quickly, especially in case it will be in the -- on the axis of bad, not on the axis of good. But my guess is it will be private sector.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  So now I'm going to ask you to predict again. You said that folks, you know, years ago, predicted we'd already be cloning dogs and cats and human beings, and we're not there yet. How many years or decades off do you think the breakthrough is?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I cannot -- I'm not a specialist in that field. But, looking at -- again, at this benchmark of genetic engineering, then we cannot -- well, we can make bacteria with some characteristics which we wanted it to have; that's all. And we are eight years past the date we were supposed to clone human beings, so it might take time.</p><p>      But this doesn't change the fact that -- I mean, autonomous systems, self-learning autonomous systems can mimic pretty closely something which is A.I. It will not be a -- a science fiction, but it -- it may be nevertheless as dangerous, or almost as dangerous. It's just that it's easier to predict what it thinks -- well, \"thinks\" in quotation marks of course.</p><p>      But this example what I came about the war (ph) in nuclear system, this doesn't need to be A.I. It could be actually a -- a well-learning automated system just happening on the wrong piece of information.</p><p>      My example was understandable for us, but we are talking machines there. There might be other technical data which is not understandable for us right now here, which will actually push it off the course, and we need to be ready for these kind of developments.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  And -- and self-learning systems like that exist today?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes, we have self-learning systems playing really good board games, we know that.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  For a digitized economy like Estonia, which has created, of course, many jobs and opportunities for its population, but of course technology, as we know, often replaces human jobs with -- with machines, et cetera.</p><p>      Is -- is the approach of A.I. and -- and the existence of self learning something, you know, a rough equivalence today. What did that do to the future of work?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I think will do good to the future of work. First of all, already now we can see that the current mediocre level of technology was what the humankind is able to achieve is changing the work -- work already.</p><p>      I mean, the fact that I can work from Tallinn for somebody in America, or in France or in Australia demonstrated people don't need enterprises anymore to get the best added value of their skills. They don't need broad skills; they can be extremely narrow skills, and -- and they could sell them globally because you can sell them online, which poses a huge question -- who will get the taxes? And without taxes, we will not -- we will not be able to help our people to pass this transfer.</p><p>      Sometimes people think that the nature of the job will change only for well learned and educated people, but I think it is a great equalizing fact (ph), because you can -- you can actually be somebody who would (inaudible) something very classic, like handicraft, but you will be able to sell it globally.</p><p>      We have in Estonia this -- this case where is (ph) a South African man living in a small county in middle of nowhere basically in Estonia, and he makes bows and arrows. They're really good, I've -- I've understood, because they sell globally for a high price. And -- but he just prefers to live where, I mean, his clients -- the closest client I think was more than 2,000 kilometers away.</p><p>      So, an example, and even for handicapped people, let's imagine you have an -- well an autistic person who is ready to knit socks, but only red ones, probably in his vicinity he wouldn't find enough takers, and since he's incapable to socialize, he cannot sell. But online and globally probably he finds enough, I mean, these people who love just these red socks. So you can sell and -- and you can have a job. And previously, such a person would have been unemployed.</p><p>      So there are numerous ways of how they -- well the work is changing. And what I hate most is that let's tax robots and pay subsistence fees to people. And it always takes me back to the change from agricultural economies to industrial. What if we had taxed tractors and paid subsistence fees to agricultural workers who lost their jobs? Would they have taken up industrial jobs? They wouldn't. And I admit that this transfer was extremely painful, but it was painful because we didn't have social systems and dedication.</p><p>      So now our difficult equation is actually how to keep our social systems and dedication going when the traditional tax system is obviously going with traditional work system. We gathering every morning into an enterprise and working for (ph) the same enterprise, having home address and demanding services in one country globally. This is all going, and we've got to start talking about it right now.</p><p>      And my understanding is that in future, our country will be hub for people, a (inaudible) kind of. I've (inaudible) Estonia, but it provides me (ph) social and educational services, my children online tutoring in Estonia language wherever they are globally, but it doesn't necessitate me to have a postal address in Estonia or something. It's a deal between me and this country.</p><p>      And the problem of course is that if we are lazy in this thinking, then either we lose these services or they will all get privatized, which will actually lower their inclusivity, which might not be a problem for you here in America, but definitely for us in Europe, because our people expect us to provide a kind of school system, health system, health care system, which is available to almost (ph) everybody. So we are much more afraid of -- of these kind of developments, that (inaudible) tax base. But if we are rigid and say to people that unless you do it the old-fashioned way, we don't provide you with services, then they will opt out and go private, or simply go without, and then try to opt in, because only pension system penalizes late opt in. Health-care system does not penalize late opt in in any way; educational system for our children either.</p><p>      I mean, we need to figure it out, because otherwise we will lose the best proportion of earnings tax wise from the younger population.</p><p>      And if you look globally, U.K., Netherlands, Estonia, the number of independently working people is already radically grown, so I'm not talking about tomorrow; I'm talking today. And we need to really think about globally and internationally what to do about it.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  This is happening as we have -- we have a crisis of confidence in a whole host of institutions here in the U.S. I'm a member of the fake news media. You heard the president standing next to you make a reference to fake news yesterday.</p><p>      But it's affecting our technology companies as well. I mean, Facebook's position in the -- in the wake of Russian interference in the election. How much of a challenge is that? Do you see any similar loss of confidence or fear of big tech in Estonia, and if not, how -- how have you avoided that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  We feared Facebook as everybody else, of course. It's pretty obvious, but the difference is we have alternatives to Facebook. We have secure internet communication channels as well.</p><p>      And I've ran around the globe for a year and a half telling everybody that this is unfair that governments have left people and businesses in internet without governmental support, because in the real world or (inaudible) world, you don't imagine that you cannot identify the other person with whom you are talking or interacting or contracting, at least at that point -- at least you would ask for a passport. You don't board a plane without knowing that everybody has dutifully shown up their passports. So we know with whom we are flying all the time.</p><p>      For some reason, governments have failed to notice that their people and their businesses are in internet, and it's a big part of every transaction and quite a lot of communication change is online.</p><p>      And I think governments have exactly the same obligation in the digital sphere to provide people with identification. Estonians have had this way of establishing safe corridors in internet to communicate, because using your digital identity also will create an encrypted channel. So it is failsafe, and, second, you know with whom you're talking. And this kind of internet connection is not dangerous, so our people are not afraid of using -- of using digital signatures, but of course, they also worried about somebody taking their data on Facebook.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  And also we can differentiate. We know this. It's -- it's weird, but, well, I know people have fun with -- with these kind of things. For example, one of my friends heard this. Somebody told that, in Estonia, there exists a -- well, an ear (ph) doctor, and his name is -- is Dr. Ear (ph). So he -- she wanted to check whether this is really true, and she Googled, and, for two months, she afterwards got all kinds of ear remedies, hearing devices, these kind of advertisements.</p><p>      So people automatically assume that this is OK for kind of consumer services. But, for some reason, they didn't realize that, if this is going on, then, of course, this is going on also for political debate. </p><p>      And our people, since they can differentiate between safe and unsafe internet a little bit better -- because we have safe one, as well, and we are not forced to use the unsafe one if we don't want to -- then I think they are a bit more resilient than people elsewhere. </p><p>      Yet they are afraid, of course, and they simply don't use Facebook, in that case, of course, if they are afraid. Nobody would, anyway, contract over (ph) Facebook. I don't know. That would be weird, so.</p><p>      Also, I've noticed that, in Estonia, people pay for internet time. If they have transacted and signed a contract, then you don't use a credit card for payment, but you use safe channel. You go to a bank, log in online and make an online payment. It doesn't take much longer, but is much safer. People prefer this and consider this safer than using credit cards online.</p><p>      But they do it because it's as comfortable. If it were more comfortable, or not possible, comfortably, to pay -- you'd need to walk to bank office, for example -- then, they would use credit cards. So it has to be. </p><p>      The -- the good internet has to be comfortable and available, and it starts from identification. I cannot repeat this often enough. It's our obligation as -- as governments to realize people have to have safe identification means in the internet sphere, as they have in real life.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  You have the advantage of having a genetic engineering degree, so -- very aware of -- of the health implications of a highly digitized society, particularly as it relates to privacy. </p><p>      In light of what you were just discussing, social media, et cetera, how do you -- how do you handle those? Because, of course, no one is more concerned about their privacy than when it comes to -- to health information.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I think all Estonian politicians always ask this question from all audiences:  Do you know who read your doctor's notes last? Was it your doctor, or somebody you don't know? When we in Estonia -- if somebody reads our -- I don't know, tax declaration, health information -- you know.</p><p>      But, I mean, sometimes people think that Estonia is -- is a kind of wild world of -- world of internet. It isn't. It's actually a much stronger regulated world of internet. Our government has given people numerous guarantees that they will know if somebody's -- looks around in their data. </p><p>      We also gather genetic information of all our people. It's another legally permissive environment -- result of Estonian way of having a state. We -- we know much more of our -- our people's, well, genetic data -- common markers for common ailments (ph). </p><p>      And we are enlarging this project, and -- and people are not afraid to participate, because state has given guarantees about how this data is to be handled. Even your doctor wouldn't see it if you don't want it. But then, probably, you don't want, first, to have this, and this is, of course, voluntary, whether you do or you don't.</p><p>      So we have Estonian Genome Foundation, created at the same time as, more or less -- as the digital Estonia, and it's very similar in -- in what we did in digital. We probably have done other things, but they have not flied (ph). This flied (ph). </p><p>      It flied (ph) for short term, from 2000 to 2003, because, you know, we created this environment where population and genetics was legal, and it wasn't in most countries, globally. It was in Iceland. Iceland was our only competitor, but, luckily, they have even tinier population. So, to do population genetics in a population of 300,000 is -- is more of a joke than doing it in 1.3 million, which is still a joke, but something.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      So private companies flocked in and paid for founding Estonia Genome Foundation. It was done on investment banking finance only. But then what happened? The governments came in. The other governments, entering (ph) the market, because they, of course, started to buy all these services, because, of course, companies were clever enough to say that you have to pay. It's not enough to create legal space.</p><p>      And then, for 10 years, it was dormant until the technology became so cheap that, now, we can continue with -- with helping our people to understand the genetic risks of having heart attack, or diabetes II and other of these common ailments.</p><p>      But, again, very often, people ask, then, that \"Are you afraid of\" -- and we say no, because we know that this data is protected. The state knows how to protect data. And -- and it's in -- it's still in my ownership. </p><p>      I mean, yes, it is in some kind of a database, but I own it. It's not state's. It's mine, and I decide who uses it, and how. Personally, I don't mind if you know that my diabetes II risk is higher, and it is. But that's fine with me, so I can tell it openly.</p><p>      And I think it's important we work on these areas, as well, because 90 percent of the world's population, when they feel sick, what do they do first? Google. Nowadays, what you have on Google is mostly rubbish medical information. </p><p>      But you need to have solid alternatives for people. So medical doctors need to have access to people's data -- of course, without names and everything, so -- to analyze and create self-learning medical doctors who are able to respond to people.</p><p>      NHS in Great Britain is experimenting, actually, that, if people call in the emergency line, and it's established that, in fact, it's not an emergency, then they are trying, with -- with a robot, to try to, well, direct this person to go to pharmacy or to go to doctor or whichever way. </p><p>      But these systems have to have databases to learn. And donating your information to them -- health information or genetic information -- in an anonymous format is a great thing to do for humanity. But it needs to be safe, and it can be safe.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  But -- but how could you -- I guess the issue is, even with regulation, the question becomes confidence, right, and confidence in security, because I'm someone -- and listen, I -- I have such a baseline level of -- of digital knowledge, but -- but I have an assumption -- and this is partly because of the work that I do, but I -- also, I lived in China -- I have assumption that there is no actual privacy, because I've been a victim of -- of three or four -- of the three or four biggest hacks:  the OPM hack, the Anthem Healthcare one, and I forget what the other one -- I've lost track. </p><p>      I have so many free digital ID services paid for by various entities that mishandled my information, I -- I don't even know. So how do you get those two to come together? Because you could have that knowledge, but, without confidence, then, you know...</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First thing first. This is the big problem of developing digital country like Estonia:  Lots of digital services provided online, indeed, with identification ways -- I don't know. You use some username and some code, and then you write it on your computer, have a special file in your computer, et cetera. It's unsafe, terribly unsafe.</p><p>      Or take a very -- it's a concrete example. I got it from Rudy Giuliani -- or I put the example together, but I learned from him. E-prescription's pretty popular in United States, but it's an e-mail. I'm sorry. </p><p>      And, when something goes wrong with this e-mail, e-prescription, then confidence in all e-prescriptions is down the drain, including ours. But our e-prescription system is much safer. You -- you can never say it's absolutely safe, but it's definitely safer than paper analogs (ph), so I'm quite sure I call it safe. </p><p>      But, when something goes wrong in one service, people lose trust in others. And that is where we need to go up (ph) the confidence and trust of all our people, constantly explaining to our people where we differ.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  We are not, I mean, holding this to (ph) ourselves. Actually, we very much like to expand our -- our X-Road, what we call, which is our identification system.</p><p>Finland is using the same, and we can change real -- real-time data with them. We don't, because we haven't sold it legally, but, technically, we already can, if -- for example.</p><p>      So we are open to others to use ours or similar systems. We are not telling that you cannot do it. But, if you come with us into this world, you have to take responsibility to -- explaining to your people how these services work. </p><p>      And, in addition, you have to promise that you make some promises to your people about how -- and then you have to apply this in your law base (ph) -- how you use this data, how you protect this data, what is your obligation vis-a-vis your people in case you have this data.</p><p>      For example, I would absolutely refuse to distribute our X-Road's technology to a company for -- which I knew that it has, let's say, only one single database where it tends to gather all the information about its citizens, et cetera.</p><p>      But, I mean, if you do it in a smart -- smart and sharp way, and protect this, also, legally, what you are doing, and protect your people, it can be done, not only in Estonia, but all that's following (ph). Denmark is quite good example, Luxembourg is quite good example. We are small, but it's something.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Before -- I do want to go to the audience soon -- I do want to ask you about blockchain, because I know this is at the top of your list of interests.</p><p>      Is the -- and, just out of curiosity, and you know far more than me -- but the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble, or at least the volatility there -- is that a just a bump on the road towards all the potential of blockchain technology?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Well, do we want to talk blockchain or Bitcoin? Let's agree on that first?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  It's an example.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Totally bad example. Let's take, then, Bitcoin.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      And, for Bitcoin, you don't need to be a -- a well -- well-established macroeconomists to understand that money needs economy, and a link to a real economy. Then you know whether you have too much money, too little money, is it overvalued, undervalued -- all this. </p><p>      I ask you, where's the underlying economy of Bitcoin? There isn't. Or, if there is, then we cannot measure it; therefore, we cannot understand what's the value of Bitcoin. This much about Bitcoin -- I mean, this is an illusion. </p><p>      This has an interesting afterthought, if I think more about the Bitcoin situation. A well-known A.I. example says that A.I. is dangerous because it will make the world into paper clips. And then people say, \"No, no. A.I. will not be so stupid as to make the world into paper clips.\"</p><p>      And I've also thought that maybe it wouldn't. But, now, I mean, we are not A.I. We are human beings, and we mine Bitcoin. We spend real-life resources to the detriment of our environment -- lots of energy, et cetera, and other resources -- to mine something which has absolutely no value. So, I mean, where exactly are we better than A.I., here, in this problem?</p><p>      Now, to blockchain, this is different thing. Blockchain is a technology which allows different systems to keep track about what different systems around it, with which it is connected, are doing. And we think this is very useful technology. </p><p>      It's -- it's one step forward from what we have, because our digital signature, for a normal person, would look pretty much like blockchain, because it's signature and it's timestamped. It's similar enough for experts to look for the authors (ph) of Bitcoin in Estonia, but it's not the same technology.</p><p>      So blockchain allows -- for our case, we think it will allow our state to go proactive in offering services. How? Right now, we still have to apply for state digital services, one by one. For example, you have a child. You register the birth, then you apply for social services.</p><p>      But our people are starting to ask this question that -- I mean (ph), \"Government, you promised you would only ask once. Now, you have the information that I have a baby, and we are entitled to a certain payment for this baby.\"</p><p>      It's not relevant how much you earn, we have universal child support in Estonia. \"So why on earth, government, you now force me to apply, even if I can do it online? Why I need to go to some home page and, I mean, ask for this service? You can simply provide it to me. I have a baby. You know my bank account, because it's -- I pay taxes. And you know I'm entitled to this money. So why should I ask?\"</p><p>      And the answer is, because we don't have blockchain. Our systems do not have the capacity to make sure that -- I mean, one system -- what one system is doing -- that something's not going wrong at the same time at -- in the different system. Blockchain will help us to solve this problem.</p><p>      Our pilot is not social -- social security, because this is a high-confidence-level-demanding service. Our pilot there is traffic accident -- simple traffic accident, which happens every day. I mean, two cars get a little bit ruined. It's an insurance case. And we think that we -- by using blockchain, we can solve it in 30 minutes -- all the administrative questions.</p><p>      So you register your traffic accident. We have, of course, online car registry, and all these elements are there -- online insurance, full database of insurance schemes, et cetera. So we could, actually, in 30 minutes, we think, send information to both parts (ph) of the accident, and -- about how this incident was solved. </p><p>      But, for this, we need to have blockchain, which makes us also to think that -- when is the point when we need to create a legal entity for an -- learning -- or a machine learning system, or a machine system? And we feel we are coming quite close to this point. So we are now discussing exactly with -- how to regulate -- how to regulate, well, autonomous systems in our law base.</p><p>      Attribution questions will rise. And then, of course, it will be an interesting question. I think I read it this morning in one Estonian daily (ph) -- it -- lawyers were discussing that, if a robot kills somebody, then how do we know that the robot did not get the order from its owner to kill somebody, but simply went crazy? </p><p>      And, I mean, it's -- it's not -- I mean, it's not a laughing matter. This is the questions we need to solve. And also, for our -- this proactive state, we need to solve this question, and, yet again, we need to solve the question of privacy. </p><p>      People probably need to somehow opt in to this kind of system, understanding and analyzing, themselves, whether they want to use or they don't want to use this. </p><p>      So it's not easy, but we are thinking forward and we are forced to think forward, because, exactly, people are asking, \"You know this. Why do I need to apply at all?\" It's people who want this. </p><p>      And government, once it has undertaken this digital disruption of society, cannot back off. You have to continuously, all the time, first of all, make sure that the existing systems are still safe to use, that you can patch them up if something goes wrong and that you can continue developing.</p><p>      And it is also true that, sometimes, things go wrong. We have at least two means of identification online. Yesterday, for two hours, one of them was down. The other was working. So we need to have alternatives. But the problem with our country is that you cannot have digital with paper alternative. You have to have digital with digital alternative.</p><p>      And -- and we had this problem last year, where there is a chip maker, whom I wouldn't name, but maybe some of you know, which actually called 1 billion chips off the market, said that they aren't safe to use. </p><p>      Most of these were door cards (ph). High number was actually ID cards, but mostly in the countries which -- where people have IDs, but don't use them. So they could be simply, well, shut down for a while.</p><p>      We couldn't do it. For us, it was right that (ph) the service continues, because our people refused it otherwise. They wouldn't go to offices to queue for services. </p><p>      KALJULAID:  They even got really angry that -- because some of them finally -- most of them could solve the problem online, but some couldn't. And they had to go to a police or border guard office. And then, we got loads of complaints that -- oh, kidding (ph), I had to queue for an hour. And I mean, and then you explain to people that people in Western Europe normally take a day off to register their car.</p><p>      So this is where you have your population, and this also demonstrates to you that whatever Estonian government wants you to do -- go completely back to paper-based system for example -- it simply cannot. Disruption has happened, and now you have to live with the consequences and work forward to make sure that you are actually -- well, continuing to provide services to your people, to their satisfaction.</p><p>      Which means that even we are on the Mars already, our people want us to be even further. I mean so, Earth for them is not the solution.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  So wait, should we buy up block chain, or -- I wasn't clear. I'm joking.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      I got the answer loud and clear. OK, so we're going to go to the -- to the assembled audience here for questions. I think we have about a half hour. Gentleman in the back with his hand raised? And there are -- yes, there are microphones.</p><p>      Please if you can, identify yourself. And the other guidance I always give is phrase it in a question rather than a statement or a speech.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      QUESTION:  Michael Shraig (ph) with MIT.</p><p>Estonia is a very small country, as you pointed out. China, huge country. United States, huge country. Key to making machine learning work is scale. You're a small -- you're a scientist, you're from a small country, but you deal with giants and behemoths.</p><p>      What's the most important thing you've learned about managing scale in an environment where petabytes and zettabytes is the future of what you're talking about?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First thing to realize is indeed that scale wise, we don't create technology. We use technology quite common in private sector globally, so we don't have to carry the cost, and we fully understand that we don't control the delivery chain of this technology.</p><p>      And this is why we need to make sure we're using, let's say, these digital chips, that we also have mobile I.D., for example, because we simply don't control the technology. But this is what makes it available.</p><p>      If you now look more locally in Estonia, then since we've had absolute inclusivity, this digital chip is part of our I.D. card, with which we travel as well, at least within the European Union. Then this inclusivity from the other side is (inaudible). So for local services actually, companies have it quite good. They have the 1.3 million market at least, immediately at their hand.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Gentleman here?</p><p>      QUESTION:  I thank you for your comments today. Two questions, one -- are (ph) there related. One is recently Estonia joined a number of other countries, including the U.S., in condemning the NotPetya worm and attributing it to Russia.</p><p>      This is always a delicate question when you have this kind of collective response. What -- attribution the other day is a -- is a, you know, political issue. What level of confidence do you need, does Estonia need, to join that kind of collective because it's more powerful?</p><p>      And then on Russia, what kinds of actions would you think would be effective in actually deterring their behavior in cyberspace? You said that we need to do more. McMaster said that last night. What kinds of things would actually work?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  In cyberspace, we need monitoring, and we need to agree that international monitoring is allowed, and that there will be elements and events which will trigger international monitoring, very similarly as you have with (ph) sensitive nuclear technology globally. We need to agree what it is.</p><p>      I give you a few examples. Radical shift in energy consumption in some laboratory or somewhere is one thing. Second is now we understood that we need to create the, like, neural networks to be able to think of A.I. which will not consume so much energy that it will be dead immediately. These could be regulated. This is hardware after all. This could be regulated that you need to allow international monitoring, and this -- well, we need to bring in globally all countries. Because as I said, it's not anymore enough like in the nuclear case, that some countries agree and the rest will simply, well, accept because they don't have the weapons. It's global, and we don't know where it will -- where it will happen. So this much for regulation.</p><p>      For confidence level, it's not quantitative; it's always qualitative analysis, and depends -- well it very much, you have to go case by case.</p><p>      But it's interesting that we're joining (ph), because for us it's a solidarity act, because NotPetya didn't pass in Estonia, only in one international company system, which was not linked to Estonian system. Pure (ph) act of solidarity.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Is there a mic?</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Yeah, it's coming.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Fran Burwell from the Atlantic Council.</p><p>      Two questions. First off, when you are thinking about how to deter or respond to an attack, does it matter if it is a nation-state behind it, or whether it is organized crime, or is it the same response?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Same.</p><p>      QUESTION:  And -- OK. And the other thing is, you raised the issue of taxes. But your approach to tax sounds a little bit different for me from what has been proposed by some E.U. governments, including in terms of taxing digital enterprises, which, as you're well aware, some people here fear is aimed primarily at some large U.S. companies in Europe. Can you be a little bit more specific about where you think taxes should go to counter this -- to deal with this new world?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I can be a little bit more specific. Fully aware that first of all, I am in -- I'm in contradiction with much of the European thinking, plus OSCE (ph) rules, everything. So we absolutely need to modify international space, and we cannot go alone. So we need to first understand that, I mean, we have this problem, and then we need to start seeking solutions. And voluntary declaration of (inaudible) with any chosen state would be actually something, which probably is the -- is the solution to the problem. And I realize I'm -- that we are very far from -- from getting there.</p><p>      Meanwhile, Europe is doing what they always do in these kinds of systems. You apply a patch, and then you see what you can do to solve -- solve the problem as it is. And I think applying patches meanwhile to make sure that society is at least accepting that, I mean, we do need to tax differently, just because internet exists, is -- is a step in right direction. Of course it can be inhibitive to -- to some investment and so on. And I'm not necessarily supporting it, but I see where it comes from politically.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Gentleman standing in the back?</p><p>      QUESTION:  I'm Basil Scarliss (ph). I've been involved in foreign affairs.</p><p>      And I have a question on sanctions. Perhaps a good way to deter Russian cyber attacks and other meddling and military action would be to have a more effective regime for punishing the Russian leader and the oligarchs.</p><p>      And one obstacle is that in the United States, and to some extent in the United Kingdom, we allow shell companies to purchase properties, to make investments in corporations and in other organizations without revealing the beneficial owner; they can hide behind an attorney.</p><p>      The question I have, is do you think it would be much more effective to have targeted sanctions, especially if we could get Congress to pass appropriate legislation?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Simple answer would be yes.</p><p>      Then the political answer would be doesn't concern me, because Estonia doesn't have that much oligarchic money in the country. It's a tiny economy, completely transparent as well, because digital makes it also transparent.</p><p>      And -- and the practical answer is that I think yes, but we must make sure that we remain rule-of-law countries while we do it, as well. This is very important.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  If I could follow on that, this issue comes up -- it came with the response to Skripal attack -- that the next level would have been true financial penalties for people in power.</p><p>      You'll often hear -- whether with Ukraine, U.S. election interference -- about going after Putin's money, whether freezing it or exposing it to -- to his people -- all of his various holdings around the world.</p><p>      Why hasn't that happened yet, in your view?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I simply don't know.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Good answer. </p><p>      There's a group of folks here, but maybe I'll just go from the forward, back. There's a gentleman, and then behind two, and we'll go from there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hans Binnendijk from SAIS. First of all, let me say it's so refreshing to hear a president be able to converse the way you do on these issues. </p><p>      I'd like to ask about Russian attacks using social media. This is below the denial-of-service level. What has been your experience -- not just in Estonia, but in a -- in the Baltic States in general -- with regard to Russian use of social media to try to affect the opinions of your minorities -- Russian-speaking minorities?</p><p>      What have you been able to do about that? I presume you're countering it. And what lessons do you have for us in this area?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First, Baltic states -- well, I cannot say we have seen more of these kind of attacks. I think Germany has had a fair share, and visa case (ph) -- every German knows it. And -- and Emmanuel Macron called Putin out on disrupting the French election processes. </p><p>      We have been expecting and preparing for -- when EFP (ph) was established -- that we will have quite some. Lithuania had one, but the reaction was so quick -- retaliation from Lithuania -- to inform people that this is false news, to make sure that everybody got it -- it was false news -- was so good.</p><p>      But we've actually not seen any further elements. But we are, of course, ready all the time. And the only way to be ready is to tell your people this exists. We talk about troll factories. We show people that they do exist. And, frankly, try to read anonymous internet commentary under some article about -- I don't know, I do it under my articles about myself.</p><p>      I recognize a troll writing quite soon. They are trying to put a message out about you, which comes whichever way -- I mean, it -- it comes. And you have a few -- few kind of names which always will appear. And then you learn to recognize it.</p><p>      And -- and people, having live in -- lived a long time in the internet sphere, learn to understand this. Of course, we all have a big problem that most of the population is not able to differentiate between journalism -- something which pretends to be journalism and -- and something which think it is journalism, because they are -- well, I think those people who don't realize that they are not journalists, but they do -- don't do it in bad will.</p><p>      And, previously, I expected journalists to check their facts when they provide them to me. For some reason, I cannot do it, and I think here is also a frank discussion to be had, because lots of fakes new -- fake news will die if people knew that the safe channels will never pick them up. Yet safe channels stay after they (ph) pick them up.</p><p>      And we need to radically think how to avoid this. First of all, we all need to start paying for our online news, and then we can continue this discussion. I'm sorry it starts with that. Currently, the media sector has no resources to deal with it.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There's a couple questions coming in from Twitters (ph). So, Madam President, this one is, \"We have an obligation to explain the issues around privacy and responsibility to citizens,\" relevant to what you were just discussing. \"How has Estonia brought citizenry to a level where they can understand the explanation?\"</p><p>      And I'm -- I could identify with this, because, I'm sure, like you, you agree to terms that you don't know or read what those terms are, frequently. And so how do you manage that?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  We have only one set of terms, and this is state-guaranteed digital identity. It's not too much to ask people to understand one set of terms and conditions. </p><p>      And the terms and conditions are roughly the same. You keep your identity -- physical one -- separate from the passwords. And, if this, for some reason, was not the case, you run quickly or go online quickly somewhere where you can, well, just close your identity.</p><p>      This is the basic drill. But we have to do it only one copy, because we have the universal system. And that is how we can build trust. And, of course, it is -- government is on the line. </p><p>      It's government which is giving this currently. It's not Google or Amazon or -- or somebody anonymous or not in your country. And I'm sorry -- it wouldn't get better unless more governments take this responsibility.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  (Inaudible) gentleman in the beard, and then -- well, actually, you both have beards. So...</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      ... we'll just have to go to -- left to right.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hey. Matt Leonard with Government Computer News. </p><p>      Can you talk briefly about the data embassy that you guys opened up last summer, what its current role is and any plans for opening up other data embassies, going forward?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  There's not much to talk about. It's a simple thing. Every private enterprise has a safe copy of everything it has, and, if the country's legal base allows it, has it outside of the country.</p><p>      Now, we have a copy of Estonian state, every minute, every moment, in -- in a data embassy. And, since it is state and state data and we need to make sure that our law base about this data and what applies to this data will apply to where it is, we cannot simply establish a server somewhere. </p><p>      We need to have an agreement with Luxembourg, also a very digitally minded and forward-looking country, that we will create a data embassy. So this server park (ph) is a sovereign territory of Estonia, and these servers and this data is -- belong to Estonian state. And, again, there is nothing technologically interesting.</p><p>      Interesting thing is law space, which we two together created, between Luxembourg and Estonia. Whether we need to have more copies -- well, time will tell. But I am quite sure that people would -- would be quite happy to host Estonian data embassy. </p><p>      On the other hand, other states need data embassies too. So -- they all have data which they need to store.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  And just -- I'm curious. Are those updated constantly, then? Because, if my -- my -- if I'm an insurance company, I don't know -- today's data is different from next week's data?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Yes. As I said, all Estonian digital signatures are timestamped. So, in this sense, they are like blockchain, yes.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  And then did you (ph) -- if you still have a question -- the gentleman here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you very much. Grigory (ph) (inaudible) of Russian news agency. So, first question, how -- do you think Estonia needs more NATO (ph) troops to deter Russia? And, if so, how many troops do you need?</p><p>      And the second one is about Skripal poisoning. So Estonia expelled a Russian diplomat, and -- but British experts said yesterday that they don't know a region of the agent that poisoned Skripal and his daughter.</p><p>      So do you -- do you still believe your actions to expel Russian diplomat was justified? And do we (ph) have any evidence of Russian involvement in these poisoning? Or this is just a matter of solidarity with European countries?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  As most countries trace (ph) -- they didn't send out simply diplomats. They sent out diplomats who were acting in a way as diplomats shouldn't act. So there was another reason for -- for this concerted action.</p><p>      What -- what concerns NATO troops, then -- NATO deterrence is -- well, has a history of being 100 percent efficient and effective. NATO has never failed to protect its territory. And it's -- in its entirety.</p><p>      And we trust into this capacity to deter. And we're quite sure that all NATO steps are always adequate to make sure that this deterrence is -- is -- is valued.</p><p>      In the summer, NATO summit will come together and discuss again those issues and these -- those elements. Our role there is to provide honest and open analysis of the security situation, considering conventional risks around our territory and among those -- well, is the information, which we have also talked publicly.</p><p>      Today, the level of conventional capacity surrounding NATO's eastern flank is at the level of 2009 Zapad exercise. We need to draw conclusions from that.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  In the far back here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hi.</p><p>      So, I've read that there are efforts to use blockchain technology in order to -- for example, in the Estonian stock exchange, to make voting easier and more secure and like it -- you know, immutable ledger and all that. You know, it's distributed.</p><p>      There's also efforts in Australia to -- company called My Vote, I think, to utilize the -- you know, relatively secure and distributed immutable ledger to help voting. And I've also heard the idea for voter registries.</p><p>      So I'm just curious, is Estonia considering using blockchain for voter database -- or yeah, voter registry databases, or e-voting -- like direct e-voting itself for candidates, or for referendums at the local level or at the larger level?</p><p>      Because I've heard that. It's an interesting idea and Estonia seems to be a little bit on the cutting edge of using those technologies.</p><p>      So yeah, just blockchain in voting systems basically is the question.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Basically, we have e-voting and this system is tried and tested and free for everybody to try and hack. And voting is the highest confidence level digital service, so you change our voting technology only when you have tried and tested the new technology developments. And you have taught your people that this technology is safe.</p><p>      On lower confidence level of services, voting should be the last which will shift technology, once you already have an established system of secure voting, which we have.</p><p>      So I predict that all other Estonian public services will be blockchain based before our e-voting system will change.</p><p>      And I always tell to other countries, some -- some countries would say, \"Let's start from e-voting.\" And I always say, \"That's a terribly bad idea. Start from school applications or something really -- well, low-worry services. Never start from e-voting.\"</p><p>      You have to teach a population cyber hygiene first. You have to teach them to trust the system. And only then you should apply -- you should try to apply this technology to high-confidence level services like voting.</p><p>      On the other hand, sometimes we get discussion that e-voting must be terribly unsafe. And it comes from people who vote by post, so beats me how this discussion can come up, but it does still come up.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Well, it's a very common fear here, though. I think you would -- I can't imagine a -- and, of course, it's run by states here, but I can't imagine a state legislature who'd push hard for it today, because there is that lack of confidence.</p><p>      Question from Twitter here:  \"Madam President, you speak about the need for government-mandated digital identity. Many people are concerned that this gives too much power to governments. Do you see a need for anonymous transactions? And if so, in what cases?\"</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Well, I'm -- in my character, I'm a simple housewifish politician, and -- and this philosophical question has been bothering me a long time now. Why people in free world trust their banks and Google and Amazon, but don't trust their government?</p><p>      And I don't -- I don't know the answer, but I think we need to have some really good philosophers and social scientists analyzing this question.</p><p>      It's not technology what they are mistrusting. They are not trusting, for some reason, their government. I don't know why.</p><p>      It may be different in every society. There may be similarities. I come from a society where people trust government in this sense. They don't trust it for, I don't know, having -- having a good tax system, or actually our people are very, very critical about our -- our government. It's a national tradition to think we are a badly run country.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      I'm not joking. I mean, in 1943, the chairman of the Bank of England, Lord Wedgwood, he said that Estonia was the best-run country in northern Europe. And then one of our politicians said that the other diplomats told him that, and it's astonishing how little your people appreciate it.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      It's still the same.</p><p>      But they trust government when government provides digital services.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  There's a gentleman here along the aisle, and then we'll go to the back. I think we're getting down to probably the last question or two.</p><p>      QUESTION:  All right, thank you. Johnathan Lynchman (ph) from the Providence Group.</p><p>      You've mentioned a couple of times about educating the public, cyber hygiene. And I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what Estonia does with respect to public education on cyber-security and public information, in terms of making sure that it's both effective and that it reaches everyone.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  Well, teaching hygiene is not as effective as, I don't know, applying some social services. It never will be, because if you think about when we taught people simple hygiene, it was also a lengthy process which gradually reached our people's brains. That you have to wash hands, otherwise you will fall sick; or you have to use toilets, because it's not hygienic to just go to the wood.</p><p>      And it took us time. But I think we have nowadays much better communication means to teach our people cyber hygiene.</p><p>      And the truth is, we have to start from this and many people haven't done it. Technology will not solve it. There will never be a technology which will be able to cover for all human errors. The only way is to tell people that, \"You are responsible.\"</p><p>      And the way to do it is education. I mean, you have to teach people at school about the risks of internet. We have (inaudible) police which goes around the schools and teaches children. And it also teaches them that it's just -- I mean, if it's not nice to be rude toward, well, the other kids in class in real life, it's as rude in internet, et cetera. It starts from this low-level thing.</p><p>      On the other hand, I recognize that most countries are now in bigger difficulty than Estonia, because we started teaching cyber hygiene at the turn of the century. And then the risk was some virus, and you just downloaded Kaspersky or something else. And -- and then it was cleared. Now you have to jump into the internet of things.</p><p>      Yet saying that it's impossible doesn't -- I mean, doesn't solve the problem, so we have to try. And I think it has to go down to (inaudible) and primary education, this cyber hygiene teaching.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Oh, right here in the front. And then we'll go to the back, if that's OK. Sorry, I'm having you...</p><p>      QUESTION:  I can -- I -- I'm pretty loud. I'm Claudia Jona (ph) from the Atlantic Council.</p><p>      What is your take on the -- on the -- (inaudible) deadlock (ph) on the global discussion on cyber norms? What is your take on -- on why the discussion -- where it's where it is right now?</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I'm disappointed that the process in United Nations fell through. And I'm quite sure that we need to revive it.</p><p>Estonia, among other things, have decided to run for United Nations Security Council, and we are in the active phase of campaign. And whether we win or we lose, this is in our talking points about discussing global security.</p><p>      New Zealand took climate to the Security Council. We will take digital to the Security Council. And when we are elected, and we hope we will be, this is (inaudible) platform, definitely, and we need to continue.</p><p>      There was a working group. Marina Coleron (ph) from Estonia was -- was -- was responsible for that work as well, and -- and we were deeply disappointed when this got stalled. But the problem has not gone away.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  In the back, here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Madam President, Franica Jerka (ph), Broadcasting Board of Governors. </p><p>      In this city, there is ongoing discussion how to counter Russian propaganda (inaudible). So my question is, do you believe the blocking of Russian TV channels, like it was made in Ukraine, like it will -- it will be in Moldova, in other countries, is an efficient measure? And the second question, do you think is it a good time for now, especially now, for Western countries -- United States, European Union -- to create, re-create, revive (inaudible) broadcasters like Voice of America or PRL (ph) in Baltic states or central European countries? Thank you.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I don't believe in restricting access to media outlets, even if I don't think they are free media outlets. I believe in telling my people that these are not free media outlets, so this is something which pretends to be media, or it's a government-run media. And we in Estonia, we do not restrict access to these media, yet we discuss this -- these channels and -- and everybody's free to choose whether, for example, to talk to them, and to -- how to react to them. But it needs to be known, and this is important.</p><p>      But we need to not only think in the terms of Russia here. I think it would help everybody in this discussion to realize that the sources of fake news are numerous actually. I mean, I'm -- I'm pretty tough on Russia, but, I mean, sometimes I feel that people attribute all the problems in the global world to Russia. </p><p>      Fake news can come from everywhere. There are various reasons for producing fake news, including somebody may simply want to sell their products, and -- and do away with somebody else's. I don't know. Somebody could say that Asics -- Asics running gear is -- is dangerous to your legs, and that doctors have analyzed and realized that because the first and -- and the back kind of padding are separate -- which is not the case for Nike running shoes -- it's dangerous. </p><p>      So I mean, we have to analyze this in general, and need to teach our people how to check the facts. On the other hand, again, we need to get back a media space which we can trust somehow.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  I think this -- well, let's see. Maybe we have time for two more up there quick. There's a lady here, and then someone who I keep forgetting to go to in the way, way back.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you very much. Susan Ness, SAIS Center for Transatlantic Relations.</p><p>      We talked extensively about the fake news issue. Also, within the European Union, there are efforts underway with respect to hate speech, to curtail that through government regulation. We'd like to know whether there is a major hate speech problem within Estonia, and if so, what role should government play in curtailing hate speech? Thank you.</p><p>      KALJULAID:  First of all, I don't sense that we have a big hate speech problem in Estonia. Second, I think that good habits is something which you shouldn't always try to write into the law text, because if we do away with good habits, and only go by law, then we are not the humankind. We like it, and we want it. So I don't believe in regulating everything.</p><p>      I think most people can recognize when it is hate speech. When -- when it goes to the territory that considerable losses are occurred (ph) to the other party by -- by something which has been said, then we have our court system, which can provide and solve (ph), even in the current legal space, for these cases. But I don't think that, well, you should legislate something you cannot define, really.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  So this will have to be the final one. And I can only see your hand, so I can't say -- oh, there you are.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hi. How do you -- I mean, in terms of the ever-evolving capabilities of A.I., how long until you think machines will supplant the human workforce? And what will the workforce do with their newfound time? And I guess that's the end of my question. </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      KALJULAID:  I am a politician; I'm not clairvoyant. But first of all, we see already that technology does not only take away jobs, but it creates it as well. I gave you a few examples, how I think that actually handicapped people, people with high -- high home-work burden, like women with small children, they actually are much freer to act in the new technology world actively on the job market. </p><p>      So good things are happening, and they're happening also to people with limited education and skills. For example, channeling YouTube may make quite good money, and it doesn't take a degree at all.</p><p>      So new jobs are coming. I don't know where, but the important thing is that we should actually support this change, not try to hold it back. I'm quite sure that in 15 years' time, in industry, all the things we need will be made with the same proportional workforce, which is currently in agriculture, 3 to 4 percent of all workforce, not more. The rest will work elsewhere, and they will do something online. What exactly, who knows? </p><p>      Some things we can see already, but I'm sure there will be much more new stuff emerging, which we cannot imagine right now. At least, I cannot. I have a, well, not very good imagination.</p><p>      SCIUTTO:  Madam President, thank you very much. Just a phenomenal discussion. </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2021457628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1N-3YK1-DY0W-42WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"13778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 4, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00029P0</classCode><className>BAKER &amp;

The move comes amid increasing political pressure on the bloc to curb their market dominance. The draft motion of the European Parliament would ask regulators to consider unbundling, or splitting up, Internet search engines from other commercial services. Although the parliamentary vote is non-binding, such a public call for a break-up would be the most far-reaching action proposed so far, Reuters reports.</p><p>\"We have some doubts about misuse of gatekeeper positions and also leading positions in the markets,\" Ansip said in an interview, stressing that he was not citing particular companies.</p><p>\"I'm not ready to say that they will have to be broken up, talking about vertically integrated structures,\" he said. \"We have to investigate very carefully where those problems are ... and then find possible solutions,\" adding that decisions should only be taken after a full public debate.</p><p>\"For many small and medium-sized companies, for family businesses, because of those vertically integrated structures it's impossible to gain visibility,\" he said. \"And if you are not able to gain visibility it means you are not able to sell,\" Ansip said.</p><p>When Ansip assumed the position, the Wall Street Journal said that he would be a tough opponent for US tech giants. In his speech Ansip said that the abuse of a dominant position is unacceptable, stopping only short of mentioning Google.</p><p>EU authorities have been eyeing Googleand its data collection practices for some time.

Como consecuencia de la crisis sanitaria, est\u00e1 creciendo la interacci\u00f3n digital de los consumidores con sus bancos y, en ese contexto, los modelos de plataforma ofrecen agilidad y escalabilidad en estos tiempos de incertidumbre, seg\u00fan explica el informe, que, adem\u00e1s, pone de manifiesto que a los bancos que utilizan plataformas para la prestaci\u00f3n de sus servicios les resulta dos veces m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil incrementar los beneficios de explotaci\u00f3n, encontrar nuevas formas de valor y mejorar las eficiencias operativas. El informe revela que el sector financiero mundial se encuentra en medio de un proceso hist\u00f3rico de transformaci\u00f3n propiciado por la presencia cada vez mayor en el mercado de actores no tradicionales, \u00e1giles y expertos en el medio digital, que siguen dando la m\u00e1xima relevancia a la experiencia del cliente al tiempo que redefinen los principios que durante mucho tiempo han sustentado al sector. </p><p> El 57% de los consumidores prefieren ya la banca electr\u00f3nica, frente al 49% en el periodo anterior al Covid-19, y son un 55% los que prefieren las aplicaciones m\u00f3viles para gestionar servicios bancarios, frente al 47% anterior, con lo que estos \u00e1mbitos ganan importancia con la pandemia del coronavirus. El informe sugiere que los bancos deben evolucionar hacia modelos basados en plataformas que impulsen el crecimiento y la innovaci\u00f3n que necesitan para seguir siendo competitivos.   El estudio asegura que como consecuencia de haber priorizado los beneficios a corto plazo antes que la sostenibilidad a largo, algunos bancos tienen en la actualidad una acumulaci\u00f3n de sistemas que se est\u00e1n quedando anticuados. Esta situaci\u00f3n dificulta la integraci\u00f3n de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas y, como resultado, afecta a la experiencia del cliente y la excelencia operacional. Sin embargo, a pesar de los inconvenientes de esa tecnolog\u00eda anticuada y de las ventajas de la moderna, los bancos se muestran reacios a tomar medidas de transformaci\u00f3n por el nivel de los recursos requeridos y los riesgos asociados a una implementaci\u00f3n ineficiente. Los directivos del sector bancario reconocen los obst\u00e1culos para el paso a un modelo de plataforma. Seg\u00fan el informe, el 80% de los directivos de banca indica como principales problemas en el proceso hacia este modelo los relacionados con la ciberseguridad y la protecci\u00f3n de la privacidad, seguido de cumplimientos normativos (79%), los sistemas centrales heredados (77%), identificar los colaboradores adecuados (73%) y los sistemas anticuados de gesti\u00f3n de datos (68%). Los estudios  muestran que la modernizaci\u00f3n progresiva es el m\u00e9todo de evoluci\u00f3n preferido (54%) entre los directivos, ya que permitir\u00eda a los bancos actualizar las funciones m\u00e1s cr\u00edticas y transformar gradualmente los antiguos sistemas. La colaboraci\u00f3n es tambi\u00e9n un factor claro de aceleraci\u00f3n. El 66% de directivos del sector afirma que se tarda entre uno y dos a\u00f1os en innovar y lanzar un concepto nuevo cuando se trabaja en solitario; el 58% indica que se tarda menos de un a\u00f1o en lanzar un producto en colaboraci\u00f3n con<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech </emphasis>o<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech</emphasis>.

One wonders, however, if there is a disconnect between the real economy and financial markets, and whether gains are a sign of bubbles.</p><p>Could the low interest-rate climate be the main reason for this performance? Or is it more attributable to the recent US tax reform? What's the role of quantitative easing? And most of all: How long can this last?</p><p>Needless to say, there are no absolute answers. One wonders if uncertainty about economic issues and trade treaties such as Nafta and a tendency to protectionism shown by the Trump administration could bring back some sort of a trade war. At the World Economic Forum at Davos, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said growth should be strengthening both this year and next, but spoke also of \"significant uncertainty,\" noting, \"the long period of low interest rates has led to a buildup of potentially serious financial sector vulnerabilities.\"</p><p>Big Tech companies, whose size and power were extensively discussed at Davos, are the focus of our cover story this month. Their dominance is a very serious issue worldwide, not only for regulators, but for companies, consumers and citizens. The CEO of advertising giant WPP, Martin Sorrell, reminded the Davos audience that Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple from the US, plus Alibaba and Tencent in China, have a market capitalization of US$4 trillion-more than all European listed companies combined-and that Google and Facebook control 75% of the global online advertising market.</p><p>The issue is not merely commercial, but political and social. Facebook product manager Samidh Chakrabarti, reacting to accusations of Russian influence on US elections, recently wrote: \"It's abhorrent to us that a nation-state used our platform to wage a cyberwar intended to divide society.\" He acknowledged that the social media companies whose products are used by two billion people worldwide could not offer any assurance that they are, on balance, good for society: \"I wish I could guarantee that the positives are destined to outweigh the negatives, but I can't.\" Needless to say, it is for all of us to keep an eye on Big Tech and its role in our lives.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, no caption</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GFMAG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GFMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5P-1X11-JC8V-43MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297150</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"375\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Finance Media, Inc.

In an interview to ET\u2019s Anumeha Chaturvedi, Sachin Dave and Vinod Mahanta, he spoke about audit rotation, changing global tax regime, GST and outsourcing in the time of US President Trump. Edited excerpts:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deloitte has recently hired hundreds of people in its advisory business in India. Is the firm moving away from an audit heavy business model in the country to one more focused on consulting?</p><p>Our strategy is very clear \u2013 to have strong businesses in each of our five areas \u2013 audit and assurance, tax and in some countries legal, consulting, risk advisory and financial advisory. In some parts of the world growing auditing is a challenge, like in the Netherlands. In Spain and in India we have been growing advisory side. Our intention is to be strong in each of our segments around the world, and in all the important markets, and India is obviously an important market. So, if you look at it from that perspective, it\u2019s not very surprising and it\u2019s an obvious thing to do. But the shift has been very dramatic over the last one year (in India).</p><p>Is Deloitte global bankrolling the firm\u2019s growth?</p><p>Two years ago we spent a huge amount of time on restating our strategy and what we want to do around the world, and then we had a new leadership team in place \u2013 I became chairman and Punit Renjen became CEO. In 2015 we started making sure that the strategy was executed in all the big markets. So what India is doing is very much part of the global strategy. Just about every member firm is investing in advisory. In Deloitte system, each member firm takes the responsibility of making the investments and over a period gets the support of the rest of the firms. We are investing in consulting capabilities in about 10 countries. Yes, there is technology and other (investments).</p><p>In India some local firms have raised the issue of market concentration among the Big Four and demanded joint audits. Will it improve quality and diversify the market?</p><p>The role of audit is to provide assurance of financial data for capital markets and you need to look at the quality. Is there any evidence that joint audits would assist that? I don\u2019t think there is. If you\u2019re looking at audited financial statements for very complex organisations, a single audit is better. At the moment, wherever we are competing for audit rotation, it feels intensely competitive. Every single audit in Europe has been fought over fiercely.</p><p>How should India go about implementing goods and services tax?</p><p>It is about making sure the systems are working, the codifications are working. The corporate sector has to be involved to test that before all the buttons are pushed. They will be a very good mirror for the government to check whether the system is ready. Trying and testing things with them would be the first thing I would do. Whenever you\u2019re moving to something as dramatic as a countrywide GST, stuff is bound to be rough around the edges in the early days. But as long as there\u2019s a clear mechanism for sorting out and for learning from those I think that\u2019s not a problem. Personally, I think it\u2019s a fantastic achievement to move to a statewide GST. China managed it last year and got everything up and running. It\u2019s one of the lowest cost ways of raising revenue. It brings so many people into the formality of the tax system because they get used to filing and keeping records, and doing things in a proper way. In a relative sense it is easy to apply.</p><p>But some say India has made GST complex...</p><p>Every country has a slightly different interpretation. I wouldn\u2019t say India is special. There\u2019s always politics and issues involved in the execution and it does get reformed. If you look around the world it\u2019s the most effective usage tax with simplicity of application, predictability of revenue and ease of operations.</p><p>Will the changes in tax regulations impact, and even change, global businesses?</p><p>Tax has to be built into the decision-making processes. Tax structures that don\u2019t reflect the commercial positions of companies won\u2019t survive scrutiny. It means tax professionals in companies need to be involved in commercial transactions in the early stage to understand and give advice on the group\u2019s tax position. Tax can\u2019t be left to the end of the year. It needs to be a lot more proactive.</p><p>How do you view measures such as thin capitalisation proposed in India\u2019s last budget to tackle base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)?</p><p>I think India is right in the middle of the pack there. Other countries also implemented some of the other BEPS measures. Other countries have been using BEPS style analysis in looking retrospectively on tax audits. Most countries are doing it on a bit by bit basis.</p><p>Audit business faces a big tech-driven disruption. How is Deloitte preparing for this change?</p><p>We advise companies to be disruptive. So we help companies digitise. Our business itself is prone to disruption. It\u2019s a big data business, so can you have better data analytics and better insights, and we have invested a lot in that. Have we done enough? Hope so. Will we have to do more? Certainly. The other trend is general automation and analytics around other parts of our business. There\u2019s hardly any practice that is not being affected or being disrupted in some way. The pace of business change is the greatest that I can remember.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has been critical of outsourcing. Deloitte also outsources a lot of work to India. Will that change?</p><p>I don\u2019t think the trends of globalisation will change. If anything, they have carried on. Forces of globalisation are still there.

Yearsley's company, Akin, is using AI to create bots that can converse with humans in a lifelike way. Blankenstein's company, Unleash Live, uses AI for real-time analysis of video footage from security cameras and drones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both of them have built their companies around the notion there is money to be made, a business niche to be exploited, by ensuring their AI is ethical, and doesn't use personal information to manipulate or surveil the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And both of them might have taken some comfort in events that have unfolded in the US this past week, had their belief in ethical AI not been borne out under such dramatic and tragic circumstances.</p><p>Following mass protests against racially motivated police brutality, IBM, then Amazon, then Microsoft all put the brakes on the use of AI in mass surveillance last week. They called for better regulation of the technology, and for work towards eliminating the race and gender bias that's widely acknowledged to exist in AI systems, before they allow police forces to use their AI-based facial recognition systems.</p><p>Such AI-based surveillance systems, says Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of NSW, are now at risk of becoming \"toxic assets\" for the companies that develop and sell them, to the point where many companies will be forced to abandon the technology altogether.</p><p>\"Face recognition, along with other misuses of surveillance, is going to be a topic that will trouble us increasingly. These won't be the last tech companies that decide to get out, and rightly so.</p><p>\"AI-based surveillance is just too troubling in many respects,\" he says.</p><p>For Blankenstein's Unleash Live, though, getting out of that technology won't be an issue. The Sydney-based company refused to get into it in the first place, or into any type of AI that uses personal information.</p><p>Unleash Live's AI might analyse the video feed coming from a security camera to help a city decide whether footpaths should be made wider, or to detect that hordes of people are running from some incident that emergency services should be notified about, but the company has made it a selling point that it will never collect or analyse personal information.</p><p>Its platform can never be used by the government to identify people, he says.</p><p>Not only were the ethical implications of mass, computer-based surveillance too troubling, Blankenstein told The Australian Financial Review, but, in any event, that market was already saturated with powerful companies that were all too willing to provide the technology to governments and police forces around the world. Unleash Live recruited its staff with the promise of restricting itself to ethical AI, and many of the staff would quit should the company ever deviate from that, he says.</p><p>Australia's Human Rights Commissioner, Edward Santow, believes that, just as this country has successfully positioned itself as a supplier of safe food to the world, it could also position itself as a supplier of ethically safe technology, especially when it comes to AI.</p><p>AI, he says, has some \"deeply troubling\" human rights implications, not only in the context of racial and gender bias, but also the bigger question of whether it should even be used for applications such as surveillance, even if the bias is eliminated. \"Even if the technology was completely accurate and reliable, that still causes a number of human rights problems. Most obviously, it would significantly affect the right to privacy,\" he told the Financial Review.</p><p>\"For a country like Australia, a middle power that can't compete on scale with countries like the US or China, we need to be really clear on what our niche is. And one niche is that our liberal democratic values are taken seriously. We've always punched above our weight on equality and fairness. We should make that a strength of our AI policy,\" Santow says.</p><p>Indeed, that's already proved to be a strength at Unleashed Live, says Blankenstein. The start-up regularly fields queries from companies that want to ensure its use of AI doesn't involve the use of personal information, and its privacy practices will be governed by Australian law.</p><p>But other countries, too, are making ethical AI part of their pitch to the world, says Santow, and Australia needs to act in the next 12 months to develop a national technology framework that will support the goal.</p><p>Such a framework, which the Human Rights Commission is working on, would help align regulation, government spending and incentives for private investment towards that end.</p><p>\"The government has to get on the front foot when it comes to regulating against serious harms associated with AI and facial recognition,\" Santow says. \"And if they do, there is an opportunity for Australia. We can become known as a country that innovates consistently with our liberal democratic values.\"</p><p>Ellen Broad, a senior fellow in technology policy at the ANU's 3AI institute - a think tank designed to promote responsible innovation - argues serious potential harms from AI go beyond direct effects, such as mass surveillance leading to certain races being more heavily targeted than others. The mere presence of AI in society can have a chilling effect that needs to be guarded against, she says. If people know that computers could be watching their every move, they'll modify their behaviour and might be less willing to do certain things even if computers aren't actually watching them.</p><p>AI has a frightening ability to bring about change in human behaviour, says Akin founder Yearsley. She retired after selling her previous AI company, Cognea Artificial Intelligence, to IBM in 2014, but she says she has now come out of retirement, in part because she's aware of how easily AI could be used to manipulate human behaviour.</p><p>The customer service bots she built at Cognea, which might be used for tasks such as encouraging consumers to take on more credit card debt, were already capable of altering people's behaviour by anywhere between 30 per cent and 200 per cent, she says.</p><p>Unlike humans, AI bots are relentless in their ability to constantly optimise themselves towards a goal. If that goal is to make people consume more and more, as with most AI systems, then heaven help the world, she says.</p><p>\"I don't want to live in a world 10 or 20 years from now where half of my decisions are being made by AI that have fundamentally divergent value systems to me.\"</p><p>Akin was founded, she says, as an experiment in turning AI's capabilities towards positive goals, such as getting people to eat healthily and to exercise more.</p><p>Like Blankenstein, Yearsley is trying to prove that doing so doesn't just make good ethical sense, it makes good business sense, too.</p><p>\"If we can prove that there is a new model of big tech that actually works for humans and will be sustainable, then hopefully others will join that path.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7b0x484nh5v141w02bf3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-K4B1-F0J6-J4MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1192\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.</p><p>\"We need to at least teach people that there's a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,\" said Laura Nor\u00e9n, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. \"You can patch the software, but you can't patch a person if you, you know, damage someone's reputation.\"</p><p>Computer science programs are required to make sure students have an understanding of ethical issues related to computing in order to be accredited by ABET, a global accreditation group for university science and engineering programs. Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses.</p><p>But until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.</p><p>\"Compared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps,\" said Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab.</p><p>One reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning - computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-MIT ethics course.</p><p>\"As we start to see things,</p><p>like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,\" he said. (Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.)</p><p>This past fall, Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges - such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions such as hiring or college admissions.</p><p>\"It was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically,\" said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course.</p><p>In another Cornell course, Karen Levy, also an assistant professor in information science, is teaching her students to focus more on the ethics of tech companies.</p><p>\"A lot of ethically charged decision-making has to do with the choices a company makes: what products they choose to develop, what policies they adopt around user data,\" Levy said. \"If data science ethics training focuses entirely on the individual responsibility of the data scientist, it risks overlooking the role of the broader enterprise.\"</p><p>The Harvard-MIT course, which has 30 students, focuses on the ethical, policy and legal implications of artificial intelligence. It was spurred and financed in part by a new artificial intelligence ethics research fund whose donors include Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn, and the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm of Pierre Omidyar, the eBay founder.</p><p>The curriculum also covers the spread of algorithmic risk scores that use data - such as whether a person was ever suspended from school, or how many of his or her friends have arrest records - to forecast whether someone is likely to commit a crime. Ito said he hoped the course would spur students to ask basic ethical questions, such as: Is the technology fair? How do you make sure that the data is not biased? Should machines be judging humans?</p><p>Some universities offer such programs in their information science, law or philosophy departments. At Stanford, the computer science department will offer the new ethics course, tentatively titled \"Ethics, Public Policy and Computer Science.\"</p><p>The expectations for the course are running high in part because of Sahami's popularity on campus. About 1,500 students take his introductory computer science course every year.</p><p>The new ethics course covers topics such as artificial intelligence and autonomous machines; privacy and civil rights; and platforms like Facebook. Rob Reich, a Stanford political science professor who is helping to develop the course, said students would be asked to consider those topics from the point of view of software engineers, product designers and policymakers. Students will also be assigned to translate ideal solutions into computer code.</p><p>\"Stanford absolutely has a responsibility to play a leadership role in integrating these perspectives, but so does Carnegie Mellon and Caltech and Berkeley and MIT,\" said Jeremy Weinstein, a Stanford political science professor and co-developer of the ethics course. \"The set of institutions that are generating the next generation of leaders in the technology sector have all got to get on this train.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAYDNW-DDN/2018/03/06/Ar02700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAYDNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT7-V921-DYGR-K3WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144574</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Dayton Newspapers, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Dayton Daily News (Ohio)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>STANFORD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>HARVARD UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009FXZ</classCode><className>COMPUTER SCIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000654</classCode><className>ETHICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

David Beasley, head of the U.N.World Food Program joins us from the capital, Addis Ababa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, it's the second Boeing crash in 5 months.  Should passengers be nervous?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the complicated morality of international development in war-torn countries.  I speak with the novelist, Dave Eggers, about his new book, \"The Parade.\"</p><p>Plus, this isn't Hollywood CGI.  Director of the stunning new documentary, \"Apollo 11,\" Todd Douglas Miller, sits down with our Hari Sreenivasan.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Just six minutes after takeoff, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed into the ground and killed all 157 people on board.  Bound for Nairobi, Kenya, its passengers hailed from at least 35 different countries.  Investigators now have the black box and they're looking into similarities with an Indonesian plane crash last October, that was the same Boeing model as this airliner, and we'll have more on that in a moment.</p><p>But first, among those killed in Sunday's crash were 21 employees of the United Nations.  The route is so frequented by them that it's been dubbed the U.N. shuffle and some of them were headed to an environmental summit in Nairobi where colleagues today held this moment of silence in their honor.</p><p>Seven of the dead worked for the World Food Program, the U.N. agency tasked with feeding the world's most desperate people.  Its chief is David Beasley, he's the former governor of South Carolina and he flew to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.  And moments before we spoke, he had received a phone call from Vice President Mike Pence expressing his condolences on behalf of President Trump and the American people.</p><p>Governor Beasley, welcome to the program.  And we just want to offer us sincere condolences.  The U.N. has lost so many people.</p><p>What is it like for you as one of the U.N. chiefs to be out there processing and probably repatriating victims?</p><p>DAVID BEASLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME:  Christiane, it's devastating, it's heartbreaking.  You know, we lose people out on the field, the of battle fields, natural disasters almost every single day but we don't expect something like this.  And, you know, the U.N. system, we've lost over 20 people, at the World Food Program we lost seven, it's just devastating.  But I'm here down in Ethiopia and Addis Ababa meeting with our staff and it is really just so, so sad.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  How are they dealing with it?  Because it is just a catastrophe for all of you to have lost so many people doing such hard work in so many difficult places in the world.  How are your staff dealing with it?</p><p>BEASLEY:  Well, you know, our staff, they're tough.  All over the world, they're dealing with war and tragedies and devastation and hunger and poverty.  But this hits home in such a way that you just can't imagine when seven of your friends, your brothers, your sisters, your colleagues, go down in a crash like this, it's an irony because we don't expect this to happen.</p><p>And today, as I was meeting with our staff, hundreds together here in Addis Ababa, there wasn't a dry eye, there were tears drops and weeping and then hugging and it's just hard to believe.</p><p>And so, our people are putting their lives on the line every day for others.  But today, they were coming together to really try to comfort one another.  And I'll tell you, the support that we've been receiving from all over the world is truly been remarkable, even from the prime minister here in Ethiopia.  I met with him today and president and other leaders that are calling in, it's been a remarkable, the amount of comfort that we're getting from leaders all over the world.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Governor Beasley, you tweeted that in Addis Ababa today in solidarity with the prime minister mourning the lives lost yesterday and pledging our full support together for the families, our hearts are broken at the loss.  What can you do?  Why have you flown from headquarters in Rome there?  What's the best you can do under the circumstances right now?</p><p>BEASLEY:  You know, yesterday when I got this first phone call, you can imagine it's probably one of the darkest days of my life.  And then the secretary general of the United Nations called, another started calling and immediately, we said, \"What can we do?\"  Words can only go so far.  And so, we jumped on a plane and headed down to Ethiopia to be here where the accident took place, where the deficit tool place to comfort those.</p><p>And I think, you know, words can only do so much.  But I think just being here with the friends, being here with the team and our teams in Rome as well because we lost colleagues that operate out of their own headquarters.</p><p>But, Christiane, I'm -- I want to say this because the World Food Programme, we were just one of the many organizations that lost some brave, brave individuals.  And somebody asked me earlier, he said, \"What were these people like?\"  And I said, you know, \"One way there were just average people.  Truly trying to make the world a better place.  But the other side, they're my superheroes.  They lay their lives down every day.\"</p><p>And so, to come down here to just be with them, to hug with them, I don't know what else we could do other just let them know we love them.  And honestly, I think every one of those brave souls that died on that plane, they would want every one of our people to continue on because we're on a campaign to end hunger around the world, we're on the campaign to help people all over the world, and I don't think they want to stop doing.</p><p>And so, we want to continue that spirit, that kindred spirit of loving our neighbor, taking care of one another, being brothers and sisters to one another.  So, it's a tough time but we'll get through it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Governor, you rightly said that there are U.N. workers from other agencies there.  There's yours, the World Food Programme, who are really helping feed the starving around the world and the hungry around the world in warzones, there are people who were associated with the High Commission for Refugees, there are people who were in the Migration Department to the U.N.</p><p>And as you said, I just want to spotlight, one of them was Mick Ryan who is the global deputy chief engineer for World Food Programme.  He is an Irish citizen.  And we have some video of him when he was in Bangladesh trying to set up the refugee camp for the desperately needed Rohingyas.  And the prime minister of Ireland has tweeted, \"Our thoughts are with families of those lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, including the Irish engineer, Michael Ryan.  Michael was doing life changing work in Africa with the World Food Programme.  Deepest sympathies to family, colleagues and friends.\"</p><p>So, this really touches every nation.  Can -- do you remember Michael?  What do you remember about Michael's work?</p><p>BEASLEY:  Well, you know, Mick as we call him.  He was an engineer and we had legit logisticians and accountants and you name it, every walk of life.  And Mick was amazing.  And I can honestly say, because I've been at Cox's Bazar, which has been some of the most difficult places in the world and the most -- I mean, people literally would be dead right now if it weren't for people like Mick who go there and take their expertise and put their lives on the line like he did and others, like Maria and (INAUDIBLE), I can go on and on.</p><p>Mick represented the best of the best.  But in my opinion, he is The World Food Programme.  Men and women like Mick, every day putting their lives literally on the line.  And this is what -- not just the World Food Programme but UNACR and other agencies that are out there doing this every single day.</p><p>And we lose almost a person every single day out there, whether it's a war zone or conflict or natural disaster or kidnappings or whatever the case may be.  And so, we're used to tragedy but this comes in an ironic -- this comes in a way there's a little bit of irony to it as we would say.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, how do you think the work of the organization as a whole, the U.N., will be impacted by the sudden loss of these people?</p><p>BEASLEY:  I think the mood of the World Food Programme, the United Nations, its solidarity.  It brings everybody together.  What this tragedy has done has brought us together with a spirit that I think will rekindle our fire to go out there and continue to fight for people all over the world, to do what's right, to do what's good no matter the circumstances, no matter where, no matter how far.  That's the World Food Programme, and that's the commitment of the humanitarians.</p><p>And so, I don't think it'll dampen our spirit.  I think, in fact, it will bring us together in such a way that it will rekindle our spirit to do even more.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Governor David Beasley, thank you for being with us.  Head of the World Food Programme on this very, very difficult day.</p><p>BEASLEY:  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  A real tragedy for the U.N. workers and the families of 157 people who were killed when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 went down.  It was a new plane, a Boeing model known as the 737 MAX 8.  And that's important because it's the same model as an Indonesian plane that crashed in October, also just minutes after takeoff.  So, should passengers on these jets be worried?</p><p>Mary Schiavo is former inspector general of the Department of Transportation in the United States and she's joining me now from South Carolina.  She's also a lawyer who represents crash victims and has current litigation pending against Boeing.</p><p>Mary Schiavo, welcome to the program.</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, you can imagine everybody around the world is focused on this because of not only the tragedy but because it bears so many similarities to what happened in Indonesia five months ago.  What went through your mind when you heard that this model went down in Ethiopia?</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Oh, no, not again.  And I think that's what's going through the mind of passengers around the world and airlines around the world.  And it's the uncertainty that so problematic and that's why passengers are worried and the internet is literally lighting up with people saying, \"How can I find out if I'm booked on this model of airplane?\"</p><p>So, the worry is real and it will not subside until they download the data from the black boxes, which they got today.  And I think they'll have answers very soon.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Obviously, you know, experts and professionals have to get the evidence before you can start speculating.  But we did have and we have a soundbite of an eyewitness from the ground who actually saw what happened as the plane came down.  Let's just listen to this and see if it matches with some of the thoughts we may have about the crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GADISA BENTI, WITNESSED ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH (through translator):  When it was hovering, fire was coming from its tail, then it tried to lift its nose.  But when it couldn't, it was leaning side to side.  And finally, when it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up.  It went straight into the ground with its nose.  It then exploded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, it's quite descriptive.  He's quite careful, this gentleman, about what he's saying.  And I don't know, Mary, whether you found this important, but he said when it was hovering, fire was --</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- coming out of its tail.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  That's extremely important now.  Air crash investigators often are, you know, a suspect of eyewitness and ear witness reports because sometimes there are problems with what they report and what happened.  But here, this is inconsistent with a problem with the flight controls, a problem with the -- for example, like in Lion Air, it was the angle of tach indicator, here the initial thoughts were the airspeed indicator.</p><p>If in fact, there were flames coming from the aircraft and if in fact, there was smoke and it was a experiencing this problem because of a smoke and flame incident, then that doesn't at all sound like Lion Air.  But up until the point of this, it did sound like Lion Air, same point in flight, same airspeed, same part of the flight on takeoff, pilot reports a problem and is heading back to the airport, those are all so very similar to Lion Air.</p><p>But if this eyewitness is correct, this is hugely important, it changes the way people will look at this, if it's borne out on the black boxes and the cockpit voice recording.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Again, what you've just said is very significant, we have to wait for the actual voice recordings and the other data on those black boxes.</p><p>But is this model, based on what's just happened with these two crashes, is it particularly susceptible to malfunction?</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Well, I think two instances of a malfunction on a brand-new plane takes it past the thought of those as susceptible, it's been shown.  Because in a new model aircraft, ordinarily what newer models do is they bring better safety statistics.  To have two fatal whole losses in less than six months means that you've got a problem.  Maybe it's not the same problem on each flight but, absolutely, Boeing will have to go back, they will have to go back to engineering, not just correcting the flight manuals, not just saying pilots need additional training.</p><p>If this is yet another problem on this model, they're going to have to go back and ask their engineers and literally, take it back to when they decided to make these changes on the plane because the changes stemmed from changing the engines.</p><p>The 737 has been around since 1967 and it's a workhorse.  But something, if this is now a second and different problem yet to boot, that only, I think, raises more concerns about what they need to do and they did go back to engineering.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let me just ask you about Boeing and what it said in the immediate aftermath of this, that they are not issuing new guidance.  Does that surprise you?  Here's the statement that they are saying, \"Safety is our number one priority.  The investigation is in its early stages.  But at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.\"  Is that -- I mean, is that right or should they be more cautious even now?</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Well, to me, that suggests two things.  First and foremost, they don't know.  So, whatever information they have so far, be it messages from the plane, the ACARS systems were functional, whatever information they have, it doesn't seem to fit with something that they already know about the airplane.  So, they can issue new guidance.</p><p>I really don't doubt that if Boeing had an idea that, \"Oh, my gosh.  Lion Air has happened again and these pilots are not -- you know, they haven't had the training or this hasn't fixed the problem,\" I can believe that they would not issue immediate guidance.  But to me that suggests that they know it's not the same, something else is wrong here and we have to figure out what this is, and that's very, you know, disconcerting but, obviously, they wouldn't want to issue the wrong guidance and have them do something that causes even more difficulties, maybe even another loss of a plane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Again, you're saying it may not be the same and you said that after heard this eyewitness talking about the flames.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Yes.  And there was one mention yesterday of someone who said smoke.  So, this would be the second mention.  But this makes it very different from Lion Air if that's correct.  And I go back to TWA 800, it happened way back in 1996.  And there, dozen, scores of witnesses swore that they saw a missile strike the plane.  A missile did not strike the plane.  The center fuel tank exploded.</p><p>So, eyewitnesses can sometimes see things that look differently and perhaps, it could have been fire and smoke from the explosion.  I don't know.  No one knows at this point.  But if this is true and it was on fire in the sky, this is a totally different scenario than Lion Air.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  All right.  So, let's just park that for a moment and wait until we know much more evidence.  However, given the fact that this has now happened twice, for whatever reasons, do you think those in charge, whatever authorities they are, whether it's the FAA in the United States, whether it's the Europeans counterpart over here, should they be grounding the planes?  I know we've already said Boeing is not issuing new guidance.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But should others?  Because as we know, China, Indonesia, Ethiopia and I think the Cayman Islands have all grounded these planes.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Right.  Well, I think they should because there's just too much unknown here.  Until they know what happened, obviously, this is terribly alarming for passengers, for pilots, for operators.  Until you know what has happened, it's just this very, you know, scary situation where you have two planes that have fallen from the sky and they're brand-new planes, that just doesn't happen statistically speaking.  So, I think that a grounding is in order.</p><p>The way that it often works, for example, with the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States of America, they don't do it until they have more evidence.  For example, on the 787 that had the lithium ion battery problem, they had several instances before they took action.  On the grounding of the Douglas Aircraft 10 way back in the 70s, it took many weeks before that was grounded.  And really, a public outcry.</p><p>So, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration really is reticent to do that and they require a lot of evidence.  And in this case, they're following the rest of the world, which is unfortunate, but I do think until they figure out what happened here, they should be grounded, but that doesn't mean that the FAA will do that without more evidence, they usually don't.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, China, obviously, has a lot of these planes.  I mean, that's a lot of planes to ground.  And clearly, that would have a big business impact on Boeing.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Right.  And that's what's so interesting about who has grounded the planes.  For example, Lion Air that last one in October, they have, I think, 25 of these.  This is a large part of their fleet, but they're grounded there.  And for an airline like Southwest, which has a great number.  Southwest has a huge number of 740 or 737 and you would think that that wouldn't be such a big impact on their schedule.</p><p>So, for some of the countries and airlines that have grounded them, that is a huge part of their fleet and they have made a huge commitment, which to me says that they are concerned and rightly so I think.  So, yes, I mean, I think on Boeing, this is -- has a tremendous impact, which is why I have just got to believe that they don't think it is the same thing.  Because if it was, I would have thought they would have issued immediate guidance and said, \"Get those pilots trained and, you know, let's get this under control,\" and they haven't done that.  So, that, to me, says they don't know yet.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, Mary Schiavo, what does that mean, get those pilots trained?  I mean, what is so different about this plane?  I realize that there are differences.  But on the other hand -- well, just on the other hand, 4,500 or so have been purchased, they're the biggest and best selling of the Boeing models, I think in Boeing's history, they have a fuel efficiency capacity.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  You have hit it exactly on the head.  I think this is a watershed event.  I think this is one of those sea chains in aviation.  Because now, we have an aircraft that says, \"You pilot, we're not even going to tell you about this.\"  Before Lion Air, they weren't told, \"We're going to program this plane so it overrides the pilot.\"  We're not talking about a drone aircraft here, we're talking about a 737 and we put our trust in the hands of the pilots.</p><p>And we expect them to be able to fly the plane, I mean, take it off of autopilot, take off the commands and put your hands on the yoke or the stick and the rudder and do it in an emergency.  And this model now says, No, we didn't think it was necessary before Lion Air even to tell you and the plane will override you.\"  We've entered a new era of aviation where the pilot, (INAUDIBLE) says what this is saying to me, might be secondary in the future and this is probably the crossroads.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, this is a really important moment in that case because everybody, as you say --</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- has it safe in the pilot's ability to override the automations when necessary.  Mary Schiavo, thank you very much indeed.  We're no doubt going to be hearing a lot more, obviously, about this in the coming days.</p><p>Now, overall, air travel remains the safest way to go, it is remarkably safe and an extraordinary feat of engineering.  And in a moment, we get a look at what might be humankind's most impressive engineering marvel, which was landing on the moon.  It is the subject of an incredible new documentary.</p><p>But first, the novelist, Dave Eggers, has gained a reputation for chronicling the most important societal upheavals of our time, whether the rise of Silicon Valley or the power of Middle East oil states or Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>His latest book takes on a different moral ambiguity, what happens when foreigners drop in to work and help in developing countries which are ravaged by war.  This novel set in just such an unnamed country is the parade.  And of course, it comes as our conversation comes right in the wake of this crash.  Eggers tells me that it was inspired by some real-world personal experiences.</p><p>Dave Eggers, welcome to the program.</p><p>DAVE EGGERS, AUTHOR, \"THE PARADE\":  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let's talk about your latest book.  And it's actually a continuation almost of some of the books you've written, which you look like a sort of exploration around the world.  This one is really interesting, short but it's about two contractors who are building a road to connect a rural south to an urban north after a war and there's meant to be a parade to celebrate the completion of this road, but it doesn't all go to plan.  Give us the sort of bones of the story without being a spoiler.</p><p>EGGERS:  Well, these are two workers.  They're just pavers, they're contractors that are doing the work as the same way they would anywhere in the world, they drop in without passports, without known identities and they're there to do a job but they take drastically different views on their work and they approach it differently.  One just wants to do the work and go home and get the job done and his a veteran of this kind of work, and the other sees it as an adventure and an invitation to engage deeply in the local culture.  But both approaches are fraught and have their own complications.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, interestingly, you know, you don't name them.  Certainly, you don't name what country they come from but you don't actually give them names, they're called Nine and Four.</p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I -- you know, I wanted them to be nameless and countryless because I think, at least, here in the U.S. we assume that characters like this are representative of American adventurers or interventions abroad.  And this kind of work is not at all exclusive to the U.S.  And particularly, right now, all over the world and in particular in Africa, the Chinese are doing all kinds of road building, port building, railway building.</p><p>And so -- and, you know, years ago in South Sudan, I saw a Swedish team building a road in rural South Sudan and I thought it's -- I was interested in what the Swedish team parachuted into rural South Sudan was thinking and what was -- what did they gather or ruminate on in terms of the implications of their work and sort of where they were, did they know the history, did they know the impact and the possible consequences of that work.</p><p>And so, I wanted them to be kind of nameless because you could insert any sort of industrialized country into sort of the work of these two guys.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let me just -- let me dig down into that.  Because I do find it interesting that you are posing that question about what is the ethics, what is the morality of intervention, even when it looks like intervention to help.</p><p>And, you know, the -- one of the reviews said that, \"Eggers ably weaves in a host of ethical questions, over one man's responsibility to the other, what makes help transactional versus simply kind and whether the road, in this case itself, will truly bring safety and progress to the provinces at 70 miles an hour.  And Eggers is determined to counter the notion that social and economic improvement work hand in hand.\"  Do you agree with that?</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.  That's well said.  I hadn't seen that.  I -- yes.  You know, I don't think that -- I want to make it clear that neither one of these men is at fault.  There isn't a villain, at least, immediately apparent here.  And really, they are such small players in a game that's just -- that they are, again, replaceable in, they are just tools used by -- in a machine that, you know, is far larger than just their work and just their job.</p><p>But within that, you see these two different approaches, where one man says, \"It's not for us to intervene, to help, to aid in any way with the people along the roadside that might need our help.  We are there to do one job and leave.\"  So, he, who is called Four, is just actually not even looking left and right, he's looking straight down to the finish line, the end of their work.</p><p>And Nine sees it as a way, you know, \"We have things that these people might need.  I have a duty to intervene where there -- where I might be able to help.\"  And he's incredibly naive but it comes from an inherent sort of openness and goodness almost.  But both approaches have some deleterious consequences.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Right.</p><p>EGGERS:  And, of course, their work in the end, collectively, has consequences far beyond what they saw.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  I can see you struggling over not wanting to do a spoiler on your own.</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  On your own book.  Look, the last book you wrote was about a coffee grower caught up in the Civil War, the terrible war, in Yemen, which actually is not so much a civil war as one of the outside intervention by big powers.</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And I just, you know, keep thinking also about the previous one you wrote, \"The Circle,\" which was such a huge bestseller, which was, you know, ahead of its time warning about a sort of Google like campus and the whole sort of intrusion into people's privacy and how this technology and A.I. can start to control the environment and control human behavior.  Explain what you're seeing and where you try to examine the interface between humans and their environment.</p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I'm also interested in the workers who individually think that they might be doing good, who are unaware of the larger design, and that was definitely the case in \"The Circle.\"  Individually, each one of those people working at this, you know, presumably idealistic tech campus think that they are improving him an idea and connecting people but they don't realize that the larger design is, you know, surveillance, capitalism and sort of an effort to, you know, create a monopoly, to aggregate power and wealth through, you know, one narrow technological conduit.</p><p>And so, in all of those cases, yes, I'm interested in the people that are part of the machinery and really feel like day-to-day that they are helping but sometimes they don't -- they aren't aware of either the unintended consequences or the consequences that have been preordained or planned but without their --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>EGGERS:  -- knowledge.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean I wonder whether you even imagined that after you had written \"The Circle\" and after it was such a best seller, all this has come out about all the tech companies and whatever Facebook, Google, all of the sort of machinations that are going on.</p><p>And then people are really worried about what this is going to do to the species, to addiction, to as you say monopolies and control.</p><p>I wonder whether you had imagined that it would come true and I guess as a corollary to that, would you support democratic presidential candidates Senator Elizabeth Warren who said she will want to break up these big tech monopolies.</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes, I support what she's saying, absolutely.  I think it's -- they are monopolies and they're acting in a monopolistic way.  And so, we have laws that are meant -- anti-trust laws that are meant to combat that because it's not good a democratic society and it's not good for a capitalist society.</p><p>And so, I do support her in that.  And I thought it was very bold of her to propose it.  It has to be part of the 2020 conversation.  And I had a dim view of this went I wrote the book five years ago.  I thought things were trending one way.  They have gotten far worse.</p><p>But the one thing I'm gratified by or encouraged by is that when I wrote it, most people were still trusting I think of the motivations and business practices of a lot of these -- the larger tech companies.  And right now, I think most people are highly suspicious and highly wary and very open to more regulation and examination--</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Right.  You--</p><p>EGGERS:  That's at least gratifying.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, and last year you came back to this topic.  You did a lecture in which you called for sort of a digital human rights.  And you have said and spoken a lot about it.</p><p>Here you said talking about the complicity here, \"digital tools generally degrade us, specifically they make us in to needy maniacs, and the tech companies that we distrust act no better and no worse than we ourselves act with these tools.</p><p>Our complicity in the rise of these companies and in their increasing power is impossible to avoid or deny.  Every bit of power these companies have is power that we have given them.\"</p><p>So, basically you are there saying that it's not the smart phone or Apple or Zuckerberg that's involved, it's us who involved.  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>EGGERS:  Well the odd thing is, is that we don't have to use Facebook.  There are no laws that require us to use a platform that we inherently distrust and has been proven again and again to abuse and to have distained for the privacy of all of its users.</p><p>And so, there are so many ways to connect with each other online and share photos and all these other things that we want to do.  These wonderful things that we can do without having to empower a very bad actor.</p><p>And so, and that's what's funny to -- and frustrating I guess is that all this power, all this wealth, the aggregation of so much data, it's all data that we have given them for the most part.  And so, we do have choices.  Consumers really have power.</p><p>And I feel like if collectively we said well, this company, Facebook I think is the worst actor of all of them.  If we said we no longer trust you, we're not going to participate in your plan.  We're opting out.  And we're going to a platform like Neewee (ph) which is a nonprofit version of Facebook.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean it strikes me as pretty gulling when I have read now in retrospect that a lot of the great geniuses, the great innovators of this tech and of these devices we're told didn't even allow their own children to use them until a certain age.</p><p>And here now we're talking about the responsibility of citizens.  But citizens who have become addicted, I mean this is lie being on a drug.  How do you get off it?</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.  I can't count the number of tech inventors and innovators and very powerful people who send their kids to (inaudible) schools, which ban all technology at school and in the home.</p><p>And so they know something that a lot of users don't know, which is the highly addictive and (inaudible) sort of consequences of these tools, especially in the hands of very young kids.  They know best.</p><p>And I think that so many parents feel like they have to give their kids devices at a young age to keep them up with societal expectations or educational demands.  And this just isn't the case.  Sometimes these tools are way too powerful to be given to very young kids.</p><p>And I think that we just have to examine that as parents, as educators, schools, everybody really has to slow down a bit and say really what's best for the development of young minds and can we just sort of not channel all of our kids education through screens.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  One of the most adapt users of social media in all of this is the president of the United States.  I mean he is a real master of this art.  You have followed him for awhile.  I mean you've been to rallies in Texas and the rest.  And you've come about -- come away with some really interesting observations.  Notably perhaps that you know, Donald Trump could win again.</p><p>You write, we in the media have long seen Trump as a racist buffoon and a threat but his supporters see him as a man who gets things done, who speaks candidly, who's engineered an economic boom, the envy of the world, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Just give me some, you know, eye witness accounts of your reporting to what makes you lead to your conclusion.</p><p>EGGERS:  I'm here in San Francisco.  We're in a bubble and we make certain assumptions including that he's very vulnerable and will be relatively easy to beat in 2020.  Then I went to that rally in El Paso where he rallied on one side of the street and Beto O'Rourke was on the other.</p><p>And I was shocked to see over the course of the day about 17,000 people line up to go to his rally.  Across the street may three, 4,000 people that go to Beto O'Rourke's rally.  And the people at the Trump rally were a very diverse audience.  El Paso is a very diverse city.</p><p>You know about 80 percent Latino and -- and it was reflected in the audience.  And I interviewed so many people who were so just rational in their support and why they supported him and they ignore so much of the tweeting and so much of the madness that we see in the president's behavior because the economic results over the last few years they value and they see their 401k going up.</p><p>They see employment opportunities available.  They see relatives who are in the military coming home.  They see all these sort of practical effects of the president's policies and they're -- they're giving him a real -- he's -- it makes him formidable for 2020.</p><p>So I came away thinking, all right, it's important to go out and actually interview people and not make assumptions or not get your information third hand from a couch in San Francisco.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Exactly.  Well -- well -- well put.</p><p>EGGERS:  So I think he'll be hard to beat.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well put.  Dave Eggers, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>EGGERS:  Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, where were you when man first stepped on the moon?  Everybody who watched has their own searing memory and they're own story.  Neil Armstrong setting foot out there and declaring, \"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" is the stuff movies and dreams are made of.</p><p>But this very real heroic feat is the subject of a new documentary.  Showing us that moment 50 years ago, this July in a whole new light.  And here's a clip from the trailer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole Apollo Program was designed to get two Americans to the lunar surface and back again to earth safely.  The enormity of this event is something that only history will be able to judge.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Todd Douglas Miller is the director of Apollo 11.  He's been speaking with our Hari Sreenivasan about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CNNI HOST:  You know never before seen footage is often used as a marketing gimmick.  But in this case it completely changed the composition of your film.</p><p>TODD DOUGLAS MILLER, DIRECTOR OF APOLLO 11:  Yes, I mean initially -- and this was the tail end of 2016, we cast a very wide net within the spider web network of NASA facilities and also the National Archives.</p><p>And three or four months into the project we get this email from the National Archives, our contact there, our archivist (ph) who said that they had -- had this collection of large format material that was previously, you know, uncataloged.</p><p>They didn't really know exactly what was on it.  They had -- it did have written on some of the reels, Apollo 11.  Some of the dates ended around the launch, which was July 16th of 1969.  So that began the process of discovering exactly what these were.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  How much footage are we talking about?</p><p>MILLER:  So hundreds of reels.  And it just wasn't in National Archives.  We also had access to another 100 reels of engineering 70 millimeter footage. So that's all the great slow motion, you know, rocket -- of the rocket taking off.  We had a ton of that stuff to go through.  And then if that wasn't enough, we were also alerted to over 11,000 hours of mission control audio that was uncovered by NASA.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  How do you get 11,000 hours?  I mean, what is - what are they recording for that long?</p><p>MILLER:  So it was really unique.  It was one inch tape.  If you could imagine, if you're sitting in mission control, you have 30 flight controllers.  Each one of those guys that's on a headset is recorded on a track in the back.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  So really, every word that was uttered in mission control had been recorded and sitting, gathering dust?</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, and not only that.  The backroom, each flight controller had an entire backroom full of other light controllers.  So they were all on loops.  So it was really, in essence, about 60 tracks that all needed to be synched up.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  But why take this on?  I mean, at this point, we probably have a memory of seeing that black and white footage.  Why - why do this as a film?</p><p>MILLER:  You know, it really started as an editing exercise, you know, with my archive producer Stephen Slater who's based in the U.K.  He had been synching up a lot of mission control footage with audio because when they originally shot it, it didn't have any sound on it.</p><p>So, you know, it gets addictive, you know, to try to figure out what these guys are saying at what times because they really shot it with no regard for if, you know, there was going to be any audio.  They were just kind of getting beauty shots of these guys working and documenting them for historical purposes.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  And once the large format stuff came into our purview, it felt like, you know, it - we were all, you know, wanting to work on something like this.  So we were kind of - it was the perfect team for this to land on.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  So you find all this video - film and you find all this audio.  What do you learn about this?</p><p>MILLER:  We learned a lot.  I mean, probably the greatest part of working on the project was working very closely with NASA's chief historian, Bill Barry, and his team, obviously, the National Archives as well, and then the families and Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.  Neil Armstrong's sons, Rick and Mark, they were one of the first people that we showed this footage to before we even started the process of -</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  What'd they think?</p><p>MILLER:  I mean, they were floored like everyone else.  You know, just when you thought you'd seen it all, and particularly for them.  I mean, they - you know, they were so gracious with their time in helping us out to, you know, really get the accuracy of not only the mission but also just the spirit of who their fathers were and the people that worked with them.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  But what is it about this moment, I mean - which might not happen ever again, maybe until we set foot on Mars or the aliens come down and talk to us?  It almost seemed to unite the entire planet.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  It was not lost on us at any time.  I can speak for the entire team.  It was just such a unique experience to - to witness the sheer scope of this.  You know, you put yourself back in the `60s and with JFK in this charge to the country to try to drum up support for the space program, which is very expensive to send someone to another planet or another world.</p><p>And all the political strife that was going on, you know, JFK himself, a year after his - his speech in Texas, is assassinated in Texas.  His brother is assassinated.  Dr. Martin Luther King is assassinated.  You have the background of the Vietnam War, but throughout all of that, you have hundreds of thousands of people that are spread across tens of thousands of companies that all came together to accomplish this one goal of putting a human on another world.  And it was - it's just miraculous.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  And you've got a clip of that that I want to show as well.  It starts with just kind of a long shot of how many people.  It's dizzying, even to think about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're past the six-minute mark in our countdown for Apollo 11.  Now, five minutes 52 seconds and counting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upward.  The vehicle weighs close to 6.5 million pounds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  That is a lot of people, and that's just a clip from the film to illustrate your point.  You know, one of the things that I remembered and I think most people nowadays, if - when they go to your film, what they'll see is - well, the first shots you had of mission control, it was almost like it was a uniform.  It was all white shirts, half-sleeve, with a tie, and almost all men.  There was one woman in the room that really caught - I was like, \"Wait a minute.  What's her story?\"</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, that's the beauty of really doing the research and going deep into the archive with the entire Apollo program.  There is one woman, her name is JoAnn Morgan.</p><p>Apollo 11 was the first time that she actually was in the firing room which was the launch control center which was adjacent to the pad down in Florida what was called Cape Kennedy at the time now, today Cape Canaveral.  And before the Saturn V rocket launched, she was just an amazing engineer.</p><p>She was there on her own credentials, didn't matter that she was a female.  And she ended up having a very long history with NASA.  Worked there for 43 years, retired and is still alive today.  And it just wasn't her.  We had unfortunately and hopefully this ends up on like a Blu-ray or DVD.</p><p>There was a 25 year old (inaudible) that was in the back room in mission control.  Her name was Poppy Northcutt; she actually on Apollo 13 was in the front room.  But there's a moment after lunar liftoff when they're arguing -- the flight controllers in the front room are arguing over flight trajectories.</p><p>So they consult with the back room.  Poppy comes on, and basically just schools these guys in some math.  And while their numbers are off and she's trying to articulate why they're wrong.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  And it takes about five minutes for her to finally get through to these guys.  But it just highlights the great effort of all, just not male, female, minorities across all races to put this thing together.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  One thing that surprised me was relatively speaking how advance the technology in some way was.  They were getting near real-time heart beats of these astronauts.  And I had no idea that in 1969 we had the tech and then afterwards I was stunned by how low and how cool they are.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, I mean sometimes I have a tough time calling my sister back in Ohio.  So, it's just a testament to the technological advances that the Apollo program did.  Certainly, if you listen to the air to ground transmissions, it's scratchy most of th time.  It's tough stuff to get through.</p><p>But they did it.  And they developed ways to communicate.  And that was just one of dozens of new technologies that were invented to put someone on the surface of the moon.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  At one point, at the takeoff I think, Buzz Aldrin's heart beat is around 88.  And then on the other end of the spectrum, Neil Armstrong's heart beat when he's about to land the thing is what, 100--</p><p>MILLER:  155.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  That is me on a treadmill at a good run, right?  I mean that's really exerting ourselves.  And here he is, the stress of that moment, you could see it was in his heart right there.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, but when you listen to Neil Armstrong's (inaudible) as they're landing, it never waivers.  So, he might've been stressing on the inside, but on the outside and it goes for all of the mission controllers during that moment.  Charley Duke famously says, \"Copy Eagle, you got a bunch of guys ready to turn blue here.  We're breathing again.\"</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  And it just goes to show kind of the nerves of steel.  And you have to remember, Buzz and Neil both were Korean War veterans.  They flew missions, dozens and dozens of combat missions.  Buzz himself shot down a mig (ph) and then pulled out a camera and photographed the pilot ejecting.</p><p>These guys had been hardened veterans of not only war but they were test pilots.  And unlike some of their predecessors in the space program, they were educated.  Neil had a degree in aeronautics.  Buzz went to MIT.  And they -- his nickname was Dr. Randevu.</p><p>Michael Collins was a graduate at West Point and ended up in the air force.  So, these guys had been around the block.  And it's no -- now you know why they were chosen to go about this extraordinary mission.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  And there was flying required back then.  I mean the -- we kind of take it for granted now.  But to get these things to connect and disconnect and really ultimately landing of where the module landed was by hand.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, Neil Armstrong certainly they had very archaic computers compared to now.  But to get them to a certain altitude and then Neil actually -- Neil Armstrong himself guided the lunar lander down to the surface of the moon.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Going through all this footage, what surprised you?</p><p>MILLER:  I think if you see the suiting up shots that was the most surprising for me.  I had seen those images a lot over the decades.  But I had never seen them like that.  And just opposed (ph) a real that came shortly after we had that real which from the day of the launch, the morning of the launch.  They're getting suited up to go on this amazing thing -- journey.</p><p>There was -- they were doing the same thing a few days before on a dry run.  And they were kind of slapping themselves on the back.  A bit jovial.  You know they did the same thing.  They went into the astrovan, drove out to the pad, got in the elevator, went -- sat on top of the rocket, came back down and went home.</p><p>But on the day of the launch, you just see this look on their faces.  There was no joking and you could just see the weight of what they were about to do written all over it.  And it just really snapped into focus, I think for all of us.</p><p>Their responsibility that they had to do that and also, you know in a very small way, our responsibility, you know to the imagery that we were luckily enough to be granted to work with.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  I didn't realize one of the first things that happened on the moon was to set up a camera.  I mean just like well there's scientific gear, et cetera, et cetera.  Actually he sets up the camera and you can see all of these shots of Buzz Aldrin coming down.</p><p>I mean it was just -- there's certainly forethought put in to what they should do and how it should be documented for the entire world to see.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, the training was immense.  They -- you know they rehearsed down to the second exactly all the moves, choreographed.  One of the kind of humorous things was when they landed they were actually supposed to sleep.  They were supposed to have a sleep period.</p><p>But of course you land on the moon and I don't think anybody's going -- anybody's going to go to bed.  So they requested if they could, you know, perform their lunar excursion activities, the EVA first.  They were granted that.</p><p>And some of that imagery that we saw, you know at first, quite frankly the engineers at Goldstone, California weren't ready for it.  So that's why the image is flipped upside down.  There wasn't -- you know originally it was supposed to go to Australia and just the way that signal was, you know, sent to the earth it ended up at California.</p><p>So, you know, luckily we do have that imagery and lucky, you know, for me as a film maker, Buzz Aldrin documented with a 16 millimeter camera looking right down the barrel of the later, Neil's first steps.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Just suppose that capsule with what just happened a little awhile ago, SpaceX sending a capsule up, I mean you look around and every shot Buzz Aldrin -- the Armstrong, there's just switches and gear and buttons and lights everywhere.  And now it's this clean white wall, two LED screens.</p><p>I mean it's amazing that these three humans had to know how to work all of that manually.</p><p>MILLER:  What we've accomplished in 50 years, you know on the technology front, I think is -- is truly amazing and I'm -- I'm actually encouraged that you know companies like SpaceX working with NASA and all the great, you know, space programs all around the world, it's a very exciting time for the future of space travel because we're going to have to get out there, you know, at some point.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Why doesn't the government undertake anything like this?  Could it?  Should it?  Is it going to be replaced by private companies and is that the right way to get going in space?</p><p>MILLER:  I could speak to the historical context, which is -- you know John F. Kennedy made a charge to the country and -- and -- and went out and actually sold this.  So there was a political will that was established to make this happen.  Our legacy of Apollo, I think should be followed up.  It's inevitable.</p><p>You know we're -- as we grow as a population worldwide where we need, you know, new places to go.  Whether it happens, you know, a hundred years from now, a thousand, a million; it's going to happen.</p><p>And Apollo 11 serves as a -- the entire program serves as a -- as a primer for us to -- to get back out there.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Is that what you want people to take away from the film?</p><p>MILLER:  I think so but also just to be reminded that over the decades and as time has evolved, you know we -- we kind of get into our boxes, if you will, and events like this bring us together.  They unite us and they certainly did back then and they certainly can do again.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MILLER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, I for one can never get enough of Apollo 11 and I'm going to be running, not walking to go and see this film.  And as Hari said in a sign of just how much private industry has taken over the space program, SpaceX just fully tested its dragon capsule, sending it to the international space station and then back to earth.</p><p>The company hopes the capsule will soon carry human astronauts, which would indeed be a landmark achievement for a private enterprise.  And that is it for now.  Remember you can always listen to our podcast.  You can see us online at amanpour.com and you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.

David Beasley, head of the U.N.World Food Program joins us from the capital, Addis Ababa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, it's the second Boeing crash in 5 months. Should passengers be nervous?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the complicated morality of international development in war-torn countries. I speak with the novelist, Dave Eggers, about his new book, \"The Parade.\"</p><p>Plus, this isn't Hollywood CGI. Director of the stunning new documentary, \"Apollo 11,\" Todd Douglas Miller, sits down with our Hari Sreenivasan.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Just six minutes after takeoff, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed into the ground and killed all 157 people on board. Bound for Nairobi, Kenya, its passengers hailed from at least 35 different countries. Investigators now have the black box and they're looking into similarities with an Indonesian plane crash last October, that was the same Boeing model as this airliner, and we'll have more on that in a moment.</p><p>But first, among those killed in Sunday's crash were 21 employees of the United Nations. The route is so frequented by them that it's been dubbed the U.N. shuffle and some of them were headed to an environmental summit in Nairobi where colleagues today held this moment of silence in their honor.</p><p>Seven of the dead worked for the World Food Program, the U.N. agency tasked with feeding the world's most desperate people. Its chief is David Beasley, he's the former governor of South Carolina and he flew to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. And moments before we spoke, he had received a phone call from Vice President Mike Pence expressing his condolences on behalf of President Trump and the American people.</p><p>Governor Beasley, welcome to the program. And we just want to offer us sincere condolences. The U.N. has lost so many people.</p><p>What is it like for you as one of the U.N. chiefs to be out there processing and probably repatriating victims?</p><p>DAVID BEASLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME: Christiane, it's devastating, it's heartbreaking. You know, we lose people out on the field, the of battle fields, natural disasters almost every single day but we don't expect something like this. And, you know, the U.N. system, we've lost over 20 people, at the World Food Program we lost seven, it's just devastating. But I'm here down in Ethiopia and Addis Ababa meeting with our staff and it is really just so, so sad.</p><p>AMANPOUR: How are they dealing with it? Because it is just a catastrophe for all of you to have lost so many people doing such hard work in so many difficult places in the world. How are your staff dealing with it?</p><p>BEASLEY: Well, you know, our staff, they're tough. All over the world, they're dealing with war and tragedies and devastation and hunger and poverty. But this hits home in such a way that you just can't imagine when seven of your friends, your brothers, your sisters, your colleagues, go down in a crash like this, it's an irony because we don't expect this to happen.</p><p>And today, as I was meeting with our staff, hundreds together here in Addis Ababa, there wasn't a dry eye, there were tears drops and weeping and then hugging and it's just hard to believe.</p><p>And so, our people are putting their lives on the line every day for others. But today, they were coming together to really try to comfort one another. And I'll tell you, the support that we've been receiving from all over the world is truly been remarkable, even from the prime minister here in Ethiopia. I met with him today and president and other leaders that are calling in, it's been a remarkable, the amount of comfort that we're getting from leaders all over the world.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Governor Beasley, you tweeted that in Addis Ababa today in solidarity with the prime minister mourning the lives lost yesterday and pledging our full support together for the families, our hearts are broken at the loss. What can you do? Why have you flown from headquarters in Rome there? What's the best you can do under the circumstances right now?</p><p>BEASLEY: You know, yesterday when I got this first phone call, you can imagine it's probably one of the darkest days of my life. And then the secretary general of the United Nations called, another started calling and immediately, we said, \"What can we do?\" Words can only go so far. And so, we jumped on a plane and headed down to Ethiopia to be here where the accident took place, where the deficit tool place to comfort those.</p><p>And I think, you know, words can only do so much. But I think just being here with the friends, being here with the team and our teams in Rome as well because we lost colleagues that operate out of their own headquarters.</p><p>But, Christiane, I'm -- I want to say this because the World Food Programme, we were just one of the many organizations that lost some brave, brave individuals. And somebody asked me earlier, he said, \"What were these people like?\" And I said, you know, \"One way there were just average people. Truly trying to make the world a better place. But the other side, they're my superheroes. They lay their lives down every day.\"</p><p>And so, to come down here to just be with them, to hug with them, I don't know what else we could do other just let them know we love them. And honestly, I think every one of those brave souls that died on that plane, they would want every one of our people to continue on because we're on a campaign to end hunger around the world, we're on the campaign to help people all over the world, and I don't think they want to stop doing.</p><p>And so, we want to continue that spirit, that kindred spirit of loving our neighbor, taking care of one another, being brothers and sisters to one another. So, it's a tough time but we'll get through it.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Governor, you rightly said that there are U.N. workers from other agencies there. There's yours, the World Food Programme, who are really helping feed the starving around the world and the hungry around the world in warzones, there are people who were associated with the High Commission for Refugees, there are people who were in the Migration Department to the U.N.</p><p>And as you said, I just want to spotlight, one of them was Mick Ryan who is the global deputy chief engineer for World Food Programme. He is an Irish citizen. And we have some video of him when he was in Bangladesh trying to set up the refugee camp for the desperately needed Rohingyas. And the prime minister of Ireland has tweeted, \"Our thoughts are with families of those lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, including the Irish engineer, Michael Ryan. Michael was doing life changing work in Africa with the World Food Programme. Deepest sympathies to family, colleagues and friends.\"</p><p>So, this really touches every nation. Can -- do you remember Michael? What do you remember about Michael's work?</p><p>BEASLEY: Well, you know, Mick as we call him. He was an engineer and we had legit logisticians and accountants and you name it, every walk of life. And Mick was amazing. And I can honestly say, because I've been at Cox's Bazar, which has been some of the most difficult places in the world and the most -- I mean, people literally would be dead right now if it weren't for people like Mick who go there and take their expertise and put their lives on the line like he did and others, like Maria and (INAUDIBLE), I can go on and on.</p><p>Mick represented the best of the best. But in my opinion, he is The World Food Programme. Men and women like Mick, every day putting their lives literally on the line. And this is what -- not just the World Food Programme but UNACR and other agencies that are out there doing this every single day.</p><p>And we lose almost a person every single day out there, whether it's a war zone or conflict or natural disaster or kidnappings or whatever the case may be. And so, we're used to tragedy but this comes in an ironic -- this comes in a way there's a little bit of irony to it as we would say.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, how do you think the work of the organization as a whole, the U.N., will be impacted by the sudden loss of these people?</p><p>BEASLEY: I think the mood of the World Food Programme, the United Nations, its solidarity. It brings everybody together. What this tragedy has done has brought us together with a spirit that I think will rekindle our fire to go out there and continue to fight for people all over the world, to do what's right, to do what's good no matter the circumstances, no matter where, no matter how far. That's the World Food Programme, and that's the commitment of the humanitarians.</p><p>And so, I don't think it'll dampen our spirit. I think, in fact, it will bring us together in such a way that it will rekindle our spirit to do even more.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Governor David Beasley, thank you for being with us. Head of the World Food Programme on this very, very difficult day.</p><p>BEASLEY: Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: A real tragedy for the U.N. workers and the families of 157 people who were killed when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 went down. It was a new plane, a Boeing model known as the 737 MAX 8. And that's important because it's the same model as an Indonesian plane that crashed in October, also just minutes after takeoff. So, should passengers on these jets be worried?</p><p>Mary Schiavo is former inspector general of the Department of Transportation in the United States and she's joining me now from South Carolina. She's also a lawyer who represents crash victims and has current litigation pending against Boeing.</p><p>Mary Schiavo, welcome to the program.</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT: Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, you can imagine everybody around the world is focused on this because of not only the tragedy but because it bears so many similarities to what happened in Indonesia five months ago. What went through your mind when you heard that this model went down in Ethiopia?</p><p>SCHIAVO: Oh, no, not again. And I think that's what's going through the mind of passengers around the world and airlines around the world. And it's the uncertainty that so problematic and that's why passengers are worried and the internet is literally lighting up with people saying, \"How can I find out if I'm booked on this model of airplane?\"</p><p>So, the worry is real and it will not subside until they download the data from the black boxes, which they got today. And I think they'll have answers very soon.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Obviously, you know, experts and professionals have to get the evidence before you can start speculating. But we did have and we have a soundbite of an eyewitness from the ground who actually saw what happened as the plane came down. Let's just listen to this and see if it matches with some of the thoughts we may have about the crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GADISA BENTI, WITNESSED ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH (through translator): When it was hovering, fire was coming from its tail, then it tried to lift its nose. But when it couldn't, it was leaning side to side. And finally, when it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up. It went straight into the ground with its nose. It then exploded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, it's quite descriptive. He's quite careful, this gentleman, about what he's saying. And I don't know, Mary, whether you found this important, but he said when it was hovering, fire was --</p><p>SCHIAVO: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- coming out of its tail.</p><p>SCHIAVO: That's extremely important now. Air crash investigators often are, you know, a suspect of eyewitness and ear witness reports because sometimes there are problems with what they report and what happened. But here, this is inconsistent with a problem with the flight controls, a problem with the -- for example, like in Lion Air, it was the angle of tach indicator, here the initial thoughts were the airspeed indicator.</p><p>If in fact, there were flames coming from the aircraft and if in fact, there was smoke and it was a experiencing this problem because of a smoke and flame incident, then that doesn't at all sound like Lion Air. But up until the point of this, it did sound like Lion Air, same point in flight, same airspeed, same part of the flight on takeoff, pilot reports a problem and is heading back to the airport, those are all so very similar to Lion Air.</p><p>But if this eyewitness is correct, this is hugely important, it changes the way people will look at this, if it's borne out on the black boxes and the cockpit voice recording.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Again, what you've just said is very significant, we have to wait for the actual voice recordings and the other data on those black boxes.</p><p>But is this model, based on what's just happened with these two crashes, is it particularly susceptible to malfunction?</p><p>SCHIAVO: Well, I think two instances of a malfunction on a brand-new plane takes it past the thought of those as susceptible, it's been shown. Because in a new model aircraft, ordinarily what newer models do is they bring better safety statistics. To have two fatal whole losses in less than six months means that you've got a problem. Maybe it's not the same problem on each flight but, absolutely, Boeing will have to go back, they will have to go back to engineering, not just correcting the flight manuals, not just saying pilots need additional training.</p><p>If this is yet another problem on this model, they're going to have to go back and ask their engineers and literally, take it back to when they decided to make these changes on the plane because the changes stemmed from changing the engines.</p><p>The 737 has been around since 1967 and it's a workhorse. But something, if this is now a second and different problem yet to boot, that only, I think, raises more concerns about what they need to do and they did go back to engineering.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let me just ask you about Boeing and what it said in the immediate aftermath of this, that they are not issuing new guidance. Does that surprise you? Here's the statement that they are saying, \"Safety is our number one priority. The investigation is in its early stages. But at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.\" Is that -- I mean, is that right or should they be more cautious even now?</p><p>SCHIAVO: Well, to me, that suggests two things. First and foremost, they don't know. So, whatever information they have so far, be it messages from the plane, the ACARS systems were functional, whatever information they have, it doesn't seem to fit with something that they already know about the airplane. So, they can issue new guidance.</p><p>I really don't doubt that if Boeing had an idea that, \"Oh, my gosh. Lion Air has happened again and these pilots are not -- you know, they haven't had the training or this hasn't fixed the problem,\" I can believe that they would not issue immediate guidance. But to me that suggests that they know it's not the same, something else is wrong here and we have to figure out what this is, and that's very, you know, disconcerting but, obviously, they wouldn't want to issue the wrong guidance and have them do something that causes even more difficulties, maybe even another loss of a plane.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Again, you're saying it may not be the same and you said that after heard this eyewitness talking about the flames.</p><p>SCHIAVO: Yes. And there was one mention yesterday of someone who said smoke. So, this would be the second mention. But this makes it very different from Lion Air if that's correct. And I go back to TWA 800, it happened way back in 1996. And there, dozen, scores of witnesses swore that they saw a missile strike the plane. A missile did not strike the plane. The center fuel tank exploded.</p><p>So, eyewitnesses can sometimes see things that look differently and perhaps, it could have been fire and smoke from the explosion. I don't know. No one knows at this point. But if this is true and it was on fire in the sky, this is a totally different scenario than Lion Air.</p><p>AMANPOUR: All right. So, let's just park that for a moment and wait until we know much more evidence. However, given the fact that this has now happened twice, for whatever reasons, do you think those in charge, whatever authorities they are, whether it's the FAA in the United States, whether it's the Europeans counterpart over here, should they be grounding the planes? I know we've already said Boeing is not issuing new guidance.</p><p>SCHIAVO: Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR: But should others? Because as we know, China, Indonesia, Ethiopia and I think the Cayman Islands have all grounded these planes.</p><p>SCHIAVO: Right. Well, I think they should because there's just too much unknown here. Until they know what happened, obviously, this is terribly alarming for passengers, for pilots, for operators. Until you know what has happened, it's just this very, you know, scary situation where you have two planes that have fallen from the sky and they're brand-new planes, that just doesn't happen statistically speaking. So, I think that a grounding is in order.</p><p>The way that it often works, for example, with the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States of America, they don't do it until they have more evidence. For example, on the 787 that had the lithium ion battery problem, they had several instances before they took action. On the grounding of the Douglas Aircraft 10 way back in the 70s, it took many weeks before that was grounded. And really, a public outcry.</p><p>So, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration really is reticent to do that and they require a lot of evidence. And in this case, they're following the rest of the world, which is unfortunate, but I do think until they figure out what happened here, they should be grounded, but that doesn't mean that the FAA will do that without more evidence, they usually don't.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean, China, obviously, has a lot of these planes. I mean, that's a lot of planes to ground. And clearly, that would have a big business impact on Boeing.</p><p>SCHIAVO: Right. And that's what's so interesting about who has grounded the planes. For example, Lion Air that last one in October, they have, I think, 25 of these. This is a large part of their fleet, but they're grounded there. And for an airline like Southwest, which has a great number. Southwest has a huge number of 740 or 737 and you would think that that wouldn't be such a big impact on their schedule.</p><p>So, for some of the countries and airlines that have grounded them, that is a huge part of their fleet and they have made a huge commitment, which to me says that they are concerned and rightly so I think. So, yes, I mean, I think on Boeing, this is -- has a tremendous impact, which is why I have just got to believe that they don't think it is the same thing. Because if it was, I would have thought they would have issued immediate guidance and said, \"Get those pilots trained and, you know, let's get this under control,\" and they haven't done that. So, that, to me, says they don't know yet.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, Mary Schiavo, what does that mean, get those pilots trained? I mean, what is so different about this plane? I realize that there are differences. But on the other hand -- well, just on the other hand, 4,500 or so have been purchased, they're the biggest and best selling of the Boeing models, I think in Boeing's history, they have a fuel efficiency capacity.</p><p>SCHIAVO: You have hit it exactly on the head. I think this is a watershed event. I think this is one of those sea chains in aviation. Because now, we have an aircraft that says, \"You pilot, we're not even going to tell you about this.\" Before Lion Air, they weren't told, \"We're going to program this plane so it overrides the pilot.\" We're not talking about a drone aircraft here, we're talking about a 737 and we put our trust in the hands of the pilots.</p><p>And we expect them to be able to fly the plane, I mean, take it off of autopilot, take off the commands and put your hands on the yoke or the stick and the rudder and do it in an emergency. And this model now says, No, we didn't think it was necessary before Lion Air even to tell you and the plane will override you.\" We've entered a new era of aviation where the pilot, (INAUDIBLE) says what this is saying to me, might be secondary in the future and this is probably the crossroads.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, this is a really important moment in that case because everybody, as you say --</p><p>SCHIAVO: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: -- has it safe in the pilot's ability to override the automations when necessary. Mary Schiavo, thank you very much indeed. We're no doubt going to be hearing a lot more, obviously, about this in the coming days.</p><p>Now, overall, air travel remains the safest way to go, it is remarkably safe and an extraordinary feat of engineering. And in a moment, we get a look at what might be humankind's most impressive engineering marvel, which was landing on the moon. It is the subject of an incredible new documentary.</p><p>But first, the novelist, Dave Eggers, has gained a reputation for chronicling the most important societal upheavals of our time, whether the rise of Silicon Valley or the power of Middle East oil states or Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>His latest book takes on a different moral ambiguity, what happens when foreigners drop in to work and help in developing countries which are ravaged by war. This novel set in just such an unnamed country is the parade. And of course, it comes as our conversation comes right in the wake of this crash. Eggers tells me that it was inspired by some real- world personal experiences.</p><p>Dave Eggers, welcome to the program.</p><p>DAVE EGGERS, AUTHOR, \"THE PARADE\": Thank you. Thanks for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let's talk about your latest book. And it's actually a continuation almost of some of the books you've written, which you look like a sort of exploration around the world. This one is really interesting, short but it's about two contractors who are building a road to connect a rural south to an urban north after a war and there's meant to be a parade to celebrate the completion of this road, but it doesn't all go to plan. Give us the sort of bones of the story without being a spoiler.</p><p>EGGERS: Well, these are two workers. They're just pavers, they're contractors that are doing the work as the same way they would anywhere in the world, they drop in without passports, without known identities and they're there to do a job but they take drastically different views on their work and they approach it differently. One just wants to do the work and go home and get the job done and his a veteran of this kind of work, and the other sees it as an adventure and an invitation to engage deeply in the local culture. But both approaches are fraught and have their own complications.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, interestingly, you know, you don't name them. Certainly, you don't name what country they come from but you don't actually give them names, they're called Nine and Four.</p><p>EGGERS: Well, I -- you know, I wanted them to be nameless and countryless because I think, at least, here in the U.S. we assume that characters like this are representative of American adventurers or interventions abroad. And this kind of work is not at all exclusive to the U.S. And particularly, right now, all over the world and in particular in Africa, the Chinese are doing all kinds of road building, port building, railway building.</p><p>And so -- and, you know, years ago in South Sudan, I saw a Swedish team building a road in rural South Sudan and I thought it's -- I was interested in what the Swedish team parachuted into rural South Sudan was thinking and what was -- what did they gather or ruminate on in terms of the implications of their work and sort of where they were, did they know the history, did they know the impact and the possible consequences of that work.</p><p>And so, I wanted them to be kind of nameless because you could insert any sort of industrialized country into sort of the work of these two guys.</p><p>AMANPOUR: So, let me just -- let me dig down into that. Because I do find it interesting that you are posing that question about what is the ethics, what is the morality of intervention, even when it looks like intervention to help.</p><p>And, you know, the -- one of the reviews said that, \"Eggers ably weaves in a host of ethical questions, over one man's responsibility to the other, what makes help transactional versus simply kind and whether the road, in this case itself, will truly bring safety and progress to the provinces at 70 miles an hour. And Eggers is determined to counter the notion that social and economic improvement work hand in hand.\" Do you agree with that?</p><p>EGGERS: Yes. That's well said. I hadn't seen that. I -- yes. You know, I don't think that -- I want to make it clear that neither one of these men is at fault. There isn't a villain, at least, immediately apparent here. And really, they are such small players in a game that's just -- that they are, again, replaceable in, they are just tools used by -- in a machine that, you know, is far larger than just their work and just their job.</p><p>But within that, you see these two different approaches, where one man says, \"It's not for us to intervene, to help, to aid in any way with the people along the roadside that might need our help. We are there to do one job and leave.\" So, he, who is called Four, is just actually not even looking left and right, he's looking straight down to the finish line, the end of their work.</p><p>And Nine sees it as a way, you know, \"We have things that these people might need. I have a duty to intervene where there -- where I might be able to help.\" And he's incredibly naive but it comes from an inherent sort of openness and goodness almost. But both approaches have some deleterious consequences.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right.</p><p>EGGERS: And, of course, their work in the end, collectively, has consequences far beyond what they saw.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes. I can see you struggling over not wanting to do a spoiler on your own.</p><p>EGGERS: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: On your own book. Look, the last book you wrote was about a coffee grower caught up in the Civil War, the terrible war, in Yemen, which actually is not so much a civil war as one of the outside intervention by big powers.</p><p>EGGERS: Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR: And I just, you know, keep thinking also about the previous one you wrote, \"The Circle,\" which was such a huge bestseller, which was, you know, ahead of its time warning about a sort of Google like campus and the whole sort of intrusion into people's privacy and how this technology and A.I. can start to control the environment and control human behavior. Explain what you're seeing and where you try to examine the interface between humans and their environment.</p><p>EGGERS: Well, I'm also interested in the workers who individually think that they might be doing good, who are unaware of the larger design, and that was definitely the case in \"The Circle.\" Individually, each one of those people working at this, you know, presumably idealistic tech campus think that they are improving him an idea and connecting people but they don't realize that the larger design is, you know, surveillance, capitalism and sort of an effort to, you know, create a monopoly, to aggregate power and wealth through, you know, one narrow technological conduit.</p><p>And so, in all of those cases, yes, I'm interested in the people that are part of the machinery and really feel like day-to-day that they are helping but sometimes they don't -- they aren't aware of either the unintended consequences or the consequences that have been preordained or planned but without their --</p><p>AMANPOUR: Yes.</p><p>EGGERS: -- knowledge.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean I wonder whether you even imagined that after you had written \"The Circle\" and after it was such a best seller, all this has come out about all the tech companies and whatever Facebook, Google, all of the sort of machinations that are going on.</p><p>And then people are really worried about what this is going to do to the species, to addiction, to as you say monopolies and control.</p><p>I wonder whether you had imagined that it would come true and I guess as a corollary to that, would you support democratic presidential candidates Senator Elizabeth Warren who said she will want to break up these big tech monopolies.</p><p>EGGERS: Yes, I support what she's saying, absolutely. I think it's -- they are monopolies and they're acting in a monopolistic way. And so, we have laws that are meant -- anti-trust laws that are meant to combat that because it's not good a democratic society and it's not good for a capitalist society.</p><p>And so, I do support her in that. And I thought it was very bold of her to propose it. It has to be part of the 2020 conversation. And I had a dim view of this went I wrote the book five years ago. I thought things were trending one way. They have gotten far worse.</p><p>But the one thing I'm gratified by or encouraged by is that when I wrote it, most people were still trusting I think of the motivations and business practices of a lot of these -- the larger tech companies. And right now, I think most people are highly suspicious and highly wary and very open to more regulation and examination--</p><p>AMANPOUR: Right. You--</p><p>EGGERS: That's at least gratifying.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, and last year you came back to this topic. You did a lecture in which you called for sort of a digital human rights. And you have said and spoken a lot about it.</p><p>Here you said talking about the complicity here, \"digital tools generally degrade us, specifically they make us in to needy maniacs, and the tech companies that we distrust act no better and no worse than we ourselves act with these tools.</p><p>Our complicity in the rise of these companies and in their increasing power is impossible to avoid or deny. Every bit of power these companies have is power that we have given them.\"</p><p>So, basically you are there saying that it's not the smart phone or Apple or Zuckerberg that's involved, it's us who involved. Is that what you're saying?</p><p>EGGERS: Well the odd thing is, is that we don't have to use Facebook. There are no laws that require us to use a platform that we inherently distrust and has been proven again and again to abuse and to have distained for the privacy of all of its users.</p><p>And so, there are so many ways to connect with each other online and share photos and all these other things that we want to do. These wonderful things that we can do without having to empower a very bad actor.</p><p>And so, and that's what's funny to -- and frustrating I guess is that all this power, all this wealth, the aggregation of so much data, it's all data that we have given them for the most part. And so, we do have choices. Consumers really have power.</p><p>And I feel like if collectively we said well, this company, Facebook I think is the worst actor of all of them. If we said we no longer trust you, we're not going to participate in your plan. We're opting out. And we're going to a platform like Neewee (ph) which is a nonprofit version of Facebook.</p><p>AMANPOUR: I mean it strikes me as pretty gulling when I have read now in retrospect that a lot of the great geniuses, the great innovators of this tech and of these devices we're told didn't even allow their own children to use them until a certain age.</p><p>And here now we're talking about the responsibility of citizens. But citizens who have become addicted, I mean this is lie being on a drug. How do you get off it?</p><p>EGGERS: Yes. I can't count the number of tech inventors and innovators and very powerful people who send their kids to (inaudible) schools, which ban all technology at school and in the home.</p><p>And so they know something that a lot of users don't know, which is the highly addictive and (inaudible) sort of consequences of these tools, especially in the hands of very young kids. They know best.</p><p>And I think that so many parents feel like they have to give their kids devices at a young age to keep them up with societal expectations or educational demands. And this just isn't the case. Sometimes these tools are way too powerful to be given to very young kids.</p><p>And I think that we just have to examine that as parents, as educators, schools, everybody really has to slow down a bit and say really what's best for the development of young minds and can we just sort of not channel all of our kids education through screens.</p><p>AMANPOUR: One of the most adapt users of social media in all of this is the president of the United States. I mean he is a real master of this art. You have followed him for awhile. I mean you've been to rallies in Texas and the rest. And you've come about -- come away with some really interesting observations. Notably perhaps that you know, Donald Trump could win again.</p><p>You write, we in the media have long seen Trump as a racist buffoon and a threat but his supporters see him as a man who gets things done, who speaks candidly, who's engineered an economic boom, the envy of the world, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Just give me some, you know, eye witness accounts of your reporting to what makes you lead to your conclusion.</p><p>EGGERS: I'm here in San Francisco. We're in a bubble and we make certain assumptions including that he's very vulnerable and will be relatively easy to beat in 2020. Then I went to that rally in El Paso where he rallied on one side of the street and Beto O'Rourke was on the other.</p><p>And I was shocked to see over the course of the day about 17,000 people line up to go to his rally. Across the street may three, 4,000 people that go to Beto O'Rourke's rally. And the people at the Trump rally were a very diverse audience. El Paso is a very diverse city.</p><p>You know about 80 percent Latino and -- and it was reflected in the audience. And I interviewed so many people who were so just rational in their support and why they supported him and they ignore so much of the tweeting and so much of the madness that we see in the president's behavior because the economic results over the last few years they value and they see their 401k going up.</p><p>They see employment opportunities available. They see relatives who are in the military coming home. They see all these sort of practical effects of the president's policies and they're -- they're giving him a real -- he's - - it makes him formidable for 2020.</p><p>So I came away thinking, all right, it's important to go out and actually interview people and not make assumptions or not get your information third hand from a couch in San Francisco.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Exactly. Well -- well -- well put.</p><p>EGGERS: So I think he'll be hard to beat.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well put. Dave Eggers, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>EGGERS: Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Now, where were you when man first stepped on the moon? Everybody who watched has their own searing memory and they're own story. Neil Armstrong setting foot out there and declaring, \"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" is the stuff movies and dreams are made of.</p><p>But this very real heroic feat is the subject of a new documentary. Showing us that moment 50 years ago, this July in a whole new light. And here's a clip from the trailer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole Apollo Program was designed to get two Americans to the lunar surface and back again to earth safely. The enormity of this event is something that only history will be able to judge.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Todd Douglas Miller is the director of Apollo 11. He's been speaking with our Hari Sreenivasan about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CNNI HOST: You know never before seen footage is often used as a marketing gimmick. But in this case it completely changed the composition of your film.</p><p>TODD DOUGLAS MILLER, DIRECTOR OF APOLLO 11: Yes, I mean initially -- and this was the tail end of 2016, we cast a very wide net within the spider web network of NASA facilities and also the National Archives.</p><p>And three or four months into the project we get this email from the National Archives, our contact there, our archivist (ph) who said that they had -- had this collection of large format material that was previously, you know, uncataloged.</p><p>They didn't really know exactly what was on it. They had -- it did have written on some of the reels, Apollo 11. Some of the dates ended around the launch, which was July 16th of 1969. So that began the process of discovering exactly what these were.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: How much footage are we talking about?</p><p>MILLER: So hundreds of reels. And it just wasn't in National Archives. We also had access to another 100 reels of engineering 70 millimeter footage. So that's all the great slow motion, you know, rocket -- of the rocket taking off. We had a ton of that stuff to go through. And then if that wasn't enough, we were also alerted to over 11,000 hours of mission control audio that was uncovered by NASA.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: How do you get 11,000 hours? I mean, what is - what are they recording for that long?</p><p>MILLER: So it was really unique. It was one inch tape. If you could imagine, if you're sitting in mission control, you have 30 flight controllers. Each one of those guys that's on a headset is recorded on a track in the back.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: So really, every word that was uttered in mission control had been recorded and sitting, gathering dust?</p><p>MILLER: Yes, and not only that. The backroom, each flight controller had an entire backroom full of other light controllers. So they were all on loops. So it was really, in essence, about 60 tracks that all needed to be synched up.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: But why take this on? I mean, at this point, we probably have a memory of seeing that black and white footage. Why - why do this as a film?</p><p>MILLER: You know, it really started as an editing exercise, you know, with my archive producer Stephen Slater who's based in the U.K. He had been synching up a lot of mission control footage with audio because when they originally shot it, it didn't have any sound on it.</p><p>So, you know, it gets addictive, you know, to try to figure out what these guys are saying at what times because they really shot it with no regard for if, you know, there was going to be any audio. They were just kind of getting beauty shots of these guys working and documenting them for historical purposes.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: And once the large format stuff came into our purview, it felt like, you know, it - we were all, you know, wanting to work on something like this. So we were kind of - it was the perfect team for this to land on.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: So you find all this video - film and you find all this audio. What do you learn about this?</p><p>MILLER: We learned a lot. I mean, probably the greatest part of working on the project was working very closely with NASA's chief historian, Bill Barry, and his team, obviously, the National Archives as well, and then the families and Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Neil Armstrong's sons, Rick and Mark, they were one of the first people that we showed this footage to before we even started the process of -</p><p>SREENIVASAN: What'd they think?</p><p>MILLER: I mean, they were floored like everyone else. You know, just when you thought you'd seen it all, and particularly for them. I mean, they - you know, they were so gracious with their time in helping us out to, you know, really get the accuracy of not only the mission but also just the spirit of who their fathers were and the people that worked with them.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: But what is it about this moment, I mean - which might not happen ever again, maybe until we set foot on Mars or the aliens come down and talk to us? It almost seemed to unite the entire planet.</p><p>MILLER: Yes. It was not lost on us at any time. I can speak for the entire team. It was just such a unique experience to - to witness the sheer scope of this. You know, you put yourself back in the `60s and with JFK in this charge to the country to try to drum up support for the space program, which is very expensive to send someone to another planet or another world.</p><p>And all the political strife that was going on, you know, JFK himself, a year after his - his speech in Texas, is assassinated in Texas. His brother is assassinated. Dr. Martin Luther King is assassinated. You have the background of the Vietnam War, but throughout all of that, you have hundreds of thousands of people that are spread across tens of thousands of companies that all came together to accomplish this one goal of putting a human on another world. And it was - it's just miraculous.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: And you've got a clip of that that I want to show as well. It starts with just kind of a long shot of how many people. It's dizzying, even to think about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're past the six-minute mark in our countdown for Apollo 11. Now, five minutes 52 seconds and counting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible). Verify go for launch.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upward. The vehicle weighs close to 6.5 million pounds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN: That is a lot of people, and that's just a clip from the film to illustrate your point. You know, one of the things that I remembered and I think most people nowadays, if - when they go to your film, what they'll see is - well, the first shots you had of mission control, it was almost like it was a uniform. It was all white shirts, half-sleeve, with a tie, and almost all men. There was one woman in the room that really caught - I was like, \"Wait a minute. What's her story?\"</p><p>MILLER: Yes. I mean, that's the beauty of really doing the research and going deep into the archive with the entire Apollo program. There is one woman, her name is JoAnn Morgan.</p><p>Apollo 11 was the first time that she actually was in the firing room which was the launch control center which was adjacent to the pad down in Florida what was called Cape Kennedy at the time now, today Cape Canaveral. And before the Saturn V rocket launched, she was just an amazing engineer.</p><p>She was there on her own credentials, didn't matter that she was a female. And she ended up having a very long history with NASA. Worked there for 43 years, retired and is still alive today. And it just wasn't her. We had unfortunately and hopefully this ends up on like a Blu-ray or DVD.</p><p>There was a 25 year old (inaudible) that was in the back room in mission control. Her name was Poppy Northcutt; she actually on Apollo 13 was in the front room. But there's a moment after lunar liftoff when they're arguing -- the flight controllers in the front room are arguing over flight trajectories.</p><p>So they consult with the back room. Poppy comes on, and basically just schools these guys in some math. And while their numbers are off and she's trying to articulate why they're wrong.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: And it takes about five minutes for her to finally get through to these guys. But it just highlights the great effort of all, just not male, female, minorities across all races to put this thing together.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: One thing that surprised me was relatively speaking how advance the technology in some way was. They were getting near real-time heart beats of these astronauts. And I had no idea that in 1969 we had the tech and then afterwards I was stunned by how low and how cool they are.</p><p>MILLER: Yes, I mean sometimes I have a tough time calling my sister back in Ohio. So, it's just a testament to the technological advances that the Apollo program did. Certainly, if you listen to the air to ground transmissions, it's scratchy most of th time. It's tough stuff to get through.</p><p>But they did it. And they developed ways to communicate. And that was just one of dozens of new technologies that were invented to put someone on the surface of the moon.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: At one point, at the takeoff I think, Buzz Aldrin's heart beat is around 88. And then on the other end of the spectrum, Neil Armstrong's heart beat when he's about to land the thing is what, 100--</p><p>MILLER: 155.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: That is me on a treadmill at a good run, right? I mean that's really exerting ourselves. And here he is, the stress of that moment, you could see it was in his heart right there.</p><p>MILLER: Yes, but when you listen to Neil Armstrong's (inaudible) as they're landing, it never waivers. So, he might've been stressing on the inside, but on the outside and it goes for all of the mission controllers during that moment. Charley Duke famously says, \"Copy Eagle, you got a bunch of guys ready to turn blue here. We're breathing again.\"</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Yes.</p><p>MILLER: And it just goes to show kind of the nerves of steel. And you have to remember, Buzz and Neil both were Korean War veterans. They flew missions, dozens and dozens of combat missions. Buzz himself shot down a mig (ph) and then pulled out a camera and photographed the pilot ejecting.</p><p>These guys had been hardened veterans of not only war but they were test pilots. And unlike some of their predecessors in the space program, they were educated. Neil had a degree in aeronautics. Buzz went to MIT. And they -- his nickname was Dr. Randevu.</p><p>Michael Collins was a graduate at West Point and ended up in the air force. So, these guys had been around the block. And it's no -- now you know why they were chosen to go about this extraordinary mission.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: And there was flying required back then. I mean the -- we kind of take it for granted now. But to get these things to connect and disconnect and really ultimately landing of where the module landed was by hand.</p><p>MILLER: Yes. I mean, Neil Armstrong certainly they had very archaic computers compared to now. But to get them to a certain altitude and then Neil actually -- Neil Armstrong himself guided the lunar lander down to the surface of the moon.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Going through all this footage, what surprised you?</p><p>MILLER: I think if you see the suiting up shots that was the most surprising for me. I had seen those images a lot over the decades. But I had never seen them like that. And just opposed (ph) a real that came shortly after we had that real which from the day of the launch, the morning of the launch. They're getting suited up to go on this amazing thing -- journey.</p><p>There was -- they were doing the same thing a few days before on a dry run. And they were kind of slapping themselves on the back. A bit jovial. You know they did the same thing. They went into the astrovan, drove out to the pad, got in the elevator, went -- sat on top of the rocket, came back down and went home.</p><p>But on the day of the launch, you just see this look on their faces. There was no joking and you could just see the weight of what they were about to do written all over it. And it just really snapped into focus, I think for all of us.</p><p>Their responsibility that they had to do that and also, you know in a very small way, our responsibility, you know to the imagery that we were luckily enough to be granted to work with.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: I didn't realize one of the first things that happened on the moon was to set up a camera. I mean just like well there's scientific gear, et cetera, et cetera. Actually he sets up the camera and you can see all of these shots of Buzz Aldrin coming down.</p><p>I mean it was just -- there's certainly forethought put in to what they should do and how it should be documented for the entire world to see.</p><p>MILLER: Yes, the training was immense. They -- you know they rehearsed down to the second exactly all the moves, choreographed. One of the kind of humorous things was when they landed they were actually supposed to sleep. They were supposed to have a sleep period.</p><p>But of course you land on the moon and I don't think anybody's going -- anybody's going to go to bed. So they requested if they could, you know, perform their lunar excursion activities, the EVA first. They were granted that.</p><p>And some of that imagery that we saw, you know at first, quite frankly the engineers at Goldstone, California weren't ready for it. So that's why the image is flipped upside down. There wasn't -- you know originally it was supposed to go to Australia and just the way that signal was, you know, sent to the earth it ended up at California.</p><p>So, you know, luckily we do have that imagery and lucky, you know, for me as a film maker, Buzz Aldrin documented with a 16 millimeter camera looking right down the barrel of the later, Neil's first steps.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Just suppose that capsule with what just happened a little awhile ago, SpaceX sending a capsule up, I mean you look around and every shot Buzz Aldrin -- the Armstrong, there's just switches and gear and buttons and lights everywhere. And now it's this clean white wall, two LED screens.</p><p>I mean it's amazing that these three humans had to know how to work all of that manually.</p><p>MILLER: What we've accomplished in 50 years, you know on the technology front, I think is -- is truly amazing and I'm -- I'm actually encouraged that you know companies like SpaceX working with NASA and all the great, you know, space programs all around the world, it's a very exciting time for the future of space travel because we're going to have to get out there, you know, at some point.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Why doesn't the government undertake anything like this? Could it? Should it? Is it going to be replaced by private companies and is that the right way to get going in space?</p><p>MILLER: I could speak to the historical context, which is -- you know John F. Kennedy made a charge to the country and -- and -- and went out and actually sold this. So there was a political will that was established to make this happen. Our legacy of Apollo, I think should be followed up. It's inevitable.</p><p>You know we're -- as we grow as a population worldwide where we need, you know, new places to go. Whether it happens, you know, a hundred years from now, a thousand, a million; it's going to happen.</p><p>And Apollo 11 serves as a -- the entire program serves as a -- as a primer for us to -- to get back out there.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Is that what you want people to take away from the film?</p><p>MILLER: I think so but also just to be reminded that over the decades and as time has evolved, you know we -- we kind of get into our boxes, if you will, and events like this bring us together. They unite us and they certainly did back then and they certainly can do again.</p><p>SREENIVASAN: Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MILLER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>AMANPOUR: Well, I for one can never get enough of Apollo 11 and I'm going to be running, not walking to go and see this film. And as Hari said in a sign of just how much private industry has taken over the space program, SpaceX just fully tested its dragon capsule, sending it to the international space station and then back to earth.</p><p>The company hopes the capsule will soon carry human astronauts, which would indeed be a landmark achievement for a private enterprise. And that is it for now. Remember you can always listen to our podcast. You can see us online at amanpour.com and you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.

David Beasley, head of the U.N.World Food Program joins us from the capital, Addis Ababa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, it's the second Boeing crash in 5 months.  Should passengers be nervous?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the complicated morality of international development in war-torn countries.  I speak with the novelist, Dave Eggers, about his new book, \"The Parade.\"</p><p>Plus, this isn't Hollywood CGI.  Director of the stunning new documentary, \"Apollo 11,\" Todd Douglas Miller, sits down with our Hari Sreenivasan.</p><p>Welcome to the program, everyone.  I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.</p><p>Just six minutes after takeoff, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed into the ground and killed all 157 people on board.  Bound for Nairobi, Kenya, its passengers hailed from at least 35 different countries.  Investigators now have the black box and they're looking into similarities with an Indonesian plane crash last October, that was the same Boeing model as this airliner, and we'll have more on that in a moment.</p><p>But first, among those killed in Sunday's crash were 21 employees of the United Nations.  The route is so frequented by them that it's been dubbed the U.N. shuffle and some of them were headed to an environmental summit in Nairobi where colleagues today held this moment of silence in their honor.</p><p>Seven of the dead worked for the World Food Program, the U.N. agency tasked with feeding the world's most desperate people.  Its chief is David Beasley, he's the former governor of South Carolina and he flew to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.  And moments before we spoke, he had received a phone call from Vice President Mike Pence expressing his condolences on behalf of President Trump and the American people.</p><p>Governor Beasley, welcome to the program.  And we just want to offer us sincere condolences.  The U.N. has lost so many people.</p><p>What is it like for you as one of the U.N. chiefs to be out there processing and probably repatriating victims?</p><p>DAVID BEASLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME:  Christiane, it's devastating, it's heartbreaking.  You know, we lose people out on the field, the of battle fields, natural disasters almost every single day but we don't expect something like this.  And, you know, the U.N. system, we've lost over 20 people, at the World Food Program we lost seven, it's just devastating.  But I'm here down in Ethiopia and Addis Ababa meeting with our staff and it is really just so, so sad.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  How are they dealing with it?  Because it is just a catastrophe for all of you to have lost so many people doing such hard work in so many difficult places in the world.  How are your staff dealing with it?</p><p>BEASLEY:  Well, you know, our staff, they're tough.  All over the world, they're dealing with war and tragedies and devastation and hunger and poverty.  But this hits home in such a way that you just can't imagine when seven of your friends, your brothers, your sisters, your colleagues, go down in a crash like this, it's an irony because we don't expect this to happen.</p><p>And today, as I was meeting with our staff, hundreds together here in Addis Ababa, there wasn't a dry eye, there were tears drops and weeping and then hugging and it's just hard to believe.</p><p>And so, our people are putting their lives on the line every day for others.  But today, they were coming together to really try to comfort one another.  And I'll tell you, the support that we've been receiving from all over the world is truly been remarkable, even from the prime minister here in Ethiopia.  I met with him today and president and other leaders that are calling in, it's been a remarkable, the amount of comfort that we're getting from leaders all over the world.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Governor Beasley, you tweeted that in Addis Ababa today in solidarity with the prime minister mourning the lives lost yesterday and pledging our full support together for the families, our hearts are broken at the loss.  What can you do?  Why have you flown from headquarters in Rome there?  What's the best you can do under the circumstances right now?</p><p>BEASLEY:  You know, yesterday when I got this first phone call, you can imagine it's probably one of the darkest days of my life.  And then the secretary general of the United Nations called, another started calling and immediately, we said, \"What can we do?\"  Words can only go so far.  And so, we jumped on a plane and headed down to Ethiopia to be here where the accident took place, where the deficit tool place to comfort those.</p><p>And I think, you know, words can only do so much.  But I think just being here with the friends, being here with the team and our teams in Rome as well because we lost colleagues that operate out of their own headquarters.</p><p>But, Christiane, I'm -- I want to say this because the World Food Programme, we were just one of the many organizations that lost some brave, brave individuals.  And somebody asked me earlier, he said, \"What were these people like?\"  And I said, you know, \"One way there were just average people.  Truly trying to make the world a better place.  But the other side, they're my superheroes.  They lay their lives down every day.\"</p><p>And so, to come down here to just be with them, to hug with them, I don't know what else we could do other just let them know we love them.  And honestly, I think every one of those brave souls that died on that plane, they would want every one of our people to continue on because we're on a campaign to end hunger around the world, we're on the campaign to help people all over the world, and I don't think they want to stop doing.</p><p>And so, we want to continue that spirit, that kindred spirit of loving our neighbor, taking care of one another, being brothers and sisters to one another.  So, it's a tough time but we'll get through it.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Governor, you rightly said that there are U.N. workers from other agencies there.  There's yours, the World Food Programme, who are really helping feed the starving around the world and the hungry around the world in warzones, there are people who were associated with the High Commission for Refugees, there are people who were in the Migration Department to the U.N.</p><p>And as you said, I just want to spotlight, one of them was Mick Ryan who is the global deputy chief engineer for World Food Programme.  He is an Irish citizen.  And we have some video of him when he was in Bangladesh trying to set up the refugee camp for the desperately needed Rohingyas.  And the prime minister of Ireland has tweeted, \"Our thoughts are with families of those lost in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, including the Irish engineer, Michael Ryan.  Michael was doing life changing work in Africa with the World Food Programme.  Deepest sympathies to family, colleagues and friends.\"</p><p>So, this really touches every nation.  Can -- do you remember Michael?  What do you remember about Michael's work?</p><p>BEASLEY:  Well, you know, Mick as we call him.  He was an engineer and we had legit logisticians and accountants and you name it, every walk of life.  And Mick was amazing.  And I can honestly say, because I've been at Cox's Bazar, which has been some of the most difficult places in the world and the most -- I mean, people literally would be dead right now if it weren't for people like Mick who go there and take their expertise and put their lives on the line like he did and others, like Maria and (INAUDIBLE), I can go on and on.</p><p>Mick represented the best of the best.  But in my opinion, he is The World Food Programme.  Men and women like Mick, every day putting their lives literally on the line.  And this is what -- not just the World Food Programme but UNACR and other agencies that are out there doing this every single day.</p><p>And we lose almost a person every single day out there, whether it's a war zone or conflict or natural disaster or kidnappings or whatever the case may be.  And so, we're used to tragedy but this comes in an ironic -- this comes in a way there's a little bit of irony to it as we would say.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, how do you think the work of the organization as a whole, the U.N., will be impacted by the sudden loss of these people?</p><p>BEASLEY:  I think the mood of the World Food Programme, the United Nations, its solidarity.  It brings everybody together.  What this tragedy has done has brought us together with a spirit that I think will rekindle our fire to go out there and continue to fight for people all over the world, to do what's right, to do what's good no matter the circumstances, no matter where, no matter how far.  That's the World Food Programme, and that's the commitment of the humanitarians.</p><p>And so, I don't think it'll dampen our spirit.  I think, in fact, it will bring us together in such a way that it will rekindle our spirit to do even more.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Governor David Beasley, thank you for being with us.  Head of the World Food Programme on this very, very difficult day.</p><p>BEASLEY:  Thank you, Christiane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  A real tragedy for the U.N. workers and the families of 157 people who were killed when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 went down.  It was a new plane, a Boeing model known as the 737 MAX 8.  And that's important because it's the same model as an Indonesian plane that crashed in October, also just minutes after takeoff.  So, should passengers on these jets be worried?</p><p>Mary Schiavo is former inspector general of the Department of Transportation in the United States and she's joining me now from South Carolina.  She's also a lawyer who represents crash victims and has current litigation pending against Boeing.</p><p>Mary Schiavo, welcome to the program.</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, FORMER INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT:  Thank you.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, you can imagine everybody around the world is focused on this because of not only the tragedy but because it bears so many similarities to what happened in Indonesia five months ago.  What went through your mind when you heard that this model went down in Ethiopia?</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Oh, no, not again.  And I think that's what's going through the mind of passengers around the world and airlines around the world.  And it's the uncertainty that so problematic and that's why passengers are worried and the internet is literally lighting up with people saying, \"How can I find out if I'm booked on this model of airplane?\"</p><p>So, the worry is real and it will not subside until they download the data from the black boxes, which they got today.  And I think they'll have answers very soon.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Obviously, you know, experts and professionals have to get the evidence before you can start speculating.  But we did have and we have a soundbite of an eyewitness from the ground who actually saw what happened as the plane came down.  Let's just listen to this and see if it matches with some of the thoughts we may have about the crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GADISA BENTI, WITNESSED ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH (through translator):  When it was hovering, fire was coming from its tail, then it tried to lift its nose.  But when it couldn't, it was leaning side to side.  And finally, when it passed over our house, the nose pointed down and the tail raised up.  It went straight into the ground with its nose.  It then exploded.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, it's quite descriptive.  He's quite careful, this gentleman, about what he's saying.  And I don't know, Mary, whether you found this important, but he said when it was hovering, fire was --</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- coming out of its tail.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  That's extremely important now.  Air crash investigators often are, you know, a suspect of eyewitness and ear witness reports because sometimes there are problems with what they report and what happened.  But here, this is inconsistent with a problem with the flight controls, a problem with the -- for example, like in Lion Air, it was the angle of tach indicator, here the initial thoughts were the airspeed indicator.</p><p>If in fact, there were flames coming from the aircraft and if in fact, there was smoke and it was a experiencing this problem because of a smoke and flame incident, then that doesn't at all sound like Lion Air.  But up until the point of this, it did sound like Lion Air, same point in flight, same airspeed, same part of the flight on takeoff, pilot reports a problem and is heading back to the airport, those are all so very similar to Lion Air.</p><p>But if this eyewitness is correct, this is hugely important, it changes the way people will look at this, if it's borne out on the black boxes and the cockpit voice recording.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Again, what you've just said is very significant, we have to wait for the actual voice recordings and the other data on those black boxes.</p><p>But is this model, based on what's just happened with these two crashes, is it particularly susceptible to malfunction?</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Well, I think two instances of a malfunction on a brand-new plane takes it past the thought of those as susceptible, it's been shown.  Because in a new model aircraft, ordinarily what newer models do is they bring better safety statistics.  To have two fatal whole losses in less than six months means that you've got a problem.  Maybe it's not the same problem on each flight but, absolutely, Boeing will have to go back, they will have to go back to engineering, not just correcting the flight manuals, not just saying pilots need additional training.</p><p>If this is yet another problem on this model, they're going to have to go back and ask their engineers and literally, take it back to when they decided to make these changes on the plane because the changes stemmed from changing the engines.</p><p>The 737 has been around since 1967 and it's a workhorse.  But something, if this is now a second and different problem yet to boot, that only, I think, raises more concerns about what they need to do and they did go back to engineering.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let me just ask you about Boeing and what it said in the immediate aftermath of this, that they are not issuing new guidance.  Does that surprise you?  Here's the statement that they are saying, \"Safety is our number one priority.  The investigation is in its early stages.  But at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.\"  Is that -- I mean, is that right or should they be more cautious even now?</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Well, to me, that suggests two things.  First and foremost, they don't know.  So, whatever information they have so far, be it messages from the plane, the ACARS systems were functional, whatever information they have, it doesn't seem to fit with something that they already know about the airplane.  So, they can issue new guidance.</p><p>I really don't doubt that if Boeing had an idea that, \"Oh, my gosh.  Lion Air has happened again and these pilots are not -- you know, they haven't had the training or this hasn't fixed the problem,\" I can believe that they would not issue immediate guidance.  But to me that suggests that they know it's not the same, something else is wrong here and we have to figure out what this is, and that's very, you know, disconcerting but, obviously, they wouldn't want to issue the wrong guidance and have them do something that causes even more difficulties, maybe even another loss of a plane.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Again, you're saying it may not be the same and you said that after heard this eyewitness talking about the flames.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Yes.  And there was one mention yesterday of someone who said smoke.  So, this would be the second mention.  But this makes it very different from Lion Air if that's correct.  And I go back to TWA 800, it happened way back in 1996.  And there, dozen, scores of witnesses swore that they saw a missile strike the plane.  A missile did not strike the plane.  The center fuel tank exploded.</p><p>So, eyewitnesses can sometimes see things that look differently and perhaps, it could have been fire and smoke from the explosion.  I don't know.  No one knows at this point.  But if this is true and it was on fire in the sky, this is a totally different scenario than Lion Air.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  All right.  So, let's just park that for a moment and wait until we know much more evidence.  However, given the fact that this has now happened twice, for whatever reasons, do you think those in charge, whatever authorities they are, whether it's the FAA in the United States, whether it's the Europeans counterpart over here, should they be grounding the planes?  I know we've already said Boeing is not issuing new guidance.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Right.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  But should others?  Because as we know, China, Indonesia, Ethiopia and I think the Cayman Islands have all grounded these planes.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Right.  Well, I think they should because there's just too much unknown here.  Until they know what happened, obviously, this is terribly alarming for passengers, for pilots, for operators.  Until you know what has happened, it's just this very, you know, scary situation where you have two planes that have fallen from the sky and they're brand-new planes, that just doesn't happen statistically speaking.  So, I think that a grounding is in order.</p><p>The way that it often works, for example, with the Federal Aviation Administration of the United States of America, they don't do it until they have more evidence.  For example, on the 787 that had the lithium ion battery problem, they had several instances before they took action.  On the grounding of the Douglas Aircraft 10 way back in the 70s, it took many weeks before that was grounded.  And really, a public outcry.</p><p>So, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration really is reticent to do that and they require a lot of evidence.  And in this case, they're following the rest of the world, which is unfortunate, but I do think until they figure out what happened here, they should be grounded, but that doesn't mean that the FAA will do that without more evidence, they usually don't.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean, China, obviously, has a lot of these planes.  I mean, that's a lot of planes to ground.  And clearly, that would have a big business impact on Boeing.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Right.  And that's what's so interesting about who has grounded the planes.  For example, Lion Air that last one in October, they have, I think, 25 of these.  This is a large part of their fleet, but they're grounded there.  And for an airline like Southwest, which has a great number.  Southwest has a huge number of 740 or 737 and you would think that that wouldn't be such a big impact on their schedule.</p><p>So, for some of the countries and airlines that have grounded them, that is a huge part of their fleet and they have made a huge commitment, which to me says that they are concerned and rightly so I think.  So, yes, I mean, I think on Boeing, this is -- has a tremendous impact, which is why I have just got to believe that they don't think it is the same thing.  Because if it was, I would have thought they would have issued immediate guidance and said, \"Get those pilots trained and, you know, let's get this under control,\" and they haven't done that.  So, that, to me, says they don't know yet.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, Mary Schiavo, what does that mean, get those pilots trained?  I mean, what is so different about this plane?  I realize that there are differences.  But on the other hand -- well, just on the other hand, 4,500 or so have been purchased, they're the biggest and best selling of the Boeing models, I think in Boeing's history, they have a fuel efficiency capacity.</p><p>SCHIAVO:  You have hit it exactly on the head.  I think this is a watershed event.  I think this is one of those sea chains in aviation.  Because now, we have an aircraft that says, \"You pilot, we're not even going to tell you about this.\"  Before Lion Air, they weren't told, \"We're going to program this plane so it overrides the pilot.\"  We're not talking about a drone aircraft here, we're talking about a 737 and we put our trust in the hands of the pilots.</p><p>And we expect them to be able to fly the plane, I mean, take it off of autopilot, take off the commands and put your hands on the yoke or the stick and the rudder and do it in an emergency.  And this model now says, No, we didn't think it was necessary before Lion Air even to tell you and the plane will override you.\"  We've entered a new era of aviation where the pilot, (INAUDIBLE) says what this is saying to me, might be secondary in the future and this is probably the crossroads.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, this is a really important moment in that case because everybody, as you say --</p><p>SCHIAVO:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  -- has it safe in the pilot's ability to override the automations when necessary.  Mary Schiavo, thank you very much indeed.  We're no doubt going to be hearing a lot more, obviously, about this in the coming days.</p><p>Now, overall, air travel remains the safest way to go, it is remarkably safe and an extraordinary feat of engineering.  And in a moment, we get a look at what might be humankind's most impressive engineering marvel, which was landing on the moon.  It is the subject of an incredible new documentary.</p><p>But first, the novelist, Dave Eggers, has gained a reputation for chronicling the most important societal upheavals of our time, whether the rise of Silicon Valley or the power of Middle East oil states or Hurricane Katrina.</p><p>His latest book takes on a different moral ambiguity, what happens when foreigners drop in to work and help in developing countries which are ravaged by war.  This novel set in just such an unnamed country is the parade.  And of course, it comes as our conversation comes right in the wake of this crash.  Eggers tells me that it was inspired by some real-world personal experiences.</p><p>Dave Eggers, welcome to the program.</p><p>DAVE EGGERS, AUTHOR, \"THE PARADE\":  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let's talk about your latest book.  And it's actually a continuation almost of some of the books you've written, which you look like a sort of exploration around the world.  This one is really interesting, short but it's about two contractors who are building a road to connect a rural south to an urban north after a war and there's meant to be a parade to celebrate the completion of this road, but it doesn't all go to plan.  Give us the sort of bones of the story without being a spoiler.</p><p>EGGERS:  Well, these are two workers.  They're just pavers, they're contractors that are doing the work as the same way they would anywhere in the world, they drop in without passports, without known identities and they're there to do a job but they take drastically different views on their work and they approach it differently.  One just wants to do the work and go home and get the job done and his a veteran of this kind of work, and the other sees it as an adventure and an invitation to engage deeply in the local culture.  But both approaches are fraught and have their own complications.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, interestingly, you know, you don't name them.  Certainly, you don't name what country they come from but you don't actually give them names, they're called Nine and Four.</p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I -- you know, I wanted them to be nameless and countryless because I think, at least, here in the U.S. we assume that characters like this are representative of American adventurers or interventions abroad.  And this kind of work is not at all exclusive to the U.S.  And particularly, right now, all over the world and in particular in Africa, the Chinese are doing all kinds of road building, port building, railway building.</p><p>And so -- and, you know, years ago in South Sudan, I saw a Swedish team building a road in rural South Sudan and I thought it's -- I was interested in what the Swedish team parachuted into rural South Sudan was thinking and what was -- what did they gather or ruminate on in terms of the implications of their work and sort of where they were, did they know the history, did they know the impact and the possible consequences of that work.</p><p>And so, I wanted them to be kind of nameless because you could insert any sort of industrialized country into sort of the work of these two guys.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  So, let me just -- let me dig down into that.  Because I do find it interesting that you are posing that question about what is the ethics, what is the morality of intervention, even when it looks like intervention to help.</p><p>And, you know, the -- one of the reviews said that, \"Eggers ably weaves in a host of ethical questions, over one man's responsibility to the other, what makes help transactional versus simply kind and whether the road, in this case itself, will truly bring safety and progress to the provinces at 70 miles an hour.  And Eggers is determined to counter the notion that social and economic improvement work hand in hand.\"  Do you agree with that?</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.  That's well said.  I hadn't seen that.  I -- yes.  You know, I don't think that -- I want to make it clear that neither one of these men is at fault.  There isn't a villain, at least, immediately apparent here.  And really, they are such small players in a game that's just -- that they are, again, replaceable in, they are just tools used by -- in a machine that, you know, is far larger than just their work and just their job.</p><p>But within that, you see these two different approaches, where one man says, \"It's not for us to intervene, to help, to aid in any way with the people along the roadside that might need our help.  We are there to do one job and leave.\"  So, he, who is called Four, is just actually not even looking left and right, he's looking straight down to the finish line, the end of their work.</p><p>And Nine sees it as a way, you know, \"We have things that these people might need.  I have a duty to intervene where there -- where I might be able to help.\"  And he's incredibly naive but it comes from an inherent sort of openness and goodness almost.  But both approaches have some deleterious consequences.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Right.</p><p>EGGERS:  And, of course, their work in the end, collectively, has consequences far beyond what they saw.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.  I can see you struggling over not wanting to do a spoiler on your own.</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  On your own book.  Look, the last book you wrote was about a coffee grower caught up in the Civil War, the terrible war, in Yemen, which actually is not so much a civil war as one of the outside intervention by big powers.</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  And I just, you know, keep thinking also about the previous one you wrote, \"The Circle,\" which was such a huge bestseller, which was, you know, ahead of its time warning about a sort of Google like campus and the whole sort of intrusion into people's privacy and how this technology and A.I. can start to control the environment and control human behavior.  Explain what you're seeing and where you try to examine the interface between humans and their environment.</p><p>EGGERS:  Well, I'm also interested in the workers who individually think that they might be doing good, who are unaware of the larger design, and that was definitely the case in \"The Circle.\"  Individually, each one of those people working at this, you know, presumably idealistic tech campus think that they are improving him an idea and connecting people but they don't realize that the larger design is, you know, surveillance, capitalism and sort of an effort to, you know, create a monopoly, to aggregate power and wealth through, you know, one narrow technological conduit.</p><p>And so, in all of those cases, yes, I'm interested in the people that are part of the machinery and really feel like day-to-day that they are helping but sometimes they don't -- they aren't aware of either the unintended consequences or the consequences that have been preordained or planned but without their --</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Yes.</p><p>EGGERS:  -- knowledge.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean I wonder whether you even imagined that after you had written \"The Circle\" and after it was such a best seller, all this has come out about all the tech companies and whatever Facebook, Google, all of the sort of machinations that are going on.</p><p>And then people are really worried about what this is going to do to the species, to addiction, to as you say monopolies and control.</p><p>I wonder whether you had imagined that it would come true and I guess as a corollary to that, would you support democratic presidential candidates Senator Elizabeth Warren who said she will want to break up these big tech monopolies.</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes, I support what she's saying, absolutely.  I think it's -- they are monopolies and they're acting in a monopolistic way.  And so, we have laws that are meant -- anti-trust laws that are meant to combat that because it's not good a democratic society and it's not good for a capitalist society.</p><p>And so, I do support her in that.  And I thought it was very bold of her to propose it.  It has to be part of the 2020 conversation.  And I had a dim view of this went I wrote the book five years ago.  I thought things were trending one way.  They have gotten far worse.</p><p>But the one thing I'm gratified by or encouraged by is that when I wrote it, most people were still trusting I think of the motivations and business practices of a lot of these -- the larger tech companies.  And right now, I think most people are highly suspicious and highly wary and very open to more regulation and examination--</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Right.  You--</p><p>EGGERS:  That's at least gratifying.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, and last year you came back to this topic.  You did a lecture in which you called for sort of a digital human rights.  And you have said and spoken a lot about it.</p><p>Here you said talking about the complicity here, \"digital tools generally degrade us, specifically they make us in to needy maniacs, and the tech companies that we distrust act no better and no worse than we ourselves act with these tools.</p><p>Our complicity in the rise of these companies and in their increasing power is impossible to avoid or deny.  Every bit of power these companies have is power that we have given them.\"</p><p>So, basically you are there saying that it's not the smart phone or Apple or Zuckerberg that's involved, it's us who involved.  Is that what you're saying?</p><p>EGGERS:  Well the odd thing is, is that we don't have to use Facebook.  There are no laws that require us to use a platform that we inherently distrust and has been proven again and again to abuse and to have distained for the privacy of all of its users.</p><p>And so, there are so many ways to connect with each other online and share photos and all these other things that we want to do.  These wonderful things that we can do without having to empower a very bad actor.</p><p>And so, and that's what's funny to -- and frustrating I guess is that all this power, all this wealth, the aggregation of so much data, it's all data that we have given them for the most part.  And so, we do have choices.  Consumers really have power.</p><p>And I feel like if collectively we said well, this company, Facebook I think is the worst actor of all of them.  If we said we no longer trust you, we're not going to participate in your plan.  We're opting out.  And we're going to a platform like Neewee (ph) which is a nonprofit version of Facebook.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  I mean it strikes me as pretty gulling when I have read now in retrospect that a lot of the great geniuses, the great innovators of this tech and of these devices we're told didn't even allow their own children to use them until a certain age.</p><p>And here now we're talking about the responsibility of citizens.  But citizens who have become addicted, I mean this is lie being on a drug.  How do you get off it?</p><p>EGGERS:  Yes.  I can't count the number of tech inventors and innovators and very powerful people who send their kids to (inaudible) schools, which ban all technology at school and in the home.</p><p>And so they know something that a lot of users don't know, which is the highly addictive and (inaudible) sort of consequences of these tools, especially in the hands of very young kids.  They know best.</p><p>And I think that so many parents feel like they have to give their kids devices at a young age to keep them up with societal expectations or educational demands.  And this just isn't the case.  Sometimes these tools are way too powerful to be given to very young kids.</p><p>And I think that we just have to examine that as parents, as educators, schools, everybody really has to slow down a bit and say really what's best for the development of young minds and can we just sort of not channel all of our kids education through screens.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  One of the most adapt users of social media in all of this is the president of the United States.  I mean he is a real master of this art.  You have followed him for awhile.  I mean you've been to rallies in Texas and the rest.  And you've come about -- come away with some really interesting observations.  Notably perhaps that you know, Donald Trump could win again.</p><p>You write, we in the media have long seen Trump as a racist buffoon and a threat but his supporters see him as a man who gets things done, who speaks candidly, who's engineered an economic boom, the envy of the world, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>Just give me some, you know, eye witness accounts of your reporting to what makes you lead to your conclusion.</p><p>EGGERS:  I'm here in San Francisco.  We're in a bubble and we make certain assumptions including that he's very vulnerable and will be relatively easy to beat in 2020.  Then I went to that rally in El Paso where he rallied on one side of the street and Beto O'Rourke was on the other.</p><p>And I was shocked to see over the course of the day about 17,000 people line up to go to his rally.  Across the street may three, 4,000 people that go to Beto O'Rourke's rally.  And the people at the Trump rally were a very diverse audience.  El Paso is a very diverse city.</p><p>You know about 80 percent Latino and -- and it was reflected in the audience.  And I interviewed so many people who were so just rational in their support and why they supported him and they ignore so much of the tweeting and so much of the madness that we see in the president's behavior because the economic results over the last few years they value and they see their 401k going up.</p><p>They see employment opportunities available.  They see relatives who are in the military coming home.  They see all these sort of practical effects of the president's policies and they're -- they're giving him a real -- he's -- it makes him formidable for 2020.</p><p>So I came away thinking, all right, it's important to go out and actually interview people and not make assumptions or not get your information third hand from a couch in San Francisco.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Exactly.  Well -- well -- well put.</p><p>EGGERS:  So I think he'll be hard to beat.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well put.  Dave Eggers, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>EGGERS:  Thank you so much.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Now, where were you when man first stepped on the moon?  Everybody who watched has their own searing memory and they're own story.  Neil Armstrong setting foot out there and declaring, \"One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,\" is the stuff movies and dreams are made of.</p><p>But this very real heroic feat is the subject of a new documentary.  Showing us that moment 50 years ago, this July in a whole new light.  And here's a clip from the trailer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The whole Apollo Program was designed to get two Americans to the lunar surface and back again to earth safely.  The enormity of this event is something that only history will be able to judge.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Todd Douglas Miller is the director of Apollo 11.  He's been speaking with our Hari Sreenivasan about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>HARI SREENIVASAN, CNNI HOST:  You know never before seen footage is often used as a marketing gimmick.  But in this case it completely changed the composition of your film.</p><p>TODD DOUGLAS MILLER, DIRECTOR OF APOLLO 11:  Yes, I mean initially -- and this was the tail end of 2016, we cast a very wide net within the spider web network of NASA facilities and also the National Archives.</p><p>And three or four months into the project we get this email from the National Archives, our contact there, our archivist (ph) who said that they had -- had this collection of large format material that was previously, you know, uncataloged.</p><p>They didn't really know exactly what was on it.  They had -- it did have written on some of the reels, Apollo 11.  Some of the dates ended around the launch, which was July 16th of 1969.  So that began the process of discovering exactly what these were.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  How much footage are we talking about?</p><p>MILLER:  So hundreds of reels.  And it just wasn't in National Archives.  We also had access to another 100 reels of engineering 70 millimeter footage. So that's all the great slow motion, you know, rocket -- of the rocket taking off.  We had a ton of that stuff to go through.  And then if that wasn't enough, we were also alerted to over 11,000 hours of mission control audio that was uncovered by NASA.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  How do you get 11,000 hours?  I mean, what is - what are they recording for that long?</p><p>MILLER:  So it was really unique.  It was one inch tape.  If you could imagine, if you're sitting in mission control, you have 30 flight controllers.  Each one of those guys that's on a headset is recorded on a track in the back.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  So really, every word that was uttered in mission control had been recorded and sitting, gathering dust?</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, and not only that.  The backroom, each flight controller had an entire backroom full of other light controllers.  So they were all on loops.  So it was really, in essence, about 60 tracks that all needed to be synched up.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  But why take this on?  I mean, at this point, we probably have a memory of seeing that black and white footage.  Why - why do this as a film?</p><p>MILLER:  You know, it really started as an editing exercise, you know, with my archive producer Stephen Slater who's based in the U.K.  He had been synching up a lot of mission control footage with audio because when they originally shot it, it didn't have any sound on it.</p><p>So, you know, it gets addictive, you know, to try to figure out what these guys are saying at what times because they really shot it with no regard for if, you know, there was going to be any audio.  They were just kind of getting beauty shots of these guys working and documenting them for historical purposes.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  And once the large format stuff came into our purview, it felt like, you know, it - we were all, you know, wanting to work on something like this.  So we were kind of - it was the perfect team for this to land on.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  So you find all this video - film and you find all this audio.  What do you learn about this?</p><p>MILLER:  We learned a lot.  I mean, probably the greatest part of working on the project was working very closely with NASA's chief historian, Bill Barry, and his team, obviously, the National Archives as well, and then the families and Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.  Neil Armstrong's sons, Rick and Mark, they were one of the first people that we showed this footage to before we even started the process of -</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  What'd they think?</p><p>MILLER:  I mean, they were floored like everyone else.  You know, just when you thought you'd seen it all, and particularly for them.  I mean, they - you know, they were so gracious with their time in helping us out to, you know, really get the accuracy of not only the mission but also just the spirit of who their fathers were and the people that worked with them.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  But what is it about this moment, I mean - which might not happen ever again, maybe until we set foot on Mars or the aliens come down and talk to us?  It almost seemed to unite the entire planet.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  It was not lost on us at any time.  I can speak for the entire team.  It was just such a unique experience to - to witness the sheer scope of this.  You know, you put yourself back in the `60s and with JFK in this charge to the country to try to drum up support for the space program, which is very expensive to send someone to another planet or another world.</p><p>And all the political strife that was going on, you know, JFK himself, a year after his - his speech in Texas, is assassinated in Texas.  His brother is assassinated.  Dr. Martin Luther King is assassinated.  You have the background of the Vietnam War, but throughout all of that, you have hundreds of thousands of people that are spread across tens of thousands of companies that all came together to accomplish this one goal of putting a human on another world.  And it was - it's just miraculous.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  And you've got a clip of that that I want to show as well.  It starts with just kind of a long shot of how many people.  It's dizzying, even to think about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're past the six-minute mark in our countdown for Apollo 11.  Now, five minutes 52 seconds and counting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Inaudible).  Verify go for launch.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We have some 7.6 million pounds of thrust pushing the vehicle upward.  The vehicle weighs close to 6.5 million pounds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  That is a lot of people, and that's just a clip from the film to illustrate your point.  You know, one of the things that I remembered and I think most people nowadays, if - when they go to your film, what they'll see is - well, the first shots you had of mission control, it was almost like it was a uniform.  It was all white shirts, half-sleeve, with a tie, and almost all men.  There was one woman in the room that really caught - I was like, \"Wait a minute.  What's her story?\"</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, that's the beauty of really doing the research and going deep into the archive with the entire Apollo program.  There is one woman, her name is JoAnn Morgan.</p><p>Apollo 11 was the first time that she actually was in the firing room which was the launch control center which was adjacent to the pad down in Florida what was called Cape Kennedy at the time now, today Cape Canaveral.  And before the Saturn V rocket launched, she was just an amazing engineer.</p><p>She was there on her own credentials, didn't matter that she was a female.  And she ended up having a very long history with NASA.  Worked there for 43 years, retired and is still alive today.  And it just wasn't her.  We had unfortunately and hopefully this ends up on like a Blu-ray or DVD.</p><p>There was a 25 year old (inaudible) that was in the back room in mission control.  Her name was Poppy Northcutt; she actually on Apollo 13 was in the front room.  But there's a moment after lunar liftoff when they're arguing -- the flight controllers in the front room are arguing over flight trajectories.</p><p>So they consult with the back room.  Poppy comes on, and basically just schools these guys in some math.  And while their numbers are off and she's trying to articulate why they're wrong.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  And it takes about five minutes for her to finally get through to these guys.  But it just highlights the great effort of all, just not male, female, minorities across all races to put this thing together.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  One thing that surprised me was relatively speaking how advance the technology in some way was.  They were getting near real-time heart beats of these astronauts.  And I had no idea that in 1969 we had the tech and then afterwards I was stunned by how low and how cool they are.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, I mean sometimes I have a tough time calling my sister back in Ohio.  So, it's just a testament to the technological advances that the Apollo program did.  Certainly, if you listen to the air to ground transmissions, it's scratchy most of th time.  It's tough stuff to get through.</p><p>But they did it.  And they developed ways to communicate.  And that was just one of dozens of new technologies that were invented to put someone on the surface of the moon.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  At one point, at the takeoff I think, Buzz Aldrin's heart beat is around 88.  And then on the other end of the spectrum, Neil Armstrong's heart beat when he's about to land the thing is what, 100--</p><p>MILLER:  155.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  That is me on a treadmill at a good run, right?  I mean that's really exerting ourselves.  And here he is, the stress of that moment, you could see it was in his heart right there.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, but when you listen to Neil Armstrong's (inaudible) as they're landing, it never waivers.  So, he might've been stressing on the inside, but on the outside and it goes for all of the mission controllers during that moment.  Charley Duke famously says, \"Copy Eagle, you got a bunch of guys ready to turn blue here.  We're breathing again.\"</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Yes.</p><p>MILLER:  And it just goes to show kind of the nerves of steel.  And you have to remember, Buzz and Neil both were Korean War veterans.  They flew missions, dozens and dozens of combat missions.  Buzz himself shot down a mig (ph) and then pulled out a camera and photographed the pilot ejecting.</p><p>These guys had been hardened veterans of not only war but they were test pilots.  And unlike some of their predecessors in the space program, they were educated.  Neil had a degree in aeronautics.  Buzz went to MIT.  And they -- his nickname was Dr. Randevu.</p><p>Michael Collins was a graduate at West Point and ended up in the air force.  So, these guys had been around the block.  And it's no -- now you know why they were chosen to go about this extraordinary mission.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  And there was flying required back then.  I mean the -- we kind of take it for granted now.  But to get these things to connect and disconnect and really ultimately landing of where the module landed was by hand.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes.  I mean, Neil Armstrong certainly they had very archaic computers compared to now.  But to get them to a certain altitude and then Neil actually -- Neil Armstrong himself guided the lunar lander down to the surface of the moon.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Going through all this footage, what surprised you?</p><p>MILLER:  I think if you see the suiting up shots that was the most surprising for me.  I had seen those images a lot over the decades.  But I had never seen them like that.  And just opposed (ph) a real that came shortly after we had that real which from the day of the launch, the morning of the launch.  They're getting suited up to go on this amazing thing -- journey.</p><p>There was -- they were doing the same thing a few days before on a dry run.  And they were kind of slapping themselves on the back.  A bit jovial.  You know they did the same thing.  They went into the astrovan, drove out to the pad, got in the elevator, went -- sat on top of the rocket, came back down and went home.</p><p>But on the day of the launch, you just see this look on their faces.  There was no joking and you could just see the weight of what they were about to do written all over it.  And it just really snapped into focus, I think for all of us.</p><p>Their responsibility that they had to do that and also, you know in a very small way, our responsibility, you know to the imagery that we were luckily enough to be granted to work with.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  I didn't realize one of the first things that happened on the moon was to set up a camera.  I mean just like well there's scientific gear, et cetera, et cetera.  Actually he sets up the camera and you can see all of these shots of Buzz Aldrin coming down.</p><p>I mean it was just -- there's certainly forethought put in to what they should do and how it should be documented for the entire world to see.</p><p>MILLER:  Yes, the training was immense.  They -- you know they rehearsed down to the second exactly all the moves, choreographed.  One of the kind of humorous things was when they landed they were actually supposed to sleep.  They were supposed to have a sleep period.</p><p>But of course you land on the moon and I don't think anybody's going -- anybody's going to go to bed.  So they requested if they could, you know, perform their lunar excursion activities, the EVA first.  They were granted that.</p><p>And some of that imagery that we saw, you know at first, quite frankly the engineers at Goldstone, California weren't ready for it.  So that's why the image is flipped upside down.  There wasn't -- you know originally it was supposed to go to Australia and just the way that signal was, you know, sent to the earth it ended up at California.</p><p>So, you know, luckily we do have that imagery and lucky, you know, for me as a film maker, Buzz Aldrin documented with a 16 millimeter camera looking right down the barrel of the later, Neil's first steps.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Just suppose that capsule with what just happened a little awhile ago, SpaceX sending a capsule up, I mean you look around and every shot Buzz Aldrin -- the Armstrong, there's just switches and gear and buttons and lights everywhere.  And now it's this clean white wall, two LED screens.</p><p>I mean it's amazing that these three humans had to know how to work all of that manually.</p><p>MILLER:  What we've accomplished in 50 years, you know on the technology front, I think is -- is truly amazing and I'm -- I'm actually encouraged that you know companies like SpaceX working with NASA and all the great, you know, space programs all around the world, it's a very exciting time for the future of space travel because we're going to have to get out there, you know, at some point.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Why doesn't the government undertake anything like this?  Could it?  Should it?  Is it going to be replaced by private companies and is that the right way to get going in space?</p><p>MILLER:  I could speak to the historical context, which is -- you know John F. Kennedy made a charge to the country and -- and -- and went out and actually sold this.  So there was a political will that was established to make this happen.  Our legacy of Apollo, I think should be followed up.  It's inevitable.</p><p>You know we're -- as we grow as a population worldwide where we need, you know, new places to go.  Whether it happens, you know, a hundred years from now, a thousand, a million; it's going to happen.</p><p>And Apollo 11 serves as a -- the entire program serves as a -- as a primer for us to -- to get back out there.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Is that what you want people to take away from the film?</p><p>MILLER:  I think so but also just to be reminded that over the decades and as time has evolved, you know we -- we kind of get into our boxes, if you will, and events like this bring us together.  They unite us and they certainly did back then and they certainly can do again.</p><p>SREENIVASAN:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MILLER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>(END VIDEO)</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Well, I for one can never get enough of Apollo 11 and I'm going to be running, not walking to go and see this film.  And as Hari said in a sign of just how much private industry has taken over the space program, SpaceX just fully tested its dragon capsule, sending it to the international space station and then back to earth.</p><p>The company hopes the capsule will soon carry human astronauts, which would indeed be a landmark achievement for a private enterprise.  And that is it for now.  Remember you can always listen to our podcast.  You can see us online at amanpour.com and you can follow me on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.

Today a startup that's built a platform to help them navigate those waters more easily is announcing a round of funding to meet that demand.</p><p><br/>Ethyca, which lets organisations both identify where sensitive data may be used and then provides an easy set of API tools to create permissions, reporting and analytics around it, has raised $13.5 million in financing after picking up a number of major companies, including some high-profile tech companies, as customers.<br/>The crux of the issue that Ethyca is tackling is that online privacy compliance has become a critical issue, in part because of regulations, but mainly because the online world has, before anyone had a chance to blink, become a critical component of our lives, so getting things wrong can be disastrous.<br/>\"Move fast and break things sounds good on a T-shirt, but the web is effectively society infrastructure now,\" explained co-founder and CEO Cillian Kieran, who hails from Ireland but now lives in New York. \"If you met a bridge builder wearing a t-shirt saying that you'd panic. So despite the omnipresence of tech we don't have the tools to deal with privacy issues. The aim here is to build safe systems, and we provide the data and data maps to do that.\"<br/>The funding comes on the back of a seed round Ethyca raised in July 2019 and brings the total raised to about $20 million.\u00a0<br/>IA Ventures, Affirm and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin's SciFi VC, CAA co-founder Michael Ovitz, Warby Parker co-founders Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa, Harry's co-founder Jeff Raider, Allbird's co-founder Joey Zwillinge, Behance co-founder Scott Belsky, former Chief Data Scientist of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy DJ Patil, Lachy Groom and Abstract Ventures make up the long list of high-profile names and firms that are a part of this latest round, which speaks to some of the traction and attention that New York-based Ethyca has had to date.<br/>On the enterprise side, the company works with a number of large tech businesses, including banks and some major tech companies that don't want their names disclosed, to help them both better map personal data within their systems, as well as create better workflows for extracting that information when it's requested either by a user, or for the purposes of reporting for data compliance regulations, or more often to make sure that when new products are being built, they take that existing personal data into account comply with data policies around it.<br/>If it sounds odd that a tech company might need to turn to a third-party startup for privacy services, it's not so strange. Even at big tech companies, which would have spent years and millions of dollars preparing for privacy regulations, the complexity has meant that not all use cases can be accounted for.<br/>On the smaller end of the scale, it also has a number of well-known brands, like luggage company Away, Parachute Home and Aspire IQ, as well a number of other smaller businesses implementing its tools.<br/>As Kieran describes it, while there are already others out there building tools to navigate data protection and privacy regulations like CCPA and GDPR in Europe (OneTrust and DataGuard being two in the startup arena that have raised big rounds), the aim of Ethyca is to build a layer that makes it quick and relatively easy to implement a compliance layer into a system.<br/>The company has APIs but also now has introduced a self-service version of its product for smaller businesses, which he says means that \"any customer can turn it on and follow the automated process in a TurboTax type of way.\"<br/>CCPA compliance can take 8-10 weeks to implement, and you often need consultants and more technical talent to get the work done and run services afterwards, he said. \"Now it can be done in as little as an hour for an average midsized business.\" Larger companies may take a few days, he added.<br/>Kieran and his co-founder\u00a0Miguel Burger-Calderon know first-hand about some of the issues that brands and other online businesses might face when it comes to identifying what kind of data might fall under these newer regulations, and the challenges of navigating that once you do. BrandCommerce, a previous company that the two founded, helps brands and businesses build and run D2C operations online.

Continue reading Ethyca raises $13.5M to help businesses automate data privacy and compliance</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The upcoming CCPA regulations coming into effect in the US have put a renewed focus on how companies online are handling the issues of data privacy and compliance. Today a startup that s built a platform to help them navigate those waters more easily is announcing a round of funding to meet that demand.</p><p>Ethyca, which lets organisations both identify where sensitive data may be used and then provides an easy set of API tools to create permissions, reporting and analytics around it, has raised $13.5 million in financing after picking up a number of major companies, including some high-profile tech companies, as customers.</p><p>The crux of the issue that Ethyca is tackling is that online privacy compliance has become a critical issue, in part because of regulations, but mainly because the online world has, before anyone had a chance to blink, become a critical component of our lives so getting things wrong can be disastrous.</p><p> Move fast and break things sounds good on a T-shirt, but the web is effectively society infrastructure now,  explained co-founder and CEO Cillian Kieran, who hails from Ireland but now lives in New York.  If you met a bridge builder wearing a t-shirt saying that you d panic. So despite the omnipresence of tech we don t have the tools to deal with privacy issues. The aim here is to build safe systems, and we provide the data and data maps to do that. </p><p>The funding comes on the back of a seed round Ethyca raised in July 2019 and brings the total raised to about $20 million.</p><p>IA Ventures, Affirm and PayPal cofounder Max Levchin s SciFi VC, CAA cofounder Michael Ovitz, Warby Parker cofounders Neil Blumenthal and Dave Gilboa, Harry s cofounder Jeff Raider, Allbird s cofounder Joey Zwillinge, Behance cofounder Scott Belsky, former Chief Data Scientist of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy DJ Patil, Lachy Groom, and Abstract Ventures make up the long list of high-profile names and firms that are a part of this latest round, which speaks to some of the traction and attention that New York-based Ethyca has had to date.</p><p>On the enterprise side, the company works with a number of large tech businesses including banks and some major tech companies that don t want their names disclosed, to help them both better map personal data within their systems, as well as create better workflows for extracting that information when it s requested either by a user, or for the purposes of reporting for data compliance regulations, or more often to make sure that when new products are being built, that they take that existing personal data into account comply with data policies around it.</p><p>If it sounds odd that a tech company might need to turn to a third-party startup for privacy services, it s not so strange. Even at big tech companies, which would have spent years and millions of dollars preparing for privacy regulations, the complexity has meant that not all use cases can be accounted for.</p><p>On the smaller end of the scale, it also has a number of well known brands like luggage company Away, Parachute Home and Aspire IQ as well a number of other smaller businesses implementing its tools.</p><p>As Kieran describes it, while there are already others out there building tools to navigate data protection and privacy regulations like CCPA and GDPR in Europe (OneTrust and DataGuard being two in the startup arena that have raised big rounds), the aim of Ethyca is to build a layer that makes it quick and relatively easy to implement a compliance layer into a system.</p><p>The company has APIs but also now has introduced a self-service version of its product for smaller businesses, which he says means that  any customer can turn it on and follow the automated process in a TurboTax type of way. </p><p>CCPA compliance can take 8-10 weeks to implement, and you often need consultants and more technical talent to get the work done and run services afterwards, he said.  Now it can be done in as little as an hour for an average midsized business.  Larger companies may take a few days, he added.</p><p>Kieran and his co-founder Miguel Burger-Calderon know first-hand about some of the issues that brands and other online businesses might face when it comes to identifying what kind of data might fall under these newer regulations, and the challenges of navigating that once you do. BrandCommerce, a previous company that the two founded, helps brands and businesses build and run D2C operations online. (You can also see, therefore, why Ethyca may have in part picked up the particular investors that it has.)</p><p> Companies can no longer simply strive to be compliant and get by   enterprises need to think long-term and show their customers that they can be trusted with their data,  said Roger Ehrenberg of IA Ventures in a statement.  Forward-thinking companies have recognised the value of Ethyca s product to their bottom line as you can see from looking at the growing set of blue-chip brands and technology customers so far. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/ethyca-raises-4-2m-to-simplify-gdpr-compliance/\">https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/ethyca-raises-4-2m-to-simplify-gdpr-compliance/</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Ingrid Lunden<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2592025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603V-96S1-F08D-544J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><timeReceived>11:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 11, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Is this really a new world order or just a temporary situation caused by the unprecedented crisis the world is trying to navigate?\u00a0 \"In response to the strong demand we've seen from our client base asking for exposure to this part of the market in a regulated way, we have launched this portfolio. Many are viewing the low oil prices and impact this has had on some company's share prices as a buying opportunity.\u00a0 \"We believe that investing should be made as easy as possible for people and markets should be opened up for everyone to invest in a simple and transparent way. Our portfolios enable people to invest in themes and ideas, ranging from 5G technology to gaming and now the oil sector.\" Clients can invest in the OilWorldWide portfolio from as little as\u00a0$2,000 USD. 85% of the portfolio's allocation covers 20 of the largest oil companies in the world by market cap. 15% of the portfolio is allocated to oil ETFs such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR and SPDR S&amp;P Oil and Gas Exploration and Production as well as the oil futures contract available on eToro. eToro's growing list of portfolios have been designed to make thematic investing easy for retail clients, enabling them to gain exposure to developments in areas such as renewable energy, big tech, drone and 5G technology.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-72305BFCB2CA415683D775EC3B04C915</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSP-SS41-DYG0-729X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The DividendGrowth portfolio makes investing in dividend stocks easier for retail investors, who might not have the time or knowledge to research a number of stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/520426/eToro_Logo.jpg\"/></p><p>Dividend-paying stocks are typically robust and established businesses but share prices might not have a competitive return on investment compared with younger, high-growth companies. A dividend strategy means investors could potentially benefit from a modest uptick in share price and also receive a payout for their loyalty to a company.\u00a0</p><p>All stocks included in the DividendGrowth portfolio have consecutively paid out a dividend for the past 20 years. As well as screening for a consecutive dividend payment, eToro's Investment Office built the portfolio based on market cap, beta, 5-year dividend average growth and previous year dividend yield.\u00a0</p><p>Yoni Assia, CEO and Co-founder of eToro, comments:\"We believe that investing should be made as easy as possible for people. Ask any asset manager and they will say investing in dividend-paying stocks is one way to mitigate the downside of a volatile market. We know that not everyone has the time to research companies that pay a good and consistent dividend, so our new portfolio has already done the groundwork for them.\u00a0</p><p>\"Investing on eToro combines quality with convenience. The new DividendGrowth portfolio will mean, for a minimum investment of $2,000, investors can add 40 dividend-paying stocks to their overall portfolio and invest for the long term in one click.\"</p><p>eToro's expanding list of portfolios to date have been designed to help make thematic investing easy for retail clients, enabling them to gain exposure to developments in renewable energy, big tech, drone and 5G technology. The DividendGrowth portfolio is the first in eToro's 2020 roadmap to make traditional investment strategies more accessible for people.</p><p>Allocating part of an investor's portfolio to dividend paying stocks is a common practice for long term investors. The portfolio comprises 40 companies from around the world, including Proctor and Gamble, Diageo, IBM, Pepsico, AT&amp;T and L'Oreal.</p><p>Notes to editors</p><p>Visit our website for more information on theDividendGrowth portfolio.</p><p>About eToroeToro was founded in 2007 with the vision of opening up the global markets so that everyone can invest in a simple and transparent way.

L'hypoth\u00e8se para\u00eet incongrue. Les banques n'ont pas bonne presse au motif qu'elles forment un oligopole vivant grassement de notre argent. On les accuse de sp\u00e9culation, de \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> financiarisation</emphasis>\u00bb, de jouer avec les flux internationaux de capitaux et de planquer des milliards dans les paradis fiscaux. La banque, entendez \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">l'ennemi \u00bb</emphasis>de la finance, a trop de place \u00e9conomique et trop de pouvoir politique, l'id\u00e9e serait plut\u00f4t de lui serrer la vis. A voir leurs profits, les banques ne semblent aucunement menac\u00e9es. Alors ?</p><h>Nationalisme jaloux</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Les grandes banques europ\u00e9ennes sont pourtant en train de perdre pied dans la comp\u00e9tition mondiale. L'\u00e9croulement des g\u00e9ants allemands Commerzbank et Deutsche Bank est une alarme. Les banques europ\u00e9ennes font l'objet d'attaques conjointes qui am\u00e8nent \u00e0 se poser la question sinon de leur survie, du moins de leur d\u00e9clin, et, en cons\u00e9quence, de la souverainet\u00e9 bancaire de l'Union. La banque, qu'on l'aime ou pas, est un pilier indispensable du financement de l'\u00e9conomie, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9pargne et, comme premier relais de l'euro, de notre ind\u00e9pendance mon\u00e9taire.</p><p>Les attaques sont au nombre de quatre. D'abord la r\u00e9gulation qui impose des contraintes de fonds propres et de liquidit\u00e9s (B\u00e2le III), jug\u00e9es aujourd'hui excessivement paralysantes. Les r\u00e8gles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieusement renforc\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la crise des subprimes de 2008, personne ne l'a contest\u00e9. Mais les banques europ\u00e9ennes jugent aujourd'hui que trop, c'est trop. La n\u00e9cessaire concentration europ\u00e9enne est rendue interdite par l'ajout de ces ratios prudentiels \u00e0 la survivance d'un nationalisme jaloux. On l'a observ\u00e9 avec la Commerzbank, dont personne n'a voulu : les rachats transnationaux sont devenus st\u00e9riles ou impossibles. Or, et c'est le deuxi\u00e8me front d'attaque, aux Etats-Unis, les banques n'ont pas ces boulets au pied. Les concurrentes am\u00e9ricaines se sont all\u00e8grement dispens\u00e9es de B\u00e2le III et ont op\u00e9r\u00e9 chez elles un m\u00e9nage pour r\u00e9duire \u00e0 trois le nombre de banques par comt\u00e9. Les banques am\u00e9ricaines engrangent des marges sup\u00e9rieures aux Etats-Unis pour venir prendre des parts de march\u00e9 en Europe. Le cr\u00e9neau lucratif de la banque d'investissement (les grandes op\u00e9rations comme les acquisitions et les fusions) a subi une razzia. Les europ\u00e9ennes en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9es. En outre, l'administration de Washington est intervenue pour salement punir d'amendes tr\u00e8s lourdes les europ\u00e9ennes qui n'ont pas respect\u00e9 des lois am\u00e9ricaines extraterritoriales. Bref, comme la Chine triche dans l'industrie, l'Am\u00e9rique \u00ab triche \u00bb dans la finance.</p><p>Troisi\u00e8me motif de crainte : les taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat bas ou nuls qui abaissent ou r\u00e9duisent \u00e0 z\u00e9ro le rendement des cr\u00e9dits bancaires. Les banques ont compens\u00e9 en taxant les tenues de compte (ce qui alimente les grognements des clients) mais le m\u00e9tier d'une banque qui est de recueillir les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts (gratuits) des m\u00e9nages pour leur pr\u00eater (avec profit) n'a plus de sens si les cr\u00e9dits ne rapportent plus.</p><p>La derni\u00e8re offensive, plus nouvelle, plus existentielle, vient de la technologie. La Fin Tech et la Big Tech, autrement dit les start-up qui proposent des nouveaux produits financiers en ligne et les Gafa qui d\u00e9barquent sur le terrain du paiement en se moquant des fronti\u00e8res r\u00e9glementaires, pourraient attirer en masse les clients.</p><h>Vitesse d'adaptation</h><p>La banque traditionnelle domine encore (les deux tiers des activit\u00e9s de financement), elle a les moyens de r\u00e9sister. La plupart des grandes banques ont bien compris le danger et elles rach\u00e8tent des fintechs \u00e0 tour de bras. Mais la lutte contre la Big Tech est plus difficile, car les banques font payer leurs clients, tandis que Facebook, Google qui vient de l'annoncer, et les autres peuvent offrir des services gratuits en se r\u00e9mun\u00e9rant sur l'exploitation des donn\u00e9es de paiement qu'elles s'approprient.</p><p>Le secteur doit gagner en vitesse d'adaptation. Les banques europ\u00e9ennes ferment des guichets et suppriment des emplois (50.000 depuis le d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e). Mais l'argent \u00e9tant un bien souverain, la r\u00e9action devrait aujourd'hui venir des nouvelles Commission et Banque centrale, notent les \u00e9conomistes Thomas Philippon, Nicolas V\u00e9ron et alii (1). Pour compl\u00e9ter - enfin - le march\u00e9 unique bancaire, pour trouver un \u00e9quilibre \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> entre la stabilit\u00e9, la concurrence et le droit des donn\u00e9es personnelles \u00bb</emphasis>. Pour surtout prendre conscience du p\u00e9ril et se fixer une doctrine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de d\u00e9fense des banques avant que, sauf exceptions, elles ne deviennent des nains.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>fichier PDF de ce document</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2019111513\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"19311\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LESECH-0602238090855</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LESECH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH7-B7T1-F066-M1DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">233065</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>N\u00b0. 23075</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>vendredi 15 novembre 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002CBQ</classCode><className>COMMERZBANK AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

L'hypoth\u00e8se para\u00eet incongrue. Les banques n'ont pas bonne presse au motif qu'elles forment un oligopole vivant grassement de notre argent. On les accuse de sp\u00e9culation, de \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> financiarisation</emphasis>\u00bb, de jouer avec les flux internationaux de capitaux et de planquer des milliards dans les paradis fiscaux. La banque, entendez \u00ab<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">l'ennemi \u00bb</emphasis>de la finance, a trop de place \u00e9conomique et trop de pouvoir politique, l'id\u00e9e serait plut\u00f4t de lui serrer la vis. A voir leurs profits, les banques ne semblent aucunement menac\u00e9es. Alors ?</p><h>Nationalisme jaloux</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Les grandes banques europ\u00e9ennes sont pourtant en train de perdre pied dans la comp\u00e9tition mondiale. L'\u00e9croulement des g\u00e9ants allemands Commerzbank et Deutsche Bank est une alarme. Les banques europ\u00e9ennes font l'objet d'attaques conjointes qui am\u00e8nent \u00e0 se poser la question sinon de leur survie, du moins de leur d\u00e9clin, et, en cons\u00e9quence, de la souverainet\u00e9 bancaire de l'Union. La banque, qu'on l'aime ou pas, est un pilier indispensable du financement de l'\u00e9conomie, de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9pargne et, comme premier relais de l'euro, de notre ind\u00e9pendance mon\u00e9taire.</p><p>Les attaques sont au nombre de quatre. D'abord la r\u00e9gulation qui impose des contraintes de fonds propres et de liquidit\u00e9s (B\u00e2le III), jug\u00e9es aujourd'hui excessivement paralysantes. Les r\u00e8gles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieusement renforc\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la crise des subprimes de 2008, personne ne l'a contest\u00e9. Mais les banques europ\u00e9ennes jugent aujourd'hui que trop, c'est trop. La n\u00e9cessaire concentration europ\u00e9enne est rendue interdite par l'ajout de ces ratios prudentiels \u00e0 la survivance d'un nationalisme jaloux. On l'a observ\u00e9 avec la Commerzbank, dont personne n'a voulu : les rachats transnationaux sont devenus st\u00e9riles ou impossibles. Or, et c'est le deuxi\u00e8me front d'attaque, aux Etats-Unis, les banques n'ont pas ces boulets au pied. Les concurrentes am\u00e9ricaines se sont all\u00e8grement dispens\u00e9es de B\u00e2le III et ont op\u00e9r\u00e9 chez elles un m\u00e9nage pour r\u00e9duire \u00e0 trois le nombre de banques par comt\u00e9. Les banques am\u00e9ricaines engrangent des marges sup\u00e9rieures aux Etats-Unis pour venir prendre des parts de march\u00e9 en Europe. Le cr\u00e9neau lucratif de la banque d'investissement (les grandes op\u00e9rations comme les acquisitions et les fusions) a subi une razzia. Les europ\u00e9ennes en ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9es. En outre, l'administration de Washington est intervenue pour salement punir d'amendes tr\u00e8s lourdes les europ\u00e9ennes qui n'ont pas respect\u00e9 des lois am\u00e9ricaines extraterritoriales. Bref, comme la Chine triche dans l'industrie, l'Am\u00e9rique \u00ab triche \u00bb dans la finance.</p><p>\u00ab Les Gafa qui d\u00e9barquent sur le terrain du paiement en se moquant des fronti\u00e8res r\u00e9glementaires pourraient attirer en masse les clients \u00bb</p><p>Troisi\u00e8me motif de crainte : les taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat bas ou nuls qui abaissent ou r\u00e9duisent \u00e0 z\u00e9ro le rendement des cr\u00e9dits bancaires. Les banques ont compens\u00e9 en taxant les tenues de compte (ce qui alimente les grognements des clients) mais le m\u00e9tier d'une banque qui est de recueillir les d\u00e9p\u00f4ts (gratuits) des m\u00e9nages pour les pr\u00eater (avec profit) n'a plus de sens si les cr\u00e9dits ne rapportent plus.</p><p>La derni\u00e8re offensive, plus nouvelle, plus existentielle, vient de la technologie. La Fin Tech et la Big Tech, autrement dit les start-up qui proposent des nouveaux produits financiers en ligne et les Gafa qui d\u00e9barquent sur le terrain du paiement en se moquant des fronti\u00e8res r\u00e9glementaires, pourraient attirer en masse les clients.</p><h>Vitesse d'adaptation</h><p>La banque traditionnelle domine encore (les deux tiers des activit\u00e9s de financement), elle a les moyens de r\u00e9sister. La plupart des grandes banques ont bien compris le danger et elles rach\u00e8tent des fintechs \u00e0 tour de bras. Mais la lutte contre la Big Tech est plus difficile, car les banques font payer leurs clients, tandis que Facebook, Google qui vient de l'annoncer, et les autres peuvent offrir des services gratuits en se r\u00e9mun\u00e9rant sur l'exploitation des donn\u00e9es de paiement qu'elles s'approprient.</p><h>Lire aussi :</h><p>Uber Money, dernier symbole de l'offensive des Gafa contre les banques</p><p>Le secteur doit gagner en vitesse d'adaptation. Les banques europ\u00e9ennes ferment des guichets et suppriment des emplois (50.000 depuis le d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e). Mais l'argent \u00e9tant un bien souverain, la r\u00e9action devrait aujourd'hui venir des nouvelles Commission et Banque centrale, notent les \u00e9conomistes Thomas Philippon, Nicolas V\u00e9ron et alii (1).

Companies that sell products online, or index retail listings, will have to be transparent about how they deal with rivals and work to avoid conflicts.The new guidelines have been agreed by the union, and will move on to being approved by lawmakers and then adopted into domestic law. </p><p>It will cover a number of large comparison sites and shopping platforms, including eBay, Google Play, Skyscanner and Facebook's business listings.Core to this will be that companies, like Google, eBay and Amazon, will have to reveal how they rank rival products against their own. For example, Google would need to explain how it ranks two, similarly-rated restaurants in the same area and allow them a chance to improve their rating.Similarly, if Amazon dropped the ranking, or the pages, of a small business using the platform to sell, it couldn't simply kill the listing and move on. It would need to explain its rationale, and offer an easy channel to resolve any dispute.If you're unfamiliar, the European Union is the pan-continental body[2] that represents and administers the single market. It's essentially a body that ensures that Europe is, and remains, a free market, blocking monopoly and anti-competitive practices.That has put the EU up against Google, which it says has abused its dominant position[3] in both search and mobile. Amazon could be next in its sights, with regulators in various countries[4] wondering if the site promotes its own products over those of third-parties -- or copies popular products sold by third parties.

The US antitrust subcommittee hearing on 29 July levelled many strong allegations against the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, focusing mainly on illegal uses of data and acquisitions.  Timeline for Comment wire   Misconduct on the part of these four tech giants is now undeniable, but will have done little to advance the case in the US for \u2018breaking them up\u2019.   The \u2018Break Up Big Tech\u2019 lobby in the US is weak, because of the difficulty of linking data-driven antitrust practices to the size of the companies.   As such, these are practices which require targeted regulation, not an over-simplistic breakup of their many subsidiaries.   Amazon especially has little to fear from the \u2018break up\u2019 lobby, since its subsidiaries are practically irrelevant to the antitrust violations that form the foundation of the case against it.  The EU is taking a different approach with Big Tech companies   Following the US hearing, the European Commission\u2019s (EC) digital chief Margrethe Vestager called for a \u201ccommon vision\u201d between the EU and the US regarding tech regulation.   This reflects the critical difference of approach taken in the EU, where \u2018breaking them up\u2019 has never been a serious proposal.   The EU\u2019s alternatives have in the past not been much more successful; Google\u2019s $8bn of EU fines have done nothing to reduce its power over the market and users\u2019 data.   However, a Digital Services Act (DSA) is now in the pipeline, and will be seen as the follow-up to the EU\u2019s standard-setting GDPR regulation.   It is expected to be preceded by the final report on an investigation into Amazon\u2019s antitrust practices that began in July 2019.  Alternative strategy on Amazon is more likely to be effective   The Amazon report will be an important indicator of the approach to be taken in the DSA, putting Amazon first-in-line for regulation under the EC\u2019s new strategy.   3 Things That Will Change the World Today  Get the Verdict morning email     The EC has promised a singular legal focus that will make its reports and their hoped-for legislative results harder to argue with than the fractious arguments posed in the US.   It will scrutinize the \u2018dual position\u2019 of tech giants, which for Amazon means being a competitor in a marketplace where it also sets the rules.   It will also encompass the use of third-party sellers\u2019 data, one point which Amazon\u2019s CEO Jeff Bezos was unable to deny during his subcommittee hearing.

As for the big companies themselves, a crucial challenge this year looks likely to come from Europe.</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, has new powers allowing her to bring together the issues of privacy, monopoly and security. She has called for the burden of proof in antitrust cases to be put on the larger companies (small ones often go out of business fighting the titans, who have deep pockets and big legal staffs).</p><p>Ms Vestager has floated the idea of using obscure rules that could force companies to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from activities considered problematic while waiting for the outcome of antitrust cases. These include competing in allegedly unfair ways on their platforms against their own customers, or refusing to allow audit of algorithmic bias.</p><p>We shall probably not see a big antitrust case resolved in 2020 (they tend to take years) but it is likely that the idea of consumer harm, and in particular consumer prices, as the final measure of monopoly will be challenged. US and European regulators are starting to look closely at whether traditional University of Chicago thinking on monopoly, which has reigned supreme for 40 years, makes any sense in the digital age.</p><p>Chicago School thinking held that as long as consumer prices were falling there was no competition problem. But when transactions are done in data rather than dollars, such ideas may be less relevant. Big technology companies offer services that seem to be free, yet consumers are paying with their own data in opaque and asymmetric transactions. Only the company itself knows how much the data is worth.</p><p>Ms Vestager has advanced the idea that Big Tech should have to show how it helps consumers, rather than merely that it does not harm them. She wants to connect the dots between how companies use data \u2014 and whether they might layer from different sources (search, handsets, apps, etc) in ways that are anti-competitive. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-weighs-seeking-injunction-against-facebook-over-how-its-apps-interact-11576178055\"> company like Facebook</url>, for example, may garner unfair advantages by combining data from various apps that it has acquired.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission, the regulator, is considering an injunction against Facebook on the sharing of data between Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. This could force not only new disclosures on data value and how much it is worth to the company (something that states like California are pushing for) but also more algorithmic transparency about how data are used.</p><p>Regulators will probably dig into the buying and selling of digital advertising via companies like Google. Some policymakers believe these have an unfair advantage against competitors, because of their hold on advertising space. Google and Facebook together take most of the world\u2019s digital ad dollars.</p><p>We shall see more scrutiny of whether Amazon, which dominates ecommerce outside China, has an unfair advantage against its own suppliers \u2014 since it both owns the network and also sells its own products on it, thus competing against them. History records that 19th century US railway companies, which owned networks and conducted commerce on them, were broken up as monopolies.</p><p>Finally, there will be growing pressure from politicians who want to turn back CDA230, the regulatory loophole that allows platform companies to avoid liability for nearly everything that users say or do online. This move is, in part, to combat the problem of election manipulation.</p><p>Big Tech continues to use its formidable lobbying power to push back against the onslaught. While the Trump administration seemed at one point to be critical of platform companies, the US government has inserted loopholes like CDA230 into the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal. It is also trying to make it part of any <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-trade-agreement-extends-cda-section-230-immunity-abroad\"> new transatlantic deals</url>.</p><p>Tech companies are building new caches of data in fields like finance and healthcare, with ventures that allow them to partner with and mine data from banks, hospitals, and insurance firms. They are also doing more sharing with each other \u2014 Apple, Amazon and Google have teamed up on standards for the smart home, in an attempt to avoid a turf war over voice assistants, like Siri and Alexa. Use of these devices is growing exponentially and help the companies farm ever more data, more persuasively. Research shows that consumers are more influenced by voice suggestions than those in text. The worry is that a company like Amazon could use Alexa to push consumers towards certain products that are more profitable for the company.</p><p>Already, regulators are looking into whether Big Tech\u2019s forays into finance and healthcare may break existing privacy rules in those industries. But perhaps the biggest 2020 battle will be between the US and China which, despite a recent trade agreement, will continue to fight for control of the high-growth industries of the future. </p><p>Each side has its warriors, whether tech companies (Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook in the US; Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba in China), or chipmakers (Qualcomm versus Huawei). One likely impact will be the continued \u201c decoupling\u201d of the US and Chinese tech supply chains. This is supported by the Trump administration and odd bedfellows from rightwing defence hawks to progressive labour advocates. </p><p>The same goes in China, where a nationalistic government seeks to ringfence the entire innovation ecosystem and make the Middle Kingdom independent from western technology within a few years. At the same time, it wants to spread the power, wealth and standards of the surveillance state into a host of new countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>This battle could give cover to the US Big Tech companies. They will continue to position themselves as \u201cnational champions\u201d in the fight against China.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-f7b13372379711eaa6d39a26f8c3cba4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-GH61-JB77-K463-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

At issue is Amazon's potential use of data it can gather from the independent companies on its platform and if the company uses this information for its own benefit. The regulatory body said this may be the case \"based on the Commission's preliminary fact-finding\" investigation. </p><p>Amazon said in a statement obtained by CNBC it will \"cooperate fully\" with the European Commission and \"continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\"Why It's ImportantThe E.U.'s investigation comes barely a week after France approved a new tax on American big tech companies, including Amazon. The Trump administration argued the European nation is \"unfairly\" targeting American companies. The argument that the E.U. unfairly targets American companies is one that was made before the Trump administration took office. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said it's not right[3] for \"tax authorities in other jurisdictions to reach into our tax base.\" If the investigation concludes Amazon is guilty in violating competition rules, the E.U. could impose a penalty up to 10% of its global annual revenues. Amazon shares traded around $2,003 in Wednesday's pre-market session.
