So I think that if what you care about is democracy and elections, then you want a company like us to be able to invest billions of dollars per year like we are in building up really advanced tools to fight election interference.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A day later, Nick Clegg, Facebook vice president for global affairs and communications, wrote an op-ed in the New York Times where he made the case that it's time for new regulations governing social media and greater oversight - not dismantling the company, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Facebook shouldn't be broken up - but it does need to be held to account,\" Clegg wrote. \"Anyone worried about the challenges we face in an online world should look at getting the rules of the internet right, not dismantling successful American companies.\"</p><p>Facebook's call for regulation rang hollow with its critics, especially after more than a year of repeated privacy and safety incidents have exposed how the company deflected scrutiny from policymakers in times of crisis. Facebook's detractors say the company is right that new regulations are needed - but that they should be in addition to, not in place, of a breakup.          </p><p>From Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group representing the digial content industry:</p><p>Matthew Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, which pushes for increased antitrust enforcement, said:</p><p>Alex Stamos, a former Facebook chief security officer, noted that there can be legitimate arguments for breaking up Facebook, but at the same time, it may not fix all of the underlying problems facing social media:\u00a0</p><p>Facebook officials leapt into action\u00a0after the social network's co-founder Chris Hughes wrote a scalding op-ed\u00a0last weel in the New York Times reigniting\u00a0debate over the company's power and influence over democratic institutions. Hughes argued in his piece that unwinding Facebook's acquisitions Instagram and WhatsApp is the only way to hold the company to account, largely because it has plenty of resources to comply with fines or new rules that policymakers levy against it.</p><p>The call was preceded by ones from Democrats running for the White House in 2020, most prominently Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Others like Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) have followed. Yesterday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he wouldn't go that far, however.</p><p>\"I think we have to seriously take a look at that (breaking up Facebook), yes,\" Harris said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. She said very few people can get by in their communities, business or commerce without somehow using Facebook. \"So we have to recognize it for what it is. It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\"</p><p>The op-ed follows more than a year of political headaches for Facebook, which has been increasingly in Washington's sights since the 2016 election. The company has faced scrutiny for disinformation campaigns targeting voters on its service, as well as repeated privacy issues. The Federal Trade Commission is currently probing the company for privacy lapses that may have broken a previous agreement made with Facebook. Facebook recently told investors it set aside billions of dollars for a fine. But many critics say Washington needs to do more than just fine the company in order to\u00a0send a strong message to all of Silicon Valley.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Booker, a 2020 presidential candidate with deep ties to Silicon Valley, struck a more cautious note than his rivals on breaking up big companies like Facebook,\u00a0according to a report from my colleague Robert\u00a0Costa.\u00a0</p><p>\"I don't care if it's Facebook, the pharma industry, even the agricultural industry. We've had a problem in America with corporate consolidation that is having really ill effects,\" the New Jersey Democrat said on ABC News's \"This Week\" with George Stephanopoulos.</p><p>But, Booker added, \"I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here. It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say - 'I'm going to break up you guys.' \"</p><p>Booker, who worked with Zuckerberg on a $100 million plan to overhaul Newark schools when he was the city's mayor, said he would instead encourage the Justice Department to take the lead.\u00a0</p><p>             Booker's more measured tone stands in contrast to Harris, another candidate backed by Silicon Valley insiders, and Sen. Warren, who made breaking up Big Tech one of her campaign's key policy proposals earlier this year.\u00a0          </p><p>             NIBBLES: A crop of websites and social media accounts linked to Russia or far-right groups are blasting disinformation ahead of critical elections for the European Parliament,\u00a0according to Matt Apuzzo and Adam Satariano of the New York Times. E.U. investigators, academic and advocacy groups say the efforts share tactics used in previous Russian operations, such as the spread of disinformation ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections.\u00a0</p><p>\"Fringe political commentary sites in Italy, for instance, bear the same electronic signatures as pro-Kremlin websites, while a pair of German political groups share servers used by the Russian hackers who attacked the Democratic National Committee,\" Apuzzo and Satariano write.\u00a0</p><p>The Times reporters note the findings underscore that despite efforts among U.S. tech companies to combat disinformation, it's still easier to spread it than stop it. The researchers found that especially on the far right, copycats are imitating the Russian playbook. Because these groups can repeat pro-Kremlin talking points, it's difficult to determine whether the false information emanates from Russia, the far right or genuine political debate.\u00a0</p><p>While there are uncertainties about to whom to who to attribute this disinformation, it's clear that divisive stories about the European Union, NATO and conspiracy theories such as those about the Notre Dame cathedral fires are proliferating on services like Facebook, its subsidiary\u00a0WhatsApp, and Twitter.</p><p>\"The goal here is bigger than any one election,\" Daniel Jones, a former F.B.I. analyst and Senate investigator, told the Times. \"It is to constantly divide, increase distrust and undermine our faith in institutions and democracy itself. They're working to destroy everything that was built post-World War II.\"</p><p>             BYTES: Facebook says it wants to signal that it is cracking down on app developers that violate its privacy policies,\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm reports.\u00a0The company on Friday said it sued a South Korean analytics company that may have mishandled users' personal information.\u00a0          </p><p>The lawsuit, filed in a San Mateo, Calif., court, targets Rankwave, a company that offered at least 30 apps to consumers and businesses. Facebook says Rankwave may have improperly obtained comments or other data from pages it operated\u00a0\"for its own business purposes,\" possibly with the goal of \"providing consulting services to advertisers and marketing companies.\"</p><p>Facebook said Rankwave wouldn't comply with the social network's investigation into the matter, ignoring questions about whether it violated Facebook's rules and shared the data with other clients. Rankwave denied the allegations in February, according to the filing, but Facebook says it never provided sufficient proof.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook is increasingly pursuing litigation against developers that it believes are breaking its rules. This year, the social network sued a New Zealand-based company that it says attempted to sell fake likes on its subsidiary Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>\"By filing the lawsuit, we are sending a message to developers that Facebook is serious about enforcing our policies, including requiring developers to cooperate with us during an investigation,\" Jessica Romero, the director of platform enforcement and litigation at Facebook,\u00a0wrote in a blog post.</p><p>Emailed late Friday, Rankwave in South Korea did not immediately respond.</p><p>             -- Tech news from the private sector:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Tech news from the public sector:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Tech news generating buzz around the Web:\u00a0          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-59e1220af652494dbbf1f4dcfa0e4f1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3N-4HX1-DXKP-J01G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1446\"/><timeReceived>12:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 13, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But hours after that announcement,\u00a0Facebook confirmed\u00a0in its quarterly earnings report that the FTC has opened another formal investigation, this time into antitrust concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The probe is in addition to a\u00a0broad antitrust review of the tech giants that the Justice Department announced earlier this week, as well as a bipartisan House investigation\u00a0into tech's power and impact on competition.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It looks like the antitrust winter is over,\" Columbia University law professor Tim Wu, who chronicled the subject in his book \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\" told my colleagues earlier this week.\u00a0</p><p>             But Facebook seems likely to\u00a0prove resilient despite unprecedented political pressure and record-breaking fines.\u00a0          </p><p>             The company's stock soared\u00a0as it posted strong earnings - on the same day\u00a0it\u00a0announced the antitrust probe, a historic $5 billion settlement with the FTC with new limitations on its business and a $100 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.          </p><p>             The stark contrast\u00a0underscores\u00a0how Wall Street has been unfazed by Washington's efforts to rein in the social networking giant.\u00a0And that's where the true test might be, analysts told my colleagues Tony Romm and Elizabeth Dwoskin. The company has been able to continue to grow its business,\u00a0reaching $16.9 billion in revenue last quarter, beating analyst estimates of $16.49 billion,\u00a0despite the compounding political headaches in Washington.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's a balancing act for Zuckerberg and Facebook to navigate this, because investors want to see growth and profitability,\" Daniel Ives, managing director for equity research at Wedbush, told my colleagues.\u00a0</p><p>             \"But in terms of the stock, Facebook and Zuckerberg have been almost Teflon-like over the last two years,\" Ives continued. \"And as long as they continue to execute, all the other issues . . . will become background noise.\"</p><p>             The stock's resilience has stoked fears in Washington that federal regulators are not doing enough to hold the company to account. Congressional Democrats and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) both blasted the FTC's settlement with Facebook yesterday, arguing that it did not place enough limitations on Facebook's business practices. There are growing concerns that the agency doesn't have the resources or the will to police tech giants in a meaningful way, even as it becomes more aggressive in opening investigations into these companies.\u00a0</p><p>Hawley told\u00a0Tony that yesterday's FTC settlement with Facebook amounted to a \"parking ticket\" that\u00a0\"will not deter them in any way.\"</p><p>\"I\u00a0don't have a lot of confidence in the FTC even if they had an actionable claim,\" he said.\u00a0\"They would act push for and show the tenacity and the guts to bring it because frankly they haven't done it to date.\"</p><p>             The FTC's antitrust probe of Facebook will be a new test of the agency's power at a time when some are questioning if it should have oversight over Big Tech.\u00a0          </p><p>\"It's not clear to me whether they need more budget, more staff,\" Hawley told Tony.\u00a0\"I'm wondering whether we need to reassign their jurisdiction to another agency.\"</p><p>             Some tech policy experts who were disappointed by the FTC's settlement with Facebook over its privacy practices saw the new antitrust probe as a \"silver lining.\" Ashkan Soltani, a former FTC chief technologist, said:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Tech companies like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are outsourcing critical content moderation jobs to the Philippines, where workers are making decisions about whether massacres or suicides should stay online. But with thousands of miles separating them from Silicon Valley, these workers are vulnerable to exploitation by the tech giants, my colleagues Elizabeth Dwoskin, Jeanne Whalen and Regine Cabato write.</p><p>In interviews with my colleagues, 14 current and former moderators in the Philippines \"described a workplace where nightmares, paranoia and obsessive ruminations were common consequences of the job. Several described seeing colleagues suffer mental breakdowns at their desks. One of them said he attempted suicide as a result of the trauma.\"</p><p>Lester, a man who worked as a contractor for YouTube and Twitter in Manila, prays every week that God will \"white out\" the terrible images he's seen from his memory. \"He made decisions about whether a child's genitals were being touched accidentally or on purpose, or whether a knife slashing someone's neck depicted a real-life killing - and if such content should be allowed online,\" my colleagues write. \"He's still haunted by what he saw. Today, entering a tall building triggers flashbacks to the suicides he reviewed, causing him to entertain the possibility of jumping.\"</p><p>The technology companies keep workers like Lester at a distance, hiring them through major outsourcing firms rather than directly. Workers in the Philippines told my colleagues that the companies don't provide enough support to address the psychological toll of the job. They can't talk to friends about it because of the confidentiality agreements they signed, and they have daily accuracy targets that make it difficult for them to take breaks.</p><p>In interviews, the tech companies told my colleagues that they're still grappling with how to offer psychological support and better workplace conditions for these workers whose jobs were created in a hurry.</p><p>             NIBBLES: A White House summit on social media boosted the followings of the conservative figures who attended to share stories about being censored,my colleague Drew Harwell reports. Fifteen of the event's invitees saw their Twitter audiences grow by a combined 197,000 followers - a 75 percent jump over the number of followers they gained in the same period before the event, according to a Washington Post analysis.</p><p>Drew found that the 15 accounts tweeted more than\u00a06,000 times in the two weeks since - often echoing the claims of their host, President Trump. They posted tweets calling former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III a \"senile\" \"leftist\" leading a \"hit-job\" as he went in front of Congress and spread meme after meme against him.</p><p>Some experts told Drew that the summit proved to be opposite of what was advertised. Rather than \"censoring\" conservatives, fringe actors have used claims of bias to launch their own star power. With Republicans on Capitol Hill leading the way\u00a0 -\u00a0they hosted\u00a0another hearing on anti-conservative bias just last week\u00a0  - conservative stars remain convinced of their oppression.</p><p>\"While I might be able to reach a few hundred thousand with suppression, I could reach millions without it,\" David J. Harris Jr., a black conservative author who attended the summit, told Drew. \"Who knows how far it could grow?\"</p><p>             BYTES: With a new $5 million gift from Craig Newmark Philanthropies, the Internet Observatory hopes to give researchers new tools to study the influence of social media on areas including public health, terrorist content and disinformation\u00a0with a cross-disciplinary academic research.          </p><p>\"If you're an astronomer here at Stanford, you don't have to go raise $5 billion to launch your own Hubble Space Telescope. You go rent time\u00a0on existing systems that can be used for scientific study,\" said Alex Stamos, the project's director. \"We want to build that telescope to peer into the Internet. You can come and partner with us to do that work without having to get your own graduate students that write Python or without having to sign data-access agreements with the companies.\"</p><p>Among the Internet Observatory's first policy goals is to deliver recommendations on how to jointly protect the 2020 U.S. presidential election to Congress and the major technology firms. The team has already made dozens of recommendations to Congress and is focusing now on diving into areas where members have expressed interest, including advertising disclosure, and building a consortium between companies to share data.\u00a0This includes lending advice to legislative efforts, such as the one by Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) to\u00a0encourage tech companies to share disinformation data with one another\u00a0- and hopefully researchers.       </p><p>          Funder Craig Newmark, who has put more than $100 million into journalism and information security projects since 2016, said academics are an important part of shoring up defenses against foreign and domestic interference in 2020.       </p><p>          \"The best analysts aren't at government, they aren't at platforms - they're working at different parts of information warfare sector. They're individual researchers,\" said Newmark.\u00a0\"This is all hands on deck.\"       </p><p>             -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00a0on Wednesday praised the Justice Department's decision to launch a wide-reaching antitrust review of the tech industry.In a CNBC interview, Mnuchin expressed approval that the probe could target e-commerce giant Amazon.</p><p>\"I think if you look at Amazon, although there are certain benefits to it, they've destroyed the retail industry across the United States, so there's no question they've limited competition,\" Mnuchin\u00a0said. \"There's areas where [Amazon] really hurt small businesses.\"</p><p>The Justice Department probe will broadly investigate how major tech companies may have \"reduced competition, stifled innovation\u00a0or otherwise harmed consumers.\" While the agency did not name specific companies, Amazon, which is also facing an anti-competition probe in Europe, is a possible target.</p><p>President Trump has lashed out at Amazon, Google\u00a0and Facebook since he announced his administration was looking into potential antitrust violations by tech companies late last year. Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>             -- The lobbying group representing Uber is throwing its weight against federal legislation that could prove to be another wrench\u00a0in the company's fight to keep its workers classified as contractors. TechNet sent a letter to the House Education and Labor Committee ahead of today's hearing on\u00a0\"Protecting the Right to Organize Act,\" a bill that would modernize America's labor laws. In a letter shared with Technology 202, the group claims that \"a definitional test of what constitutes an employee as opposed to an independent contractor ... could have a chilling effect on the 'on-demand' or 'gig' economy.\" The group advocated for an industry exemption similar to the one it has been trying to negotiate in California, where legislation that could classify Uber and Lyft drivers as full-time employees is close to passing.</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Talent news at the intersection of the tech industry and Washington          </p><p>Today:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-de23fc3e7d9f4ea99e127f407b8eb82b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN7-1321-JB4M-V19G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1863\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The social network said the fine could be as high as $5 billion,\u00a0dwarfing the agency's previous record privacy civil penalty of a $22.5 million.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors appeared to accept the fine as a one-time cost of doing business as the company reported otherwise better-than-expected financial results. Both its quarterly revenue and total number of global users increased year-over-year --\u00a0even in the face of mounting scrutiny from policymakers around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The stock is up largely because the intrinsic performance of the business was better than anticipated,\" said Youssef Squali, head of Internet and Digital Media Research Group at SunTrust.</p><p>By preempting the FTC and announcing an estimate of the fine, Facebook could be trying to put more than a year of privacy scandals behind it, Squali said.</p><p>Facebook is facing a fine as it negotiates a settlement with the FTC that would conclude its year-long investigation into whether the company violated a previous privacy agreement\u00a0with the agency. The FTC opened the probe following the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, and in that time, the company has had repeated privacy transgressions, -- ranging from data breaches to failing to securely store users' passwords. At this time, the exact contours of the FTC probe remain unclear.</p><p>             But Big Tech's critics saw the Wall Street rally as an indication that even a record-setting fine would do little to draw blood from the social networking giant. The company's projection reignited concerns\u00a0the Washington agency\u00a0is not equipped to police one of the world's most valuable companies -- and prompted policymakers and advocates to call\u00a0for antitrust action or other penalties beyond fines.          </p><p>As many observers noted, even at the high end of the range Facebook estimated, the fine would only be a fraction of the nearly $56 billion in annual revenue Facebook reported in 2018.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), rekindled her calls to break up the company. (You can read our previous Technology 202 newsletter about Warren's plan to break up Big Tech here).</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, who heads the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said Congress may need to step in if the FTC's action amounts to a \"slap on the wrist.\" The Rhode Island Democrat previously called for the agency to investigate Facebook for antitrust violations. From his Twitter feed:</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said the predicted fine would be \"paltry\" in comparison to Facebook's profits last quarter, and he called for broad changes\u00a0within the business:</p><p>Tim Wu, the author of \"The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Guilded Age,\" said the fine should just be the beginning. He suggested the company should be required to sell off one of its major subsidiaries, WhatsApp.</p><p>To be sure, it was an unusual step for Facebook to preempt the FTC and announce the fine while negotiations with the agency are still ongoing. Facebook itself acknowledge\u00a0the matter is \"unresolved\u00a0and there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of any final outcome.\"</p><p>It's also very possible that any settlement\u00a0will come with the kinds of structural remedies that Blumenthal is calling for. My colleague Tony Romm reported last week that the federal regulators could seek new, heightened oversight of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. One idea that has been floated could require him or other executives to certify the company's privacy practices periodically to the board of directors.</p><p>Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist at the FTC, told the New York Times yesterday that any regulatory mandates -- curbing the company's\u00a0ability to share information with business partners or require it to disclose more information to consumers about how it collects data -- could pack a bigger punch than fines.</p><p>\"Those will have the most lasting impact on consumers' privacy,\" Soltani said.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The National Security Agency recommended the White House terminate a controversial surveillance program that collects data about Americans' phone calls and text messages,\u00a0according to the Wall Street Journal's Dustin Volz and Warren P. Strobel. The program, which started after the 9/11 attacks, ran into compliance challenges in recent years, and the legal and logistical costs of maintaining it may outweigh its benefits.\u00a0</p><p> \"The recommendation against seeking the renewal of the once-secret spying program amounts to an about-face by the agency, which had long argued in public and to congressional overseers that the program was vital to the task of finding and disrupting terrorism plots against the U.S.,\" the Wall Street Journal reported. \"The latest view is rooted in a growing belief among senior intelligence officials that the spying program provides limited value to national security and has become a logistical headache.\"</p><p>The legal compliance challenges forced the agency to halt use of the program earlier this year, and its legal authority will sunset in December without congressional action.\u00a0</p><p>The program started during the Bush administration, but the public became aware of it after former government contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents that exposed its existence to journalists nearly six years ago. That revelation, and others, ignited global backlash to American spying practices.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: An Amazon team responsible for auditing Alexa has access to users' location data, and in some instances, can find a user's home address,\u00a0according to Bloomberg's Matt Day, Giles Turner and Natalia Drozdiak. Bloomberg spoke with five employees familiar with the program.\u00a0</p><p> \"Team members with access to Alexa users' geographic coordinates can easily type them into third-party mapping software and find home residences, according to the employees, who signed nondisclosure agreements barring them from speaking publicly about the program,\" Bloomberg reported. \"While there's no indication Amazon employees with access to the data have attempted to track down individual users, two members of the Alexa team expressed concern to Bloomberg that Amazon was granting unnecessarily broad access to customer data that would make it easy to identify a device's owner.\"</p><p>Bloomberg's revelations follow its earlier report that Amazon employs thousands of people around the world to listen to voice recordings captured in Alexa devices in order to improve the digital assistant. Their efforts are intended to eliminate gaps in Alexa's understanding of speech and help it better respond to commands.\u00a0\u00a0At the time of that report, an Amazon spokesperson said \"employees do not have direct access to information that can identify the person or account as part of this workflow.\"</p><p>Amazon issued a new statement responding to the location data revelations, saying\u00a0\"access to internal tools is highly controlled, and is only granted to a limited number of employees who require these tools to train and improve the service by processing an extremely small sample of interactions. Our policies strictly prohibit employee access to or use of customer data for any other reason, and we have a zero tolerance policy for abuse of our systems. We regularly audit employee access to internal tools and limit access whenever and wherever possible.\"</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0Twitter sells itself as the digital public square. But a new study shows that in the United States, its users diverge from the general\u00a0population -- they're statistically younger, better-educated, richer and Democrat-leaning.          </p><p>The Pew Research study, which surveyed nearly 3,000 adult U.S. Twitter users, also\u00a0found that 10 percent of Twitter users produce 80 percent of the tweets. The top 10 percent send a median of 138 tweets a months, have 387 followers and follow 456. They're more than three times as likely to have tweeted about politics in the last 30 days, as compared to the bottom 90 percent.\u00a0</p><p>While most analysis of Twitter use is largely done by analyzing publicly available data, the Pew researchers required participants to both complete a survey and provide them with their Twitter handle.\u00a0</p><p>The data provides significant insight into how Americans are using Twitter as the service is driving much of the political conversation and news cycle, especially as President Trump leverages the service from the Oval Office in unprecedented ways. The study's authors, Stefan Wojcik and Adam Hughes, tell me it's important to highlight the delta between reality and what's happening on Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>\"The conversation that's happening on Twitter might not be the same one that's happening across America,\" Hughes said.\u00a0</p><p>             - Tech news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - Tech news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz online:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-3eae4ff39da14457ba4812019757019a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYT-NCC1-JB4M-V4GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1538\"/><timeReceived>1:02 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Just this week: A group seeking to ban facial recognition technology in Denver found it falsely matched Denver City Council members to people in the sex offender registry, in some instances with a confidence rating of 92 percent. And a New York Times review of hundreds of Florida police cases exposed that the software falls short in cases with grainy surveillance footage, and there's little oversight of how the police are using it. Its role in legal cases is not always disclosed to defendants.       </p><p>             Facial recognition has emerged as a rare issue in Washington that unites Republicans and Democrats, as lawmakers from both parties have             condemned\u00a0             the new technology as a potential threat to privacy and civil liberties. A recent flurry of efforts to restrict the software's use at the             city             and             state             level could put greater pressure on Washington to consider federal regulations.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The technology is being used in schools, grocery stores, airports, malls, theme parks, stadiums, and on our phones, social media platforms, doorbell camera footage, and even in hiring decision,\" Maloney said. \"This technology is completely unregulated at the federal level, resulting in some questionable and even dangerous applications.\"</p><p>Lawmakers are expected to discuss possible legislative solutions after a flurry of proposals introduced last year to rein in the software's use. Cummings last summer was reportedly working with Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the committee's top Republican, to introduce bipartisan legislation limiting funding for federal agencies to buy new facial recognition technology. Maloney told Politico in December that no bill text was written and the committee had to study the facts before moving forward.\u00a0</p><p>Lawmakers will today hear a wide range of perspectives on how they should regulate the software, as the witness list includes privacy and artificial ethics advocates including Brenda Leong, Future of Privacy Forum senior counsel; and Meredith Whittaker, the AI Now Institute co-founder. Industry representatives will also be on deck, with testimony from Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation; and Jake Parker, the Security Industry Association director of government relations.\u00a0</p><p>Expect a divided group: Whittaker will call for policymakers and businesses to halt all use of facial recognition in sensitive social situations and political contexts, according to a press release. But Castro will warn Congress to avoid bans on the technology and instead consider steps to improve oversight and accountability.\u00a0</p><p>\"Recent calls for bans or moratoriums on facial recognition are misguided and would have negative economic and social consequences,\" he will say. \"Even narrow bans can have unintended consequences, given the widespread integration of facial recognition technology in many products and services.\"</p><p>The committee is also expected to discuss a December National Institute of Standards Technology study, which found that facial recognition algorithms had higher rates of false positives for people of color relative to white faces. The landmark study found Asian and African Americans were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified than white men, depending on the particular algorithm and type of search. Charles Romine, NIST's Information Technology Laboratory director, is also a witness.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: President Trump attacked Apple on Twitter yesterday for refusing to help law enforcement \"unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers\u00a0and other violent criminal elements.\" The presidential condemnation comes as Attorney General William P. Barr is pressuring the company to help the FBI crack into two encrypted iPhones belonging to a gunman who killed three people at a Florida military base last month.\u00a0          </p><p>\"We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>What's at stake is a do-over of the 2016 legal battle during which the FBI asked a court to force Apple help it crack into an iPhone used by the San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Farook. It withdrew the request before a judge's ruling. At the time, Trump\u00a0urged a boycott of Apple.</p><p>CEO Tim Cook has already called on the company's top advisers to prepare for a new legal battle, Jack Nicas and Katie Benner at the New York Times report. Apple insists that it has cooperated with the investigation and maintains that weakening encryption for law enforcement could be exploited by bad actors.</p><p>The tweet marks a new turn in the tempestuous relationship between the tech giant and the White House. In November, Trump praised Apple for its Texas manufacturing plant and Tim Cook has served on the White House workforce advisory board.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Antitrust alone won't be enough to fix Big Tech, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren saidin a recent interview with the New York Times's Charlie Warzel.</p><p>\"I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side,\" she told Charlie. \"Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed.\"</p><p>\"I don't believe only antitrust works, but I do believe it's a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech,\" she added, responding to criticism from opponent Andrew Yang that her proposal was \"outdated.\"</p><p>Warren also spoke to her personal relationship with technology, saying that she was worried about privacy most when sending Snapchat messages to her granddaughters and texting with her family.</p><p>\"Who's watching and for what purposes? What kind of information are they scraping off and to use in what ways? It's wrong. We need to put a stop to it,\" she said.</p><p>             BYTES: Popular dating apps including Grindr, Tinder and OkCupid are sharing personal user data such as sexual preference and location to advertisers in a possible violation of privacy laws in California and Europe,\u00a0Natasha Singer and Aaron Krolik at the New York Times report.\u00a0</p><p>The findings come from a new report from the Norwegian Consumer Council, a nonprofit organization that recently filed three complaints against Grindr under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation law.</p><p>\"Any consumer with an average number of apps on their phone - anywhere between 40 and 80 apps - will have their data shared with hundreds or perhaps thousands of actors online,\" said Finn Myrstad, the digital policy director for the Norwegian Consumer Council.</p><p>American consumer groups are calling on regulators including the attorney general of California to investigate whether\u00a0Grindr and the other apps called out in the report could be in violation of federal and state laws as well, Natasha and Aaron report. Twitter suspended Grindr yesterday after the report revealed the company was sharing private user data with the social media platform's ad network.\u00a0</p><p>Grindr told the Times it had not received a copy of the report and could not comment specifically on the content.\u00a0</p><p>             - A bipartisan group of senators led by Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and ranking Democrat Mark Warner (Va.) introduced legislation yesterday that would deliver more than $1 billion to help develop and fund alternative next-generation 5G wireless technology to compete with China's Huawei and ZTE. Lawmakers and U.S. government officials have charged those companies are too beholden to the Chinese government and could be complicit in Beijing spying.\u00a0          </p><p>          \"The widespread adoption of 5G has the potential to transform the way we do business, but also carries significant national security risks,\" Burr said in a statement. \"Those risks could prove disastrous if Huawei, a company that operates at the behest of the Chinese government, military, and intelligence services, is allowed to take over the 5G market unchecked.\"       </p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-ec964053ccf746ea9a25680f97b5c598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0B-3SW1-JB4M-V2BX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1610\"/><timeReceived>1:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000184</classCode><className>BIOMETRICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

As\u00a0Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee grilled chief executive Sundar Pichai on anti-conservative bias in search results, Democrats dismissed such allegations as a \"fantasy\" and signaled they are serious about passing a privacy bill, getting tough on election security and curtailing disinformation campaigns. \u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Jerrold\u00a0Nadler, the ranking Democrat who will likely chair the House Judiciary Committee next year, accused Republicans of letting \"delusions of the far right\" distract them.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Unfortunately, in this our fourth hearing devoted to entirely fictitious allegations of conservative -- of anti-conservative bias of internet companies, we will waste more time and more taxpayer money and elevating well-worn right-wing conspiracy theories instead of concentrating the substantive questions and issues that should be the focus of our hearings,\" Nadler said.\u00a0\"Our committee can and must and will do better.\"</p><p>             A year of fiery exchanges in hearing rooms with Silicon Valley executives has not yet resulted in any meaningful new laws targeting Silicon Valley companies. Even Republicans' tough talk about political bias and\u00a0potential antitrust violations\u00a0has not translated to much action. Soon it'll be Democrats' turn, and they made clear they are turning a new page:\u00a0\"I look forward next year to working with you on some of the very serious questions we face,\" Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told Pichai. \"It's pretty obvious bias against conservative voices is not one of them.\"</p><p>             Tough privacy legislation is already emerging as a top priority. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) pressed Pichai\u00a0on whether it's time for a national privacy law and how it should compare to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.\u00a0</p><p>             Technology companies are ready to come to the table as an alternative to dealing with a\u00a0patchwork of state laws. Pichai said his company supports national privacy legislation --\u00a0and even indicated he would be open to something similar to GDPR in the United States. Calling it a \"well-crafted piece of legislation,\" Pichai said there is \"some value for companies to have consistent global regulation.\"</p><p>             Another issue likely to be top of mind for Democrats: Tougher mandates for companies to notify consumers when they are breached.\u00a0Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) asked Pichai how Americans can trust their personally identifiable information is safe with Google -- which\u00a0announced on Monday it had a security bug on its Google+ service that may have affected the personal information of about 52 million people. Earlier this year, lawmakers criticized the company for failing to disclose another security vulnerability for months, partially due to fears of regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Johnson pressed Pichai on whether Google was being transparent enough about its data security practices. \"We always think there is more to do,\" Pichai said.\u00a0\"It's an area which is going to be an ongoing area of effort for us.\"</p><p>             But lawmakers also have a lot of work to do. Democrats\u00a0have\u00a0big ambitions to crack down on technology companies, but\u00a0there wasn't a clear consensus on concrete steps they plan to take. And the exchanges with Pichai highlighted how they still seem to be learning about the issues, such as\u00a0content moderation.\u00a0</p><p>This lack of tech savvy means they are still not drilling down enough into the details to get real answers. It allowed Pichai\u00a0to largely sail through some of the toughest questions on privacy.\u00a0</p><p>             And Pichai was able to answer in broad terms without much follow up, such as when\u00a0lawmakers tried to address the\u00a0spread of conspiracy theories and hate speech on YouTube, a Google platform.\u00a0\u00a0Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland) asked if Google was prepared to keep up with the avalanche of hate-mongering theories, after\u00a0a recent Washington Post article\u00a0said YouTube continued to allow \"racists, anti-Semites and proponents of other extremist views to use the platform as an online library for spreading their ideas.\"</p><p>\"We do grapple with difficult issues, maybe we have to look at it on a video-by-video basis,\" Pichai said. \"It's our responsibility to make sure YouTube is a platform for freedom of expression but it's responsible and contributes positively to society.</p><p>             Pichai\u00a0did not offer much on election security, either. Swalwell asked what the company was doing to address Russian interference in the political system moving forward.\u00a0\"Our efforts have been pretty successful so far,\" Pichai said. \"But it's an area where it's never enough.\"</p><p>Republicans were not immune to this problem.\u00a0For instance, in a theatrical exchange, Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) held up his iPhone and asked Pichai if Google tracked his movements. Pichai got away with saying he couldn't answer the question because he didn't have enough information on his specific phone settings. However, Poe may have gotten more details if he tried to pin Pichai on\u00a0what kinds of\u00a0location data Google services collect on people's phones.</p><p>Bloomberg's Shira\u00a0Ovide\u00a0noted these broad\u00a0exchanges were not so helpful to solving complex problems:\u00a0</p><p>             But Democrats may get another chance soon, as they\u00a0are already calling for more hearings with Silicon Valley leaders.\u00a0Rep. David N. Cicilline\u00a0(D-R.I.), who will likely chair the antitrust subcommittee, says he wants Pichai back next year.\u00a0</p><p>             BITS:Pichai said in an interview with The Post after the hearing that Google is engaged in an internal effort to develop a product for China -- and it might not be a search engine. \"For us, this work had many purposes. Can we explore and serve users in China, in areas like education and health care?\" he said. \"We may not end up doing search. We're trying to understand a market.\"</p><p>During the hearing, lawmakers from both parties warned Pichai about developing a search engine that would abide by China's censorship regime, The Post's Tony Romm and Craig Timberg reported. \"Pichai, who acknowledged in questioning from lawmakers that roughly 100 people have worked on the project but repeatedly said Google currently has 'no plans' to offer a new product for China, later told the Post that it was too soon to put any parameters on the effort.\"</p><p>Cicilline asked Pichai\u00a0if he would \"rule out launching a tool for surveillance and censorship in China\" while he serves as chief executive of Google. Pichai\u00a0would not, saying instead\u00a0it is the company's mission\u00a0\"to explore possibilities to give users access to information.\" Cicilline later told Bloomberg he was \"disappointed\" with Google's\u00a0\u00a0answers on China.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: Outgoing House Committee Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte still thinks Google is biased against conservatives, saying Pichai's\u00a0testimony on the issue \"was not very helpful.\" In an interview with Bloomberg, he\u00a0pointed to an incident earlier this year where the search engine labeled the California Republican Party as Nazis\u00a0as an example of the problem.\u00a0\"Whether it's systemic bias or simply a flaw in their algorithms, it's a serious issue they need to address,\" Goodlatte said.\u00a0</p><p>             Pichai sought to dispel claims that Google harbors bias against conservative views and content on its platforms.\u00a0\"Pichai insisted that Google is careful to avoid political bias in its search engine and other products,\"\u00a0Tony and Craig reported\u00a0from the hearing. But Republican lawmakers were not persuaded.\u00a0From Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.):\u00a0\"The muting of conservative voices by Internet platforms has intensified, especially during the presidency of Donald Trump.\"</p><p>In order to counter claims that Google engineers manipulate online search results,\u00a0 Lofgren, a Democrat, also asked Pichai to explain why a photo of Trump appeared in the results after she entered the word \"idiot\" in the company's image search engine:</p><p>             BYTES: Though lawmakers displayed a better grasp on technology issues than at the April hearing with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, they still had a few questions that seemed better suited for tech support than for the leader of one of the world's most valuable companies.\u00a0          </p><p>             After Rep. Steve\u00a0King (R-Iowa) voiced concerns about a photo\u00a0and comments that appeared on his\u00a0granddaughter's iPhone as she was playing a game on the device,\u00a0Pichai replied: \"Congressman, iPhone is made by a different company.\" King then said that\u00a0\"it might have been an Android. It's just, it was a hand-me-down of some kind.\"</p><p>             And Pichai's answer that Google would need to know more about Rep. Poe's phone settings to answer his questions about location tracking did not sit well with the congressman.\u00a0\"It's not a trick question,\" Poe said.\u00a0\"You know, you make $100 million a year. You ought to be able to answer that question.\"</p><p>From BuzzFeed News's\u00a0Eric Morrow:</p><p>From my colleague Tony:</p><p>Rep.

But the hearing will also be a test for lawmakers.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Previous high-profile hearings with Silicon Valley executives have revealed lawmakers' own knowledge gaps about how technology services work and make money. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's April testimony, for instance, highlighted how some didn't have a grasp on how social networks work.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As The Washington Post's humor columnist Alexandra Petri wrote at the time:\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tuesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing with Google, under fire from some Republican lawmakers who allege the search engine has anti-conservative bias, may be an even bigger challenge, according to Drew Margolin, a Cornell University professor.</p><p>\"After Congress struggled to understand how Facebook operated, and thus what its responsibilities ought to be, we should expect even more confusion in testimony from Google,\" Margolin,\u00a0who studies the way people communicate online,\u00a0said in an email. \"Social networks sites are a recent invention, but the basic concept of what they do is intuitive to human beings, whereas search engines are much more complex, which makes their public responsibility much harder to gauge.\"</p><p>             Lawmakers are promising to get tougher on Big Tech, but the gulf of technical knowledge between the Beltway and Silicon Valley may stand in the way. For years, technologists have pointed to what they see as uninformed remarks\u00a0as a major impediment to engaging with Washington -\u00a0arguing that politicians may hold back innovation if they attempt to regulate services they don't understand.          </p><p>             Now that tech leaders are at the table, lawmakers are under more pressure\u00a0to get up to speed and actually hold them accountable. Especially since lawmakers are promising to tackle a broad swath of\u00a0tech issues next Congress, including\u00a0the spread of disinformation campaigns online, election security\u00a0and consumer privacy.\u00a0</p><p>             The proof will be in the pudding on Tuesday,\u00a0since some Republicans make serious allegations against Google.\u00a0Even\u00a0President\u00a0Trump tweeted that Google's search results were \"RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD\"\u00a0over the summer. Trump's top economic adviser\u00a0said the administration was looking into whether the tech titan's search results should be regulated, stoking concerns on both sides of the aisle -- and in Silicon Valley.\u00a0</p><p>The company has denied the charges of bias. As\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm\u00a0noted, the issue is complex: \"Google\u00a0processes 90 percent of searches globally, and its powerful algorithms return results based on their calculated relevance, a process Google portrays as neutral. Google takes into account signals including a user's geographic location and browsing history, which is why Trump's search results look different from what another user might see. Social media platforms differ from a search because information on social media is circulated through friends and brands that users choose to follow.\"\u00a0</p><p>Lawmakers will take the opportunity on Tuesday to publicly press Pichai on a host of other tensions, including disinformation, data security and the company's plans to push into China.</p><p>Since the Office of Personnel Management breach was announced in\u00a02015,\u00a0members of Congress have had to tackle technology issues with increasing\u00a0frequency, says James Norton, a former Department of Homeland Security official focused on legislative affairs.\u00a0But he says senior members of Congress on both sides of the aisle aren't owning technology issues.\u00a0\"Members are still pretty unprepared on most of the committees,\" Norton said. \"We keep seeing the can being kicked.\"</p><p>             But some in the technology industry say Silicon Valley could do more to bridge this gap. Microsoft President Brad Smith is meeting with lawmakers to talk about regulating facial-recognition technology, and he said people in the tech sector make the mistake of underestimating how knowledgeable people in government have become about technology issues.</p><p>\"If people don't know everything they need to know, it's not because they're not curious, it's not because they're not smart,\" Smith said. \"It's because nobody shared the information with them. So let's share the information so we can all talk together with the right comparable level of knowledge.\"</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Dozens of companies are receiving people's precise location data via apps on their phones, and they're selling it or using it to gain insights into consumer behavior,according to the New York Times's Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Natasha Singer, Michael H. Keller and Aaron Krolik. Even though the companies say the location data is anonymous and not tied to a person's name or phone number, the Times reporters say employees or clients with access to the raw data could still identify a person without their permission. The reporters proved it by tying anonymized location data from a database of more than a million phones to a New York woman without knowing her name.</p><p>It's not a surprise to most consumers that their location data is being collected by services on their phones, but the Times reports \" as smartphones have become ubiquitous and technology more accurate, an industry of snooping on people's daily habits has spread and grown more intrusive.\" From advertisers to hedge funds, many businesses want a piece of the $21 billion location-targeted ad market. The Times found the explanations of how companies use and sell the data are often buried in lengthy privacy policies.</p><p>             \"Location information can reveal some of the most intimate details of a person's life - whether you've visited a psychiatrist, whether you went to an A.A. meeting, who you might date,\" Sen.\u00a0Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told the Times. Wyden has proposed bills to curb the collection and sale of location data.</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Justice Department is investigating fake comments about net neutrality that were posted on the Federal Communications Commission's website starting in April 2017, BuzzFeed\u00a0News reports.\u00a0Two organizations\u00a0told BuzzFeed News's\u00a0Kevin Collier and\u00a0Jeremy Singer-Vine\u00a0that they received subpoenas from the FBI. \"More than 20 million comments have since appeared on the site, with the New York attorney general's office estimating that up to 9.5 million of those were filed in people's names without their consent,\" Collier and\u00a0Singer-Vine wrote.</p><p>The Justice Department isn't acting alone - the New York attorney general's office has also been probing the matter.\u00a0BuzzFeed News also reported that the offices of the attorneys general of Massachusetts and the District\u00a0are supporting the New York state investigation. The two organizations that received subpoenas from the FBI\u00a0\"had previously been subpoenaed by New York and said the scope of those subpoenas were similar,\" according to Collier and Singer-Vine.</p><p>             BYTES: The electric-scooter winter is here.\u00a0Companies Bird and Lime have scaled back their valuation goals as investors'\u00a0enthusiasm subsides,according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Eliot Brown, Greg Bensinger and Katie Roof. Bird\u00a0\"is planning to take on more investment at its current $2 billion valuation\" and Lime told\u00a0\"investors it expects to raise at a valuation of between $2 billion and $3 billion, below the roughly $4 billion it previously indicated to investors it was seeking,\" the Journal\u00a0reported.</p><p>The companies also face additional hurdles such as vandalism as well as competition. \"One issue is scooters not designed for heavy use are breaking down quickly,\" the Journal\u00a0reported. \"In some markets, scooters last about two months, investors said, often less time than it takes to recoup the purchase cost. Another is vandalism, glorified on social media through video clips of people knocking over rows of scooters or throwing them off parking garages.\" Nevertheless, Bird and Lime's\u00a0\"valuations are still lofty-neither company is yet two years old-and the industry has plenty of backers.\"          </p><p>             - The race between Uber and Lyft to go public heated up as Uber\u00a0confidentially filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday for an initial public offering,the New York Times's\u00a0Mike Isaac, Kate Conger and Erin Griffith reported. Lyft\u00a0also announced Thursday that it had confidentially filed a draft registration statement\u00a0with the SEC to go public.\u00a0\"Each company is rushing to beat the other to the public markets in the first half of next year amid a fair climate for technology I.P.O.s             and worries of a potential economic recession.\"          </p><p>Uber is a larger company than\u00a0Lyft, but as the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Greg Bensinger and Maureen Farrell noted, both firms\u00a0are unprofitable.\u00a0\"For its presentations to potential investors, Uber is likely to emphasize the success of its side projects such as prepared-food-delivery unit UberEats and trucking business Freight, people familiar with the matter have said,\" they wrote. \"It operates in about 70 countries world-wide, while Lyft is just in the U.S. and Canada.\"          </p><p>             - Medical cannabis businesses in Maryland seek to navigate the gray areas of Facebook and Instagram's guidelines to avoid losing their accounts. Both platforms\u00a0allow education and advocacy for marijuana but ban content that promotes marijuana sales, The Washington Post's\u00a0Steve Thompson reported. \"That means no advertising discounts or listing prices, nor mentioning there is product for sale,\" my colleague wrote. \"The platforms prohibit marijuana dispensaries from providing their phone numbers or street addresses.\" Medical cannabis sales started a year ago in Maryland.</p><p>Steve found that Instagram shut down five accounts that should have remained online.\u00a0\"The Washington Post sent Instagram 16 accounts created by Maryland cannabis sellers that had been wiped out for supposed violations,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"The company responded that 11 had been appropriately removed. But five had been shut down in error, and the company restored them Thursday.\"          </p><p>             - A report released by the\u00a0Virginia Chamber Foundation said the arrival of Amazon's offices in Northern Virginia will result in $15 billion in new economic activity by 2030 in the D.C. area, The Post's\u00a0Patricia Sullivan reported.\u00a0The\u00a0offices in Crystal City -\u00a0which Amazon chose alongside Long Island City in New York\u00a0for its new headquarters\u00a0-\u00a0will also lead to 62,000 new jobs in the\u00a0area, according to the report, my colleague noted. The study\u00a0\"said operations of the Amazon offices alone will produce an estimated annual $6.4 billion from 2019 to 2030, supporting an average 27,928 jobs each year in the region,\" Patricia wrote. \"The total impact, which includes spinoff businesses and those that arise to serve the new employees, will be more than twice that, the report said.\" (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

But that was after lawmakers from both parties had warned the company about the serious national security and privacy implications of Dragonfly, which they said could make the company complicit in the Chinese government's human rights abuses and surveillance practices.</p><p>             Any indication that Google is actually continuing to work on the project in secret could damage the company's position in Washington or even prompt new congressional inquiries.          </p><p>After all, Google promised to be upfront with policymakers about\u00a0plans to enter the China market. Google chief executive\u00a0Sundar Pichai said during a December hearing\u00a0the company would \"fully transparent,\" including with policymakers, if the company ever did pursue search in China.\u00a0</p><p>             But it appears the search giant has been unable to convince its own employees that it will keep that commitment. Google employees began monitoring the company's internal systems for information about the project, keeping tabs on repositories of code that were linked to Dragonfly, according to the Intercept.</p><p>As the Intercept's Ryan Tate notes, it's an extraordinary step for Google's own employees to launch a probe into the project, one that underscores how concerned they are about the company's secrecy.</p><p>The employees said there were more than 400 changes to the code between January and February of this year - which they told the Intercept indicates continued development on Dragonfly. They also say there are about 100 workers still allocated to the \"cost center\" associated with Dragonfly.</p><p>Google sources with knowledge of Dragonfly told the Intercept that the code changes could also be attributed to employees who have continued to wrap up aspects of the work they were doing.</p><p>             New questions about Dragonfly only add to the firestorm Google is facing in Washington over human rights. A group of lawmakers called on the company last week to remove a Saudi government app that allows men to track women's locations from its app store. However,\u00a0 Insider reports the company is refusing to do so on the grounds that it does not violate its terms of service.</p><p>Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), one of the lawmakers who called on Google to delete the app, criticized the company on Twitter:</p><p>             BITS: Google conducted a pay analysis that revealed that the company was underpaying more men than women for similar work as lower-level software engineers,\u00a0The Washington Post's Hamza Shaban reported. The specific number of men at Google who received additional compensation as a result of the study was not disclosed, but the company said in a\u00a0blog post\u00a0that it gave\u00a0$9.7 million in adjustments to\u00a010,677 employees. The 2018 pay study encompassed 91 percent of Google employees.</p><p>The tech industry has faced repeated criticism for its lack of diversity. Google said the analysis doesn't provide a full picture of the way women and minorities who are underrepresented are paid, my colleague reported.\u00a0\"Our pay equity analysis ensures that compensation is fair for employees in the same job, at the same level, location and performance.

The Federal Communications Commission scrapped Obama-era rules that prohibited\u00a0Internet providers from slowing down, blocking or prioritizing content on the Internet.\u00a0House Democrats will work with Democrats in the Senate\u00a0to pass a bill called Save The Internet Act to reinstate net neutrality rules, Pelosi said in a letter to Democratic members of the House.</p><p>             \"The Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, voted in May 2018 to reinstate the net neutrality rules, but the House did not take up the issue before Congress adjourned last year,\"\u00a0Shepardson wrote. \"A U.S. federal appeals court last month held lengthy oral arguments in a legal challenge to the FCC's decision to repeal the net neutrality rules.\"</p><p>             BYTES: The campaigns of Democratic presidential candidates\u00a0Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are turning to the same online platform\u00a0developed in the aftermath of the 2016 election\u00a0to better organize volunteers, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Julie Bykowicz reported. MobilizeAmerica, a two-year-old company founded by Democratic preidential campaign veterans Alfred Johnson and\u00a0Allen Kramer,\u00a0 creates a centralized system that allows volunteers sign up for shifts calling voters or door-knocking.\u00a0</p><p>The political parties are constantly in campaign tech arms race, and MobilizeAmerica could be the Democrats' answer to the broad data-swapping system that Republicans deployed in 2016.

Farenthold and Jonathan O'Connell. Executives have spent about $195,000 at the property since then.</p><p>That paid for \"meeting space, catering, business center services, audio/visual equipment rental [and] lodging,\" according to a letter from Anthony Russo, T-Mobile USA's vice president of federal legislative affairs. That's about 14 percent of T-Mobile's $1.4 million in total corporate spending on D.C.-area hotels during the 10-month period, Russo said. About half of that was spent at Hilton hotels, he noted.</p><p>The letter was a response to a request from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.). (My colleagues initially reported in January that the day after the mega-deal was announced, 9 executives had reservations at the hotel).</p><p>- Major tech companies like Google and Facebook were once top sponsors at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Now Big Tech is the \"boogeyman,\"according to the New York Times's Michael M.

The Glass-Steagall Act enacted in 1933 in effect separated commercial banking from investment banking. Cicilline said regulation\u00a0might be necessary to increase competition in the tech industry.\u00a0\"This could work, he said, by forcing social media companies to run their platforms entirely separately from the parts of their business that sell customer data,\" the Financial Times reported.          </p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - A group of working mothers at Amazon\u00a0want the company to offer backup day care, Bloomberg News's\u00a0Spencer Soper and Rebecca Greenfield reported.

But the clock is ticking as the 2020 election approaches and threatens to dominate the political debate in Washington.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's bipartisan consensus that Washington needs to do more to protect consumers' data, and even that\u00a0companies such as\u00a0Facebook, Google and Amazon\u00a0may be becoming too powerful. But expect to see partisan divisions over how to tackle those issues that could limit real action in a divided Congress.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With Congress back in Washington this week, here's how lawmakers plan to keep the pressure on Big Tech:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             1. Pushing on a national privacy law.\u00a0Lawmakers have yet to reach a consensus despite optimism that 2019 would be the year Congress finally got its act together to pass a bill to protect consumers' date.\u00a0</p><p>Congressional lawmakers have just a few months left to pass a federal privacy bill before California's sweeping state privacy law takes effect in 2020. Businesses in the technology sector and beyond are intensifying their lobbying efforts to pressure Congress to act due to fears they could soon face a patchwork of different privacy state laws that would be difficult to comply with. Several members of the powerful lobbying group Business Roundtable -- including Amazon, IBM and Salesforce -- wrote a letter\u00a0yesterday to congressional leaders asking them to create \"strong, consistent protections\" for American consumers. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)</p><p>There are several\u00a0of privacy bills floating on both sides of the aisle, but few proposals have gained traction.\u00a0A bipartisan group in the Senate Commerce Committee that was seen as one of the most promising efforts to pass privacy legislation stalled earlier this summer. The committee's chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and ranking Democrat Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) remain in ongoing negotiations.\u00a0</p><p> \"We're closer, we're closer,\" Wicker told Politico's John Hendel. \"We're having very positive negotiations, we are moving in the right direction.\"\u00a0</p><p>             2.\u00a0Intensifying antitrust scrutiny through hearings in both chambers.\u00a0There's a push for lawmakers to complete a broad\u00a0investigation of competition in the tech industry\u00a0before the 2020 race heats up, but don't hold your breath for any actual legislation to pass until after the election.\u00a0</p><p>There will be more tech antitrust hearings to come led by the House antitrust subcommittee, which is chaired by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) One of the first\u00a0 topics the committee will be eying is the role of data and privacy in competition and antitrust issues. The committee was scheduled to hold a hearing on that issue tomorrow, but it was just postponed.\u00a0</p><p>In the Senate, top Republicans such as Sen. Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) say to expect a more measured approach. The Senate Judiciary Committee will be hosting several related hearings, including one examining mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry later this month.\u00a0</p><p>It's likely Congress will move slowly on antitrust, but lawmakers could play a key role in oversight of the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which have opened antitrust investigations into Silicon Valley companies. The Senate Judiciary Committee will also host a hearing on the oversight of the enforcement of antitrust laws next week.\u00a0</p><p>             3. Scrutinizing Section 230, tech's prized legal shield that grants companies broad immunity for content third parties post on their platforms.\u00a0But expect partisan divisions to persist over why it needs to change.\u00a0There have been growing calls from both parties to reform the section of the Communications Decency Act, which ensures that people cannot bring lawsuits against the tech companies for the content third parties post on their platforms. Recent mass shootings that began with gunmen posting hateful screeds on platforms like 8chan have raised new questions\u00a0among Democrats about whether the tech companies should be more responsible for violent content on their sites.\u00a0</p><p>Republicans are also interested in reviewing Section 230 -- but for very different reasons.\u00a0Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has pushed forward a bill that would create new limitations on the legal shield to address\u00a0accusations that the companies are biased against conservatives.\u00a0His proposal was widely criticized by tech policy experts, and there is no evidence that the companies are systematically biased against one political party. And regardless of party, social media companies will be on the defensive about any changes to Section 230.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The California Senate passed a bill that could convert hundreds of thousands of contract workers such as Uber and Lyft drivers in the state to employee status, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui writes.\u00a0The bill, known as AB5, has pitted Obama-era officials who have joined tech companies in advisory roles against high-profile progressives who believe the bill is in line with their efforts to address economic inequality.\u00a0</p><p>The tensions within the bill were highlighted last month when freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) attacked former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) in a tweet\u00a0for writing an op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle that criticized some aspects of AB5.\u00a0Former \"officials should not become corporate lobbyists, in letter or spirit. It's an abuse of power + a stain on public service,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter. \"We're supposed to fight FOR working people, not against them.\"</p><p>The debate is also likely to play out on the 2020 campaign trail. Faiz reports that presidential candidate\u00a0and former vice president Joe Biden declined to take a position on AB5 after multiple inquiries from The Post. But more liberal candidates such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have come out in support of the legislation.\u00a0</p><p>AB5 now goes back to the state assembly before it goes to the governor's desk for a signature. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who is widely viewed as a business-friendly politician, surprised many Uber and Lyft executives when he threw his support behind the bill earlier this month.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: The Federal Trade Commisssion is interviewing merchants that sell products on Amazon to determine whether the company is abusing its power to thwart competition,Bloomberg's Spencer Soper and Ben Brody write.\u00a0</p><p>Several attorneys and at least one economist are conducting the interviews, which last an average of 90 minutes.\u00a0One merchant, Jaivin Karnani, told Bloomberg he was surprised the FTC returned his call the next day. The FTC officials are asking all of the merchants what percentage of their sales are coming from Amazon versus other ecommerce companies like eBay or Walmart, signaling the regulators are skeptical of Amazon's repeated claims that suppliers have many alternatives.\u00a0</p><p> \"The interviews indicate the agency is in the early stages of a sweeping probe to learn how Amazon works, spot practices that break the law and identify markets dominated by the company,\" Spencer and Ben write. \"The length of the interviews and the manpower devoted to examining Amazon point to a serious inquiry rather than investigators merely responding to complaints and going through the motions, antitrust experts say.\"</p><p>Amazon hasn't disclosed an investigation by\u00a0the FTC, and it's rare for the agency to acknowledge scrutiny of individual companies. But FTC chairman Joe Simons told Bloomberg in August that he wanted to hear from third-party Amazon sellers about their experience using the platform. My colleague Tony Romm previously reported that Amazon could face heighted scrutiny from the FTC following an agreement between the agencies.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Danish politician Margrethe Vestager will continue her role as the European Commission's competition chief in addition to taking on\u00a0expanded responsibilities in a new role as executive vice president for digital,reports Mark Scott at Politico. In her five years at Europe's top antitrust watchdog, Vestager has launched multiple investigations into American tech giants including Apple, Google and Facebook, slamming them with a collective billions of dollars in fines. Vestager will also focus on data privacy in her new role and shaping standards for the region, something that could put her in conflict with national privacy watchdogs already on the beat, Mark reports.</p><p>In her new role, Vestager will also take on coordinating Europe's position on digital taxes - a topic that has created tension between the United States and allies France and Great Britain, both of which launched efforts to tax digital companies. While France and the United States\u00a0have reached an unsteady compromise for now, Vestager's new role could accelerate efforts in the region. Trump has previously criticized Vestager for going after U.S. tech companies.</p><p>             -- Lyft will introduce a number of new safety features, including mandatory community safety education and a check-in feature for trips that go off course,my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports. The changes come in response to growing criticism over the company's handling of user safety, including a recent lawsuit by 14 women alleging the company didn't do enough to prevent their sexual assaults by drivers.</p><p>Nearly a dozen women spoke with Faiz last month describing the company's response to allegations of sexual harassment as inadequate and lambasting it for lacking a panic button for users to report immediate danger. Now, users' location and vehicle information, such as license plate numbers, will be displayed alongside a 911 integration so users can more easily report their trips to dispatchers. The feature is similar to the panic button Uber has had on its app for over a year.</p><p>\"The onus is on all of us to learn from any incident, whether it occurs on our platform or not, and then work to help prevent them,\" Lyft President John Zimmer said in a statement on the company's website. But critics are still skeptical: Michael Bomberger, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuits cases against Lyft, called the announcement a \"cheap public relations stunt.\"</p><p>             - More news from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>                          -- The Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity has launched a campaign to urge state attorneys general to not turn recently launched probes into Facebook and Google \"into a political spectacle,\" the group shared with The Technology 202. The campaign highlights a divide in conservative attitudes toward growing antitrust sentiment between groups wary of government regulation and those who see enforcement as a tool against alleged conservative bias in Big Tech.                    </p><p>          \"There are serious consequences to abusing this kind of enforcement that create troubling ripple effects for American workers and families.\"\u00a0Americans for Prosperity senior tech policy analyst\u00a0Billy Easley said in a statement.\u00a0\"The AGs involved should not use this investigation as a means to score political points.\"       </p><p>          The ads, which will begin running in nine states on Facebook today, will encourage citizens to contact their state attorneys general and ask them to center the probe \"on real, measurable consumer harm and anticompetitive practices\" such as price fixing and collusion. The campaign follows a similar push in March to encourage lawmakers to reject Sen. Warren's proposal to break up big tech companies.       </p><p>          The group hopes to expand the digital ads to 36 states over the next two weeks, but did not disclose how much it's investing in the campaign.       </p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             - Coming soon:          </p><p>Apple on Tuesday unveiled new cheaper watches and iPhones and refreshed entry-level iPad.

Even as the photo-sharing app steadily amassed power and users, executives from Instagram have largely avoided the regulatory glare, Frier writes.\u00a0</p><p>Frier's book aims to pull back the curtain on Facebook's controversial acquisition of Instagram - and its true costs.</p><p>The account could have major implications as Washington probes Big Tech's power and top lawmakers revisit the deal to understand whether current antitrust law is up to the task of policing the tech industry.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram for about $1 billion is one of the most famous deals in Silicon Valley history - and perhaps one of the best bargains. Frier writes the company would be worth north of $100 billion if it were a stand-alone business today, per analyst estimates. Yet it sailed through with little opposition from Washington regulators - whom Frier argues were short-sighted about the potential Instagram and Facebook had for big growth.</p><p>Frier joined me to talk about what Washington policymakers can learn from her book. Here's our interview, lightly edited for length and clarity.\u00a0</p><p>             The Technology 202: What do you think regulators in the U.S. and the U.K. missed when they were reviewing Facebook's acquisition of Instagram?\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p>             Sarah Frier: They didn't understand the network effect. They didn't understand that Instagram was already winning in its category. When Facebook presented a lot of the background to regulators about the deal, they talked about how Instagram was just one of many photo-sharing apps. And therefore, there was no reason to believe that it was like two winners joining up together.\u00a0       </p><p>          What [Facebook chief executive Mark] Zuckerberg understood is once you got enough people to be on a network, you can make money off them eventually. He knew that even though Instagram did not have a business model. And even though Facebook on mobile advertising was very nascent, that eventually it would be fine because all you need to get started in the social media business is the human attention.\u00a0       </p><p>             You write in the book that antitrust laws were not written for the Instagram deal. Why not? And what do you think lawmakers should consider as they're conducting this broad antitrust review in Washington right now?\u00a0          </p><p>          What the antitrust law looks at is consumer harm, especially financial harm. For the Facebook-Instagram deal, what they're really getting a monopoly on is our time on the Internet and our attention. I don't think that there's a really good way to articulate what that power means for people and what it costs them.\u00a0       </p><p>          One of the things that I reveal at the end of the book is that by combining Facebook and Instagram more deeply and by asking the Instagram folks to have their problems solved through a central Facebook team, Instagram became a second priority, or even third or fourth priority for Facebook. That is the cost.       </p><p>Instagram co-founder and former chief executive Kevin Systrom never had to appear on Capitol Hill even after people learned that there was Russian influence on Instagram during the 2016 election. Why do you think Instagram hasn't faced the same amount of scrutiny as Facebook on that issue?          </p><p>          That's one of the biggest benefits of being part of Facebook.\u00a0       </p><p>          If Instagram was not part of Facebook, you would certainly be seeing Kevin Systrom on the stand. You would certainly be seeing more people interrogating the product and its impact on our society. Facebook is such a lightning rod, and because of that, it's always been strategic for Facebook to take most of the fall here, even when that Senate report in 2018 came out explaining that Russia, in fact, posted more on Instagram than they did on Facebook. It barely gained any traction.\u00a0       </p><p>          I think one reason besides Instagram's ownership by Facebook is also because people had a good feeling about Instagram, that it had a better brand.\u00a0       </p><p>             Is there an advantage for Facebook to tie all of its brands together as it faces more antitrust scrutiny?\u00a0          </p><p>          I think it helps with the regulatory scrutiny in many ways, because, first of all, Facebook can give one answer to governments when they're asked about their data policy, when they're asked about their content. They can say this is the policy for all of Facebook and this is how we handle it across all of these apps. So they can have one representation. It also helps in terms of making the argument that Facebook is not an organization of distinct apps, but actually just one main network. And the call to break Facebook up, it would just be so complicated. The more regulators wait to do it, the more integrated Facebook will become.       </p><p>Instagram's new head, Adam Mosseri, ran Newsfeed for Facebook and your book explains he was one of the first executives to warn about misinformation in 2016. What does his leadership mean for the way Instagram handles misinformation?\u00a0          </p><p>          The problem with treating Instagram's problems as a subset of Facebook is that Instagram works completely differently than Facebook. Instead of having mutual friendships, you have a follower model where anyone can follow anyone. Instead of having a requirement to use real names, you have anonymity. Instead of having virality of content, you have no re-sharing on Instagram. In fact, it's the accounts that end up getting attention and fame instead of the content itself. And so all of those things have different implications for how you would police it.\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>          And so I think that there should be different ways to solve problems with Instagram.\u00a0       </p><p>             As someone who's been watching the company for so long, how do you think the coronavirus is changing Instagram?          </p><p>          Previously, Instagram was this place to host the most optimistic, aspirational version of your life.\u00a0 Now it's more about connection with other people and less about the show. We're seeing a lot of live video, we're seeing a lot of direct messaging become more popular.\u00a0       </p><p>Lawmakers are raising concerns that Amazon might have lied to Congress about its handling of competing sellers' data.</p><p>Democrats want an explanation from the company after The Wall Street Journal's Dana Mattioli and Ryan Tracey reported that the company siphoned off data from sellers to design its own competing products. The practices described in the report are at odds with the company's testimony to Congress during an antitrust hearing in July. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)       </p><p>\"At best, Amazon's witness appears to have misrepresented key aspects of Amazon's business practices while omitting important details in response to pointed questioning,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee,\u00a0said in a statement to Politico's Cristiano Lima. \"At worst, the witness Amazon sent to speak on its behalf may have lied to Congress.\"\u00a0</p><p>Other leading Democrats also joined in, accusing the company of misleading lawmakers:</p><p>Amazon employees used sophisticated data about             best-selling             items sold by third-party sellers to set prices and decide on production for Amazon's in-house brands, Dana found in interviews with more than 20 former employees and one current employee. In some cases, Amazon based its product research on items that were sold almost exclusively by one company despite maintaining it doesn't use the sales data of individual sellers for research.       </p><p>Amazon told Dana it strictly prohibits the behavior described by employees. Amazon also maintains it doesn't use the sales data of individual sellers for research.\u00a0</p><p>President Trump could use a plan to overhaul the U.S. Postal Service to raise prices for Amazon.\u00a0</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told senior U.S. Postal Service officials that he would approve a $10 billion loan for the agency as leverage for influence over its delivery fees, my colleagues Jacob Bogage and Lisa Rein report. The talks are preliminary.\u00a0          </p><p>             Trump has argued e-commerce services such as Amazon are exploiting the Postal Service - and the loan could give him an opportunity to intervene. Trump previously urged the Postal Service to double its rates for Amazon, but the agency has defended its contract with the company.\u00a0</p><p>             But higher rates could do more to hurt than help the Postal Service by artificially raising its price above those of UPS and FedEx, analysts tell my colleagues. Amazon would also be heavily affected, but has already shifted toward doing its own last-mile deliveries more frequently.</p><p>A Treasury spokesman said it was too early to comment on the terms of the loan. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Postal Service has struggled financially in recent years, and it says without the coronavirus relief money it may not be able to make payroll and continue mail service uninterrupted past September. \u00a0</p><p>Trump suggested that the Department of Homeland Security research whether injecting isopropyl alcohol into people with the coronavirus could cure them - without citing any medical evidence. Amazon sellers took note. My colleague Amber Phillips:</p><p>             Trump campaign staffers are sharing a fake Joe Biden ad online.\u00a0          </p><p>The ad appears to have originated from a unverified user and has gone viral with the amplification of Trump staffers, the Verge's Makena Kelly reports. The Biden campaign confirmed that the ad, which displays Joe Biden's heart lighting up and has the campaign logo, is fake. Twitter did not respond to the Verge's request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Trump's reelection campaign, tweeted the faked ad without its original source asking whether it was legitimate. \"Can't trust Twitter, but this would seem to be the Biden campaign leaning in on the fact that ol' Joe has lost his fastball,\" he added.       </p><p>             The Biden campaign criticized Trump staffers for spreading the image. \u00a0          \"While the President continues to assail our free press as 'fake news' - once again it is his campaign spreading lies and disinformation,\" Bill Russo, deputy communications director for the Biden campaign, told Makena.\u00a0\"Sadly, we don't expect any better from the Trump Campaign as they get increasingly desperate.\"</p><p>Twitter's handling of the fake ad could spark more debate over what qualifies as manipulated media for election-related content.          </p><p>Facebook allowed advertisers to target users interested in pseudoscience even as it combated coronavirus misinformation.</p><p>Advertisers could target more than 78 million people the company marked as interested in \"pseudoscience,\" Aaron Sankin at the Markup found.\u00a0</p><p>The Markup was able to post an ad targeting the audience and get it approved in minutes. Facebook took down the category after the Markup reached out about the category.\u00a0</p><p>             It's unclear how many advertisers used the category, which could provide a potent tool for users seeking to spread misinformation about the coronavirus. For instance, Aaron received one ad for a hat from a company called Lambs claiming to protect wearers from cellphone radiation - which conspiracy theorists have linked to the virus.\u00a0</p><p>\"Lambs has never made any connection between 5G and COVID-19,\" chief executive Menard de Calenge told Aaron. He insisted that company hadn't selected the pseudoscience category. \u00a0       </p><p>Facebook has approved coronavirus misinformation ads in the past, Consumer Reports found. And despite Facebook's promises to crack down on misinformation, t             he Markup was able to find at least 67 user-created groups whose names indicate coronavirus conspiracy content. \u00a0Facebook spokesperson Devon Kearns said it was reviewing the groups.       </p><p>Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said he was looking into why the category wasn't previously removed:</p><p>More from industry:</p><p>Ericsson, Bank of America, and carmaker Daimler are just a few of the companies that have followed SpaceX in limiting or banning employee use of Zoom.       </p><p>          The company announced plans to fix           myriad security concerns, but the problems continue to plague Zoom's reputation for high-profile clients, Vlad Savov, Debby Wu, and Lananh Nguyen at Bloomberg News report.             \u00a0          </p><p>             But Zoom could have bigger problems, especially as it moves toward a fully encrypted platform.\u00a0          </p><p>          Zoom is just one of several communications and messaging companies struggling to keep up with a surge in explicit child imagery during the pandemic, Olivia Solon at NBC News reports.       </p><p>          Zoom users have reported having their meetings interrupted with child pornography from uninvited users. NBC News also found accounts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and in YouTube comments asking for child abuse images, sometimes called \"c.p.\" as a shorthand for children.\u00a0The posts linked to private messaging apps and file sites where the illegal content proliferates.       </p><p>          The issue is compounded by more users staying at home and a reduction in human moderation resources by tech companies. The struggle could embolden lawmakers who have centered child abuse content in their crusade against platforms increasing encryption, which makes that content harder to detect.       </p><p>Instagram said it has not reduced efforts to review child sexual exploitation material.       </p><p>             Correction: Bank of America and Ericsson have limited the use of Zoom, not banned it. SpaceX not Tesla banned Zoom.          </p><p>Instacart will hire 250,000 more shoppers, the company announced yesterday. \u00a0</p><p>The company will also extend covid-19 sick pay for shoppers and \"in-app check-ins for shoppers that need health and safety kits,\" Natasha Mascarenhas at TechCrunch reports.\u00a0</p><p>The company hired an additional 300,000 shoppers just last month and is working on more than doubling its customer support team. Instacart made some health and safety changes in response to worker protests, but workers say the company still hasn't done enough. For instance, workers are still requesting that the company raise the minimum tip for deliveries.\u00a0</p><p>             Shoppers also criticized the quality of the protective gear kits the company sent out. Here's one shopper unboxing her kit:          </p><p>Shoppers are planning a general strike for May 1 alongside Amazon and Target's Shipt workers.\u00a0</p><p>More workforce news:</p><p>             Have an event you want our readers to know about?

Sign up to get more news on tech politics and policy in your inbox.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Today is the last chance for the House Republican majority to publicly grill Google, one of their favorite targets in Big Tech.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers have made clear they're not going to let Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai off easy when he appears before the House Judiciary Committee this morning. Outgoing Committee Chair Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said topics will range from potential anti-conservative bias to the company's plans to push into China.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Google is a remarkable company that has accomplished a great deal,\" Goodlatte told my colleague Tony Romm, \"but given their size and their economic power, and some would argue political power based upon how search works and how YouTube\u00a0works, there are a lot of questions to address.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That makes today a major test for Pichai, as Tony\u00a0pointed out in an excellent preview of the hearing. The soft-spoken political neophyte acknowledged\u00a0during a White House visit last week that he had never stepped foot inside the Oval Office. But as he tries on the role of company spokesman, he's battling controversies on all sides - potentially setting himself up for a more combative hearing than interrogations of other tech executives this year.          </p><p>\"It's a challenging moment for our industry, but I'm privileged to be here today,\" Pichai says in the written testimony he submitted to the committee.</p><p>Here's your primer on the issues that have been worrying lawmakers and what Pichai will tell them:</p><p>             Bias against conservatives          </p><p>Republicans plan to interrogate the company on whether its algorithms are biased against conservative news sources, a charge the company has repeatedly vehemently denied. President Trump has also raised this issue, saying\u00a0that the company's search results for \"Trump News\" are \"rigged\" against him in a tweet this summer.</p><p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy teed it up\u00a0in a tweet on Monday:</p><p>It hasn't helped that Google is largely secretive about how its algorithms work. And at a time when conservatives were already wary about the prevalence of liberal political views at Silicon Valley companies,\u00a0a leaked video to Breitbart of a Google meeting after the 2016 election only amplified concerns that its employees had a left-leaning political bias that could influence their work.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, Google is under the same pressure as its social media peers to crack down on disinformation and hate speech on\u00a0its platform YouTube.\u00a0 Some of the decisions the company has made, such as restricting Internet conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on YouTube, have contributed to the perception of bias on the platform.\u00a0</p><p>Pichai will have to make the case that liberal employees at the Mountain View, Calif., company are not manipulating search results against any political group, despite their personal ideologies. He'll also have to find a way to speak in plain English about how his company's algorithms make decisions, even though the company says sharing too much detail would make it easier for people to manipulate where they stand in search results.</p><p>             Here's what Pichai says in his written testimony:             \"I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions - and we have no shortage of them among our own employees.\"          </p><p>             Data security          </p><p>Less than 24 hours before the hearing, Google revealed it had a new security bug affecting more than 52 million users, as\u00a0Tony and Craig Timberg reported.\u00a0Goodlatte confirmed to Tony that this latest security incident will be on the agenda today.\u00a0</p><p>This latest security bug was reported after we learned the company kept secret for months a vulnerability that put the data of hundreds of thousands of Google+ accounts at risk, as we reported in October. The incident ignited calls for national privacy legislation, as well as a Federal Trade Commission probe.\u00a0</p><p>Democrats have already promised to get tougher on privacy and data security issues in the next Congress, with some even\u00a0calling for data breach penalties similar to ones in the European Union 's General Data Protection Regulation. Their remarks could be a preview of what we can expect as they attempt to rein in Big Tech.</p><p>             From Pichai's testimony:             \"Protecting the privacy and security of our users has long been an essential part of our mission. We have invested an enormous amount of work over the years to bring choice, transparency, and control to our users. These values are built into every product we make.\"          </p><p>             China:          </p><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers have already pressed Google on its plans to push into China, due to the human rights implications of developing a censored version of a search engine. In another hearing this year focused on privacy, Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) slammed Google for building a version of its search engine for China while citing ethical concerns as the reason for pulling out of an artificial intelligence contract with the U.S. government. Goodlatte tells Tony\u00a0that China and the Pentagon contract, Project Maven, are both going to be raised in today's hearing.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>Goodlatte\u00a0told Tony\u00a0that there are \"lots of companies that do business in China and other places that have a totalitarian government.\" With Google, though, where the \"core is information sharing and searching for information and sharing ideas\" he said having a different set of standards in China is a very problematic thing.\"</p><p>Pichai did say recently\u00a0that Google's internal tests of a censored search engine have been very promising. Yet hundreds of employees signed a public letter demanding the company halt its work on the project. Even John Hennessy, the chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, has said he's conflicted on the strategy. Prepare for tense exchanges on this issue at a time when many in the U.S. government see themselves in a technology arms race against China.</p><p>             From Pichai's testimony:             Nothing. The written testimony does not mention China once, though Pichai will say, \"As an American company, we cherish the values and freedoms that have allowed us to grow and serve so many users. I am proud to say we do work, and we will continue to work, with the government to keep our country safe and secure.\"          </p><p>             Antitrust          </p><p>Trump said in a November interview that Google - as well as Amazon and Facebook - are being looked at for antitrust violations.</p><p>The FTC investigated Google during the Obama administration over how it displays search results - but it did not find an antitrust violation. Some U.S. lawmakers, such as\u00a0Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), want to see the United States reopen that probe. Europe has been far more active on antitrust, hitting Google with a $5 billion fine earlier this year.</p><p>Goodlatte\u00a0previously told my colleague Tony that when lawmakers met with Pichai in November, they \"served notice\" to him to expect questions on antitrust. Ahead of the hearing, several Republicans have noted that Google handles roughly 90 percent of world's searches online. Yesterday, Goodlatte wouldn't go so far as to say\u00a0 Google should face another investigation, but he said Congress should \"continue to do oversight\" on the company's footprint.\u00a0</p><p>Expect Pichai to make the case that consumers have alternatives. He could double down on the antitrust argument the company has previously made, which is\u00a0\"competition is just a click away.\"</p><p>             From Pichai's written testimony:             Pichai\u00a0makes no mention of antitrust or competition.          </p><p>             BITS: \u00a0Another issue Pichai may have to answer for today is the vast quantity of hateful, racist and conspiratorial videos that YouTube hosts. Critics in particular point to the fact that while Facebook and Twitter have been forced to publicly reckon with the use of their platforms to spread disinformation, hate and divisive content, YouTube and its parent company Google have escaped similar accountability, as The Washington Post's Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm and Andrew Ba Tran reported. Some say the company needs to step up its moderation efforts, because\u00a0 \"even though YouTube removes millions of videos on average each month, it is slow to identify troubling content and, when it does, is too permissive in what it allows to remain.\"</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said that \"whether it is deliberate or simply reckless, YouTube tends to tolerate messaging and narratives that seem to be at the very, very extreme end of the political spectrum, involving hatred, bias and bigotry.\"</p><p>             The sheer volume of content on the platform - 400 hours of video are uploaded every minute, according to the company - makes it hard for the company to root out hateful content. While the government maintains lists of terrorist groups to monitor them online, there's \"no equivalent list of hate groups or creators of hateful content,\" according to my colleagues.</p><p>             NIBBLES: A Chinese court ruled that Apple infringed on two Qualcomm patents and ordered Apple to stop selling older versions of its iPhones in China, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Tripp Mickle reported.\u00a0Qualcomm said in a news release that the patents relate to photo editing and managing applications via\u00a0touch screen. \"Apple continues to benefit from our intellectual property while refusing to compensate us,\"\u00a0Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement.\u00a0\"These Court orders are further confirmation of the strength of Qualcomm's vast patent portfolio.\"</p><p>The court ordered Apple to stop sales of the iPhone models\u00a06S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus and X, according to Qualcomm. \"The Nov. 30 decision by a Chinese court, which doesn't apply to new iPhone models launched this year, is the first in the world's largest smartphone market that seeks to curtail iPhone sales in the country,\" the Journal's\u00a0Mickle\u00a0wrote.\u00a0\"Apple said its full portfolio of iPhones in China remain on sale, and that it plans to appeal the court's decision.\"</p><p>             BYTES: GoPro plans to move most of its production of cameras destined for the U.S. market\u00a0out of China by summer 2019 as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing continues, the company announced in a news release. \"Today's geopolitical business environment requires agility, and we're proactively addressing tariff concerns by moving most of our US-bound camera production out of China,\" Brian McGee, executive vice president and chief financial officer of GoPro, said in a statement. \"We believe this diversified approach to production can benefit our business regardless of tariff implications.\"</p><p>The company's statement did not specify where GoPro intends to move the production of its U.S.-bound cameras. However, production of cameras for other countries will remain in China, GoPro said.\u00a0\"GoPro could provide an early look of the post-'Make America Great' tech supply chain, where your gadget is made in Vietnam or Indonesia, instead of China,\"\u00a0Joe Wittine, an analyst at Longbow Research, told Bloomberg News's\u00a0Krista Gmelich\u00a0and Selina Wang.</p><p>             -- Amazon.com's move to build its own computer chips could help the company save money - and it may also spell trouble for Intel. Amazon's goal isn't to sell the chip to customers but instead to use it in its data centers' servers, according to the New York Times's\u00a0Cade Metz.\u00a0\"The homegrown chip also gives Amazon bargaining power with Intel, which hasn't had much competition in the server market in recent years,\" Metz wrote. \"The internet company will still buy from Intel because it would be difficult to build all the chips it needed on its own. But now it will have options.\" (Amazon\u00a0founder and chief executive Jeffrey P.

In the wake of walkouts\u00a0at Google offices around\u00a0the world last month to protest claims of sexual harassment and inequality, a\u00a0group of Google employees now seeks to eradicate forced arbitration within the tech industry as a whole, according to TechCrunch's Megan Rose Dickey.</p><p>The employees are\u00a0\"demanding an end to forced arbitration, as it relates to any case of discrimination, across the entire industry,\" TechCrunch reported. Recode's\u00a0Shirin Ghaffary reported\u00a0that organizers at Google said that \"they've heard from tech workers at over 15 other major tech companies about their experiences with forced arbitration\"\u00a0since the Google walkout took place.</p><p>             - More news about tech workforce issues:          </p><p>             - A New York Times investigation exposed\u00a0how some businesses receive and sell detailed user location data, prompting several Democratic lawmakers to call for Congress to pass privacy legislation.

Compared to other big events when lawmakers hauled in executives from other industries under scrutiny - such as tobacco or banking - the tech companies appearing today \"all have different problems, though some of them overlap,\" Sohn said.</p><p>Not to mention the executives are appearing over video conference - a format that's not exactly conducive to made-for-TV moments despite it being a pivotal moment in lawmakers' year-long investigation into Big Tech.</p><p>             Here's what you need to know:          </p><p>             Why lawmakers are worried: The Amazon chief executive's e-commerce empire is massive. Lawmakers are sure to grill Bezos about whether the company has abused its position as a key sales platform to harness data from third-party sellers and give its own products a leg up. Amazon has denied engaging in such a practice, but Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) has questioned this in light of news reports that appear to contradict previous assurances the company made to the panel.          </p><p>Amazon's argument: Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, will tell a deeply personal yarn about his rise from being the son of a teen mom to building one of the largest companies in the world. He'll argue that the company's size has allowed it to create many jobs during a global pandemic, and support important social causes such as addressing climate change. His opening remarks, however, didn't indicate how he plans to respond to the accusations that the company siphons data from rivals for its own gain. He plans to note that most Americans have a favorable impression of Amazon, citing \"leading independent polls\" that he didn't identify, as my colleague Jay Greene reported.\u00a0          </p><p>             \"At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,\" Bezos wrote. (Read Amazon's testimony here.)          </p><p>Why lawmakers are worried: Companies ranging from Tinder to Microsoft have raised concerns that Apple's App Store is too powerful. They've complained about Apple policies that force companies to hand over a portion of the subscriptions and other purchases made through iPhone apps. Companies argue these policies have hurt them financially and left iPhone owners with higher bills. It has only intensified during the pandemic as more companies make their services virtual. Developers have also accused Apple of using its position to copy the best ideas, causing companies to buckle under pressure, Reed Albergotti reported.\u00a0</p><p>Apple's defense: Cook will say the App Store is a \"revolutionary alternative\" to the options software developers had before it launched in 2008, compared to pushing physical products or scoring shelf space in a brick-and-mortar store with limited reach. He'll emphasize that Apple has never raised commissions or added fees since introducing the App Store. He'll also highlight the company's focus on privacy and security.</p><p>\"I share the subcommittee's belief that competition is a great virtue, that it promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea and that it gives consumers more choices,\" Cook is expected to say. (Read Apple's testimony here.)</p><p>             Why lawmakers are worried: Facebook is staring down a host of political controversies in Washington, but the crux of the competition concerns revolve around how it reportedly siphons data about competing social media start-ups to imitate or snap up their services. My colleague Elizabeth Dwoskin previously outlined that strategy, which hinged on an app called Onavo. The company used it to glean insights about what customers were doing when they weren't on Facebook or other services the company owns, such as Instagram. That allowed Facebook to spot other competitors on the rise. However, the app created major data privacy concerns, and Facebook ultimately shut down the service last year.          </p><p>Facebook's argument: Zuckerberg will try to emphasize the fleeting nature of success in Silicon Valley, noting that when he moved the company to the former campus of Sun Microsystems, he left the old company's sign up as a reminder to employees to stay hungry. \"Facebook is a successful company now, but we got there the American way: we started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable,\" Zuckerberg will say. \"As I understand our laws, companies aren't bad just because they are big.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg will also stress how his business is even more critical during stay-at-home orders: He'll note that people use his services to stay in touch with family and friends and get the latest information from public officials about the pandemic. He'll tout new products the company has built in response to the coronavirus crisis. (Read Facebook's testimony here.)</p><p>Why lawmakers are worried: Critics say Google is dominant in search and advertising, and that can harm a range of competitors, from news outlets to travel companies. Google could imminently face antitrust scrutiny in the United States, as Tony Romm reported that the Justice Department and state attorneys general could file charges against the company as soon as this summer. European regulators have fined the search giant billions over concerns that its advertising practices break antitrust laws, and they've signaled more action is coming.</p><p>Google's take: Pichai, who is chief executive of Google and its parent company, will argue that the company plays an essential role in expanding access to greater economic opportunity through technology. Pichai will speak about his own experience having regular Internet access for the first time as a graduate student in the United States, and he'll particularly highlight how the company's products are being used by educators during the pandemic. He'll also speak about the major investments the company makes in research and development in the United States.</p><p>\"To this day, I haven't forgotten how access to innovation and technology altered the course of my life,\" Pichai plans to say. \"Google aims to build products that increase access to opportunity for everyone - no matter where you live, what you believe, or how much money you earn.\" (Read Google's testimony here.)</p><p>One of the revolutionary aspects of the congressional investigation has been other competitors' willingness to speak out about the giants, a sea change in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Today, TikTok jumped on the bandwagon: As Zuckerberg is expected to warn that lawmakers need to be wary of the threat of competition from Chinese tech companies as they weigh tech regulation, TikTok's chief executive Kevin Mayer called out Facebook for launching a \"copycat product\" which lets people create short videos similar to those on TikTok.</p><p>Mayer said the company welcomes competition: \"Facebook is even launching another copycat product, Reels (tied to Instagram), after their other copycat Lasso failed quickly,\" he said. \"But let's focus our energies on fair and open competition in service of our consumers, rather than maligning attacks by our competitor - namely Facebook - disguised as patriotism and designed to put an end to our very presence in the U.S.\" Beijing-based ByteDance owns TikTok.</p><p>             Correction:                              TikTok's chief executive is Kevin Mayer. A previous version incorrectly listed his last name.                       </p><p>Programming note: The Washington Post's Libby Casey will anchor a special report around the judiciary committee hearing on Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. Casey will be joined by reporters Elizabeth Dwoskin, Tony Romm and me for analysis on how this event may affect consumers, the economy and legislation. Tune in here.\u00a0</p><p>Hulu and Verizon also rejected the campaign, which was sponsored by the liberal groups Priorities USA and Color of Change PAC, Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. The 30-second ad shows clips of police officers beating protesters set against a recent Trump speech where he calls himself a \"president of law and order.\"</p><p>Google maintained it blocked the graphic ad to prevent harm to users.</p><p>\"We don't allow advertisers to run ads that contain graphic violence, including depictions of blood, baton beatings, and other instances of physical trauma,\" said Charlotte Smith, a spokeswoman for the company. \"These policies apply to all advertisers, regardless of political affiliation.\" Hulu and Verizon expressed similar reasons for rejecting the ad to Priorities USA. Facebook ran the ad.</p><p>The groups say the content moderation decision highlights an ongoing double standard for the Trump campaign.</p><p>             \"The decision by Google and other online platforms to censor our ads while allowing Trump to use violence in his own ads only exacerbates the problem and prevents our elected officials from being held accountable for their dangerous actions,\" Priorities USA Deputy Executive Director Jenn Stowe said.</p><p>The suspension underlines the tough stance the platform has taken against medical misinformation during the pandemic, Rachel Lerman, Katie Shepherd and Taylor Telford report. But it also renewed accusations of bias against conservatives at a time when the Trump administration is pushing regulators to reevaluate legal protections for social media companies.</p><p>The restriction was \"further proof that Big Tech is intent on killing free expression online and is another instance of them committing election interference to stifle Republican voices,\" Donald Trump Jr.'s spokesman Andy Surabian said. Tech companies have repeatedly denied that they're biased against conservatives.</p><p>The video shared by Trump shows a news conference of a group of doctors claiming without evidence that hydroxychloroquine could cure and treat the virus. Twitter removed videos of the news conference, deleting several of the tweets that President Trump shared in the process. Medical experts say there is not enough evidence to prove that hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria, helps covid-19 patients recover, and it carries deadly side effects, particularly taken without a doctor's order.</p><p>The president also praised the viral social media video in a news conference with reporters yesterday.</p><p>The ruling gives legal weight to drivers in an ongoing battle with ride-hailing companies over their worker classification, Noam Scheiber at the New York Times reports.</p><p>The New York Taxi Workers Alliance brought the lawsuit in May, alleging that the state was taking weeks and even months longer to pay unemployed ride-hailing drivers than other unemployed employees. The lawsuit alleged the delay was due at least in part to the state's failure to require Uber and Lyft to submit lost earnings data. </p><p>The ruling noted that in 294 cases where the state found Uber to be an employer, Uber appealed 227. Uber abandoned 200 of the appeals, but the state accused both Uber and Lyft of intentionally trying to evade sharing earnings data. ber and Lyft denied the allegations.</p><p>Both Uber and Lyft are facing lawsuits in Massachusetts and California claiming the companies are misclassifying workers as independent contractors.</p><p>CES, the world's largest tech trade show, is officially going virtual next year. While it's a blow for the Vegas economy, it might just be a relief for many tech journalists.</p><p>Some attendees raised concerns about how effective a virtual trade show can be:</p><p>But others, including my colleague Tony Romm, have brainstormed fun ways to recreate the experience at home!</p><p>Another great idea!</p><p>A group that included Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI to assess the threat posed by the video app, Alexandra Alper at Reuters reports.</p><p>\"We are greatly concerned that the (Chinese Communist Party) could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate (political) conversations to sow discord among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes,\" the lawmakers wrote.</p><p>TikTok has come under fierce criticism in D.C. over its ownership by Chinese parent company ByteDance. Trump has threatened to ban the app over concerns that it could be used by China for spying.</p><p>TikTok has repeatedly denied imposing Chinese censorship laws in the United States. The company also says it has not and would not share any U.S. user data with Beijing.</p><p>\"TikTok isn't the go-to app to follow political news or candidates, but we're taking cues from the experience of our peers during the last US presidential election and proactively investing to safeguard our app,\" TikTok spokeswoman Jamie Favazza said. TikTok already has a strict policy against disinformation, and we don't accept political ads. Our content and moderation policies are led by our US-based team in California and aren't influenced by any foreign government.\"</p><p>             A group of a dozen Democratic senators and one independent              wrote to Senate leadership              yesterday urging them to              include legislation              that would put guardrails protecting data collected for covid-19 from being used for non-public health reasons. They argue that a failure to build public trust in data collection efforts will undermine the government's coronavirus response.          </p><p>             The next relief bill could pass as early as this week.          </p><p>The technology was deployed in largely lower-income and nonwhite neighborhoods, Jeffrey Dastin at Reuters found. The retailer's expansive program, which it has since discontinued, highlights the dangers of the largely unregulated use of facial recognition technology in the United States.</p><p>Government studies have shown that facial recognition software is less effective on darker skin tones. Ten current and former Rite Aid employees who worked on the loss-prevention program said that one of the systems it used from company FaceFirst routinely misidentified people, especially shoppers of color. FaceFirst denied Reuters's findings. </p><p>Rite Aid told Reuters earlier this year that signs warned customers of the technology, but reporters found no such notice in more than a third of the 75 stores they visited.</p><p>MacKenzie Scott, formerly Bezos, says she has given away $1.7 billion of her wealth so far (CNN)</p><p>AMC, Universal Agree to Trim Theatrical Window Before Movies Go Online (The Wall Street Journal)</p><p>Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook will all release their quarterly earnings tomorrow.</p><p>             RightsCon will take place online on July 27-31.          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-6ae16c66e65f4fb2934f27dfe00d5f3d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-71H1-JB4M-V373-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2587\"/><timeReceived>1:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

We'll be back in your inbox on Tuesday.\u00a0</p><p>Photo Credit: Simon and Schuster</p><p>             \"The Library\u00a0Book\" by Susan Orlean          </p><p>Recommended by Laura Stevens, deputy technology editor:\u00a0\"While the book's title is accurately rather low-tech in nature, Orlean takes readers on a fascinating nonfiction journey centered around the mysterious fire that burned down the Los Angeles Public Library in 1986. She pulls in threads regarding the history of that library, its collection and its building, along with fascinating tales of the first female librarian and other characters who ended up in charge there. It's a must read for anyone who grew up loving sifting through books at their local library - even if you read this one as an e-book (I am).\u00a0It also wraps in how the current-day library has become something of a tech mecca for the homeless and other citizens without access to the Internet or computers.\"</p><p>             \"The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming\"\u00a0by David Wallace Wells          </p><p>From Geoffrey A. Fowler, technology columnist:\u00a0\"[This book] does a remarkable job at humanizing the climate crisis that few of us can really wrap our heads around. The book's main technique is scaring the pants off you - describing a planet you don't recognize that's coming in your lifetime. The first line gives you the gist: 'It is worse, much worse, than you think.'\u00a0The book has potential to be this generation's 'Silent Spring.'\"\u00a0</p><p>             \"Small Fry\" by Lisa Brennan-Jobs          </p><p>From Christina Passariello, technology editor: \"It's partly an exploration of a very unusual father-daughter relationship, and shows us the private and flawed side of tech's demigod. It's also a great window into what Silicon Valley was like 30 years ago, at a time when it wasn't so overrun with wealth like it is now. It's hard to imagine a single mother artist being able to afford living in Palo Alto these days.\"\u00a0</p><p>             \"Circe\"\u00a0by Madeline Miller          </p><p>From Drew Harwell, national technology reporter covering artificial intelligence: \"My favorite recent read is definitely 'Circe,'\u00a0which pulls the island witch goddess from the mythical fringes\u00a0and recasts her into this fascinating, feminist heroine's tale.\u00a0It's Greek fantasy, so something crazy happens every page, but it's the quieter parts about love and loss that end up being the most memorable.\"\u00a0</p><p>             \"Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Nuclear Disaster\" by Adam Higginbotham is another one of Drew's recommendations: \"Right now, thanks to HBO, I'm totally gripped by 'Midnight in Chernobyl,'\u00a0which gives this colorful and haunting human dimension to the infamous nuclear disaster, and explores all the paranoia, secrecy and insanity of the Cold War. It's scarily good.\"\u00a0</p><p>             \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power\" by Shoshana Zuboff          </p><p>From Jonathan Baran, video reporter: \"I am a few chapters into Shoshana Zuboff's The Age of Surveillance Capitalism. It's a pretty thorough and scholarly evisceration of technology companies' data-gathering efforts. She's obviously picking a bone but it's a sharp pointy one that's all too relevant these days.\"</p><p>Jonathan also says he's diving into Chinese science fiction and recently picked up \"The Three Body Problem\" by Liu Cixin and \"The Waste Tide\" by Chen Qifan. He says: \"Waste Tide is more topical of the two: It's a dystopian future set on an island of electronic waste off the coast of China.\"</p><p>             \"Season of the Witch: Enchantment, Terror and Deliverance in the City of Love\" by David Talbot          </p><p>This one is on my own reading list. This book tells\u00a0the gripping tale of a San Francisco I've never known - one that had not yet been transformed by technology companies. The book focuses on the turbulent years between 1967 and 1982, as the city was revolutionized by the Summer of Love and then grappled with the fallout. Whether you live in San Francisco or just visit for work, this book will help you delve into the city's wild history and understand its resilience. And as a bonus, you can check out the playlist that accompanies the book of the best songs recorded by San Francisco bands between 1965 and 1985.</p><p>For more non-fiction, I would also recommend \"Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI. \" As we think about how law enforcement is grappling with new technologies like facial recognition, it was instructive to look back at how the FBI dealt with the rise of early sleuthing techniques like fingerprints. If you're looking for lighter fiction, I'd also suggest \"Family Trust, \" which is set in the Bay Area and includes\u00a0biting satire of the venture capital industry.\u00a0</p><p>             \"Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\" by John Carreyrou          </p><p>From Jay Greene, Seattle technology reporter: \"One of the best business books in a long time, written by Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou on the downfall of Theranos, something that Carreyrou's reporting hastened. The rapid rise and even faster fall of the blood-testing company makes for a great tale, and includes a raft of fascinating and famous characters including former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and, most interesting of all, Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. It's such a riveting read that a Hollywood studio is working on a screenplay that would star Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes.\"</p><p>Jay also recommends \"Calypso\" by David\u00a0Sedaris:\u00a0\"I picked up Sedaris's most recent book to read on a recent flight and promptly embarrassed myself by trying to muffle snorts of laughter so as not to disturb fellow passengers. Sedaris always writes about his family. But in Calypso, his return to the topic is a bit more touching, if not dark, than in previous works. And yet, it's still laugh-out-loud funny.\"</p><p>             \"The Reckoning\" by David Halberstam          </p><p>From Faiz Siddiqui, technology reporter covering automation and the future of transportation: \"Halberstam's book contrasts two great auto industry giants - Ford and Nissan - and the differing approaches they took to car manufacturing as the 70s oil crisis bore down on the global economy. Innovation-starved Ford was caught flat-footed with a fleet of big, gas guzzling heaps of sheet metal just as Americans were turning toward fuel-efficient compact cars. And Nissan, then known as Datsun, capitalized on that desire with smaller, gas-saving front-wheel-drive cars that were lighter and fun to drive, eliminating the hefty drive shaft that traditionally sent power to the back wheels. The finance gurus at Ford - cost-cutting experts who deliberately shortened the life spans of their products - were blindsided by their falling profits, having arrogantly dismissing the Japanese automakers in the decades before. The book concludes with the rise of South Korea's auto industry. Today, you'll recognize, Ford is eliminating sedans, preferring to focus on bigger SUVs that Americans have shown a preference for. The Big Three automakers are focused on their profits but innovation is coming out of unexpected places: South Korea, the Silicon Valley, China. Is history doomed to repeat itself?\"</p><p>Photo Credit: Simon and Schuster</p><p>             \"Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom\" by David W. Blight          </p><p>From Craig Timberg, national reporter covering technology:\u00a0\"It won the Pulitzer Prize, but more importantly it captured how a single man, imperfect but fueled by a passionate quest for justice for African Americans, changed the way 19th Century Americans thought about race and power. Douglass's life was sweeping and astonishing - starting on a Maryland plantation and bringing him to the White House and beyond - and so is this book.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Videos that have been manipulated to make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appear drunk were ricocheting across social media - highlighting the rampant proliferation of political disinformation,\u00a0my colleague Drew Harwell writes.\u00a0</p><p>Pelosi's onstage speech this week at a Center for American Progress event was subtly edited to make her voice sound garbled and warped, as if she were drunkenly slurring her words. The video then spread quickly across Twitter, YouTube and Facebook.\u00a0</p><p>One version - posted by the conservative Facebook page Politics WatchDog - garnered more than 1.4 million views, was shared more than 32,000 times and attracted 16,000 comments, where people called her \"drunk\" and \"a babbling mess.\"\u00a0</p><p>According to analyses of the video by Washington Post journalists and outside researchers, the video editors slowed it to about 75 percent of its initial speed. It also appears to have been altered to change her pitch, possibly to correct for how that slowdown would have deepened her tone.\u00a0</p><p>\"The altered video's spread highlights the subtle way that viral misinformation could shape public understanding in the run-up to the 2020 election,\" Drew writes. \"Spreaders of misinformation don't need sophisticated technology to go viral: Even simple, crude manipulations can be used to undermine an opponent or score political points.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook removed more than 3 billion accounts during a six-month period between October and March - highlighting the social network's ongoing challenge to clean up its platform,\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm writes.\u00a0</p><p>The new figure came yesterday as the company unveiled its latest transparency report, which also described the prevalence of hate speech, graphic photos and other abusive content on the network. The company said the billions of accounts it removed were \"never considered active\" so they didn't count toward the company's tally of monthly active users. The company reported it had 2.3 billion monthly active users in the first quarter of this year and estimated about 5 percent of those are fake accounts.\u00a0</p><p>As the company announced the takedowns, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg doubled down on his defense of the company at a time when people are calling for it to be broken up. In a widely circulated op-ed this month, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes cited the company's failures in dealing with viral disinformation and other ills as he called on regulators to take antitrust action against the company.\u00a0</p><p>Zuckerberg pointed to Facebook's increased investments in safety and security. \"We're able to do things that are not possible for other companies to do,\" he said during a call with reporters to discuss the transparency report. \"When you look at it, we really need to decide what issues we think are the most important to address. In some ways, some of the remedies cut against each other.\"</p><p>But some critics don't buy that line of defense, as I've previously written in The Technology 202.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a Democratic presidential candidate, said the policy world has failed when it comes to regulating Facebook.          </p><p> \"Facebook and other companies are having to make--I mean, they are making decisions as a company that amount to public policy decisions, and the reason they are is that the policy world has failed,\" he said. \"We've had the spectacle of legislators making it abundantly clear that they don't even understand what they're regulating. And we can't expect anything different as long as we don't create the boundaries in the policy space for how these tech companies are supposed to behave.\"</p><p>He pushed back on the suggestion that the company should be regulated as a utility, as Sen. Kamala Harris, one of his rivals, has proposed.\u00a0</p><p>\"Well, the main thing you do with a regulated utility is control the prices. And you definitely pay a price\u00a0for using Facebook, but the price is in terms of your attention, your data, and your privacy, not in terms of paying to use the service. And so we do have to regulate it, but in a smart way. Like what does it mean to regulate how much of your attention or how much of your data? A company - I like the metaphor of a utility, but I think the question is a lot deeper than just do we slap the same kinds of controls that we would for - and I run a regulated utility, because we do wastewater and water.\u00a0I think it's similar in some ways, but it's different in some ways.\"</p><p>He called for the Federal Trade Commission to be empowered, suggesting that it then could reverse consolidation - stopping short of calling, as Elizabeth Warren has, for the agency to reverse Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>\"The fundamental issue is, first of all, monopolistic behavior, which means the FTC needs to be empowered to block or even perhaps reverse consolidation; and separate but related, what we do with data security and privacy, whether you're a giant company like Facebook or a small one, I still want you to be protecting my data,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>             -- President Trump once again took a jab at Twitter last night, criticizing the company for shutting down conservative voices. The company has repeatedly denied that it is biased against conservatives.\u00a0          </p><p>News from the private sector:\u00a0</p><p>Government tech news:\u00a0</p><p>Tech news generating buzz on the Web:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-42002ab2a7f24fe4babe14178297c537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W60-TPB1-JB4M-V4GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2336\"/><timeReceived>1:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 24, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0005VQA</classCode><className>SIMON &amp;

But in the last two years, he's transformed into a champion for the Washington lawmakers and regulators trying to rein in Big Tech.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The author of \"Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe\" spent decades in tech investing, with a front-row seat to the rise of top companies. But in 2016, he also had a close-up view of how the social network\u00a0giant failed to swiftly respond to concerns it was being manipulated by Russia during the presidential election.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, McNamee has emerged as an unlikely activist - regularly advising Washington policymakers on the inner workings of Silicon Valley.\u00a0</p><p>             \"When I first began talking to people at the [Federal Trade Commission] and members of Congress about these issues in the summer of 2017, we were still in the last days of a 50-year period where there was no reason to regulate tech,\" McNamee told me. \"What we have now is a dark side has emerged, essentially full-grown out of nowhere, and Washington has to get up to speed.\"          </p><p>McNamee and I spoke yesterday about his book and the action he wants to see from policymakers. Here's our conversation, edited for length and clarity.</p><p>             Technology 202: What misconceptions did you previously have about how Washington works and approaches regulating business?McNamee: There is a misperception in Silicon Valley that government can only harm the economy, it can't help. That is a ridiculous belief. In a capitalist system, the government plays an essential role as the setter and enforcer role. We have forgotten that.</p><p>If we look at the way we live today, government doesn't set the rules and doesn't enforce them. The tech industry sets the rules and enforces them. Our lives are more governed by the algorithms and the code of companies like Google and Facebook than they are by the law. And yet tech platforms like Google and Facebook were never elected, they are not accountable to anyone, and they show no understanding of the responsibilities that come with the power they have. If they were benevolent dictators, they would be more sympathetic. But as dictators who seem to prioritize only their own short-term best interests, they represent a threat to a lot of the values that are most basic to Americans.</p><p>             Tech 202: Is Washington equipped to take on Silicon Valley and rein in these tech companies?          </p><p>             McNamee: It is not only capable of it, but it will do a great job. There are two reasons I think that's true. The first is that Washington regulates industries far more complex than technology very effectively. I always point to banking, health care and defense.</p><p>When you look at tech, we didn't even know there was something to regulate until the fall of 2017. The products that we're talking about are products that every member of Congress - with only a handful exceptions - use to some degree or another. All their constituents use them.</p><p>Time favors this really strongly. Congress will get younger and more tech literate, and it's just not that complicated.</p><p>             Tech 202: What do you think of the recent report that Facebook and the FTC are negotiating over a multibillion fine in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal?          </p><p>             McNamee: If the only thing that happens is a fine, then Facebook will dismiss it as a cost of business. There has to be a second part of any solution, which is we have to change the incentives.</p><p>             Tech 202: These companies are global, and we're seeing regulators in Europe scrutinizing the tech giants more and more. Are you also communicating with European regulators and policymakers as they're looking into Facebook?          </p><p>             McNamee: I have communicated with people in Europe and would be available to help them in any way possible. They seem to have it under control. I look at whether it's the Global Data Protection Regulation, whether it is the German law that would radically alter the profiling done by Facebook and by others who have similar techniques, whether it is the United Kingdom's parliamentary report that branded Facebook and its executives as \"digital gangsters,\" those are all very positive steps.</p><p>I don't think any of these things is the perfect answer. I would prefer to move away from the GDPR or California model of penalties after the fact and go to preventing the kinds of behaviors that cause the problems in the first place, and that would be data related to people's most private activities, like financial transactions and location. But every one of those laws increases the pressure on the technology platforms and data economy participants to reform their behavior and accept they owe a responsibility to society to do no harm.</p><p>             Tech 202: What do you think needs to be included in a national privacy law as Congress considers legislation?          </p><p>             McNamee: If you want to protect people's privacy, the most important thing is to eliminate the exploitation of their most private data. It's hard to get the genie back in the bottle on the data itself. It's very straightforward to eliminate use cases. Eliminating the use of personal financial data without explicit permission on a per transaction basis is the most obvious place to start.</p><p>             BITS: Lawmakers on Capitol Hill and privacy advocates say\u00a0the Federal Trade Commission's\u00a0investigation into Facebook is a test of the agency's ability to rein in Silicon Valley giants, The Washington Post's Tony Romm reported. \"The FTC is speaking to the whole industry in what it does here. Its audience is well beyond Facebook and that company's customers. It's to the whole world and the entire tech industry, that finally it means business in protecting privacy,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said.\u00a0The FTC is negotiating\u00a0with the social network on a fine that could reach billions of dollars and would settle a probe by the agency into Facebook's privacy practices.</p><p>             Some critics have claimed that the agency has not been tough enough with tech firms that don't abide by their legal agreements about\u00a0privacy issues with the FTC. \"The Facebook inquiry is a basic test of the credibility of the FTC to be an effective privacy enforcement agency,\" William Kovacic, a former Republican FTC commissioner who now teaches at George Washington University, told Tony. \"Anything other than a significant penalty will be seen as a form of policy failure and will really impede the agency's ability to function in the future.\"          </p><p>             NIBBLES: Disinformation efforts are targeting several candidates or potential contenders for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, Politico's Natasha Korecki reported. The disinformation campaign, which\u00a0uses memes and hashtags and misrepresents the candidates'\u00a0positions, appears aimed at undercutting the contenders\u00a0as they are still in the early days of their presidential bids. Those efforts have mainly targeted Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who have officially announced their candidacies, as well as former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who is weighing a presidential run.</p><p>             Some signs suggest that part of the disinformation efforts\u00a0are coordinated and bear\u00a0similarities with the Russian troll farm Internet Research Agency's tactics, but this activity has not been definitely attributed to\u00a0specific actors. Moreover, not all of those disinformation efforts are the result of a coordinated effort. \"Recent posts that have received widespread dissemination include racially inflammatory memes and messaging involving Harris, O'Rourke and Warren,\" Politico reported.\u00a0\"In Warren's case, a false narrative surfaced alleging that a blackface doll appeared on a kitchen cabinet in the background of the senator's New Year's Eve Instagram livestream.\"</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0Several companies have paused advertising on YouTube after a video blogger reported material sexually\u00a0exploiting children on the site, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Patience Haggin and Suzanne Vranica reported. Companies that have removed ads from the video platform include Nestl\u00e9, McDonald's, Epic Games,\u00a0which makes the video game Fortnite, Canada Goose and other firms. For a brand to\u00a0be associated with that kind of content can damage their reputation, according to ad buyers, the Journal noted. A spokeswoman for YouTube said the company took quick action against the material after it found out about the issue.</p><p>             \"The advertisers' withdrawals come after video blogger Matt Watson posted a video on YouTube on Sunday that showed inappropriate user comments about videos featuring underage girls, including some that identified precise segments where children appear in compromising positions,\" according to the Journal. \"The video, which had received over 1.7 million views as of Wednesday afternoon, said YouTube's recommendation algorithm leads users to similar content.\"</p><p>             - Pinterest stopped showing results for searches\u00a0on terms related to vaccination in an effort to\u00a0crack\u00a0down on unsubstantiated anti-vaccination content on its platform,\u00a0the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Robert McMillan and Daniela Hernandez reported. The company made the change late last year and has also started to police content about unreliable cancer therapies.\u00a0Pinterest has said its decision to block searches on vaccination is temporary.\u00a0\"Most shared images on Pinterest relating to vaccination cautioned against it, contradicting established medical guidelines and research showing that vaccines are safe, Pinterest said,\"\u00a0according to the Journal.\u00a0\"The image-searching platform tried to remove the antivaccination content, a Pinterest spokeswoman said, but has been unable to remove it completely.\"</p><p>             - Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will meet today with Jeremy Wright, the United Kingdom's digital chief who wants to regulate Silicon Valley technology companies,\u00a0according to a report this morning from CNN's Hadas Gold.\u00a0Zuckerberg is meeting with Wright after declining to appear in front of Parliament after several requests. Wright is on a tour of Silicon Valley this week, as the Tech 202 previously reported. \"For Wright, the visit to California with UK Digital Minister Margot James is a way to get input from the companies that will be directly impacted by any future UK regulation - something that is no longer a question of if it happens, but when and how,\" Wright reported.\u00a0</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) wants Amazon to open headquarters in Newark after the tech company abandoned plans to do so in New York amid local opposition, Cheddar's\u00a0Jim Roberts reported. \"We want HQ2,\" Booker told Cheddar in an interview. \"We've sent that message out already. And everybody from the Governor to the Mayor to local leaders have been reaching out to Amazon.\" Booker, a former mayor of Newark, also suggested that the city could be able to address concerns about gentrification. \"We are growing and booming as a city,\" he said. \"But we are making sure that we have a pathway for all of Newarkers to prevent the ills that are often evident in gentrification and make sure that things work on our terms.\" (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             - A conservative\u00a0group called Job Creators Network placed a billboard in Times Square\u00a0scolding Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) for her opposition to Amazon's now-scrapped\u00a0plan to open headquarters in New York, the Hill's Tal Axelrod reported. \"The pullout of Amazon-because of anti-business politicians, notably Ocasio-Cortez-is a major blow to the New York economy,\" the group said in a statement, according to the Hill.\u00a0\"The retreat will not only cost the area $12 billion in economic activity, but 25,000 new jobs that would have paid an average salary of $150,000.\"</p><p>             - European Union countries approved a revamp of copyright\u00a0rules that would affect Facebook and Google, Reuters's\u00a0Foo Yun Chee reported. \"The revamp would require Google and other online platforms to sign licensing agreements with rights holders such as musicians, performers, authors, news publishers and journalists to use their work online,\" according to Reuters. \"Google's YouTube and Facebook's Instagram and other sharing platforms will have to install upload filters to prevent users from uploading copyrighted materials.\" The changes still have\u00a0to go through a number of votes before becoming law.</p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0Dane Butswinkas, Tesla's general counsel, is leaving the company\u00a0two months after he was hired and is returning to the Williams &amp; Connolly law firm where he previously worked, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Tim Higgins and Rebecca Ballhaus reported.\u00a0\"Mr. Butswinkas's exit marks another high-profile executive departure for the company during the past two years, as Tesla has labored to turn the Model 3 into its first mass-market electric car,\" the Journal reported.</p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - News about tech incidents and blunders:          </p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Coming soon:          </p><p>Samsung's new Galaxy S10 has twists in the screen to make other smartphones seem dated:</p><p>\"We're the cool kids\": Here's people enjoying the snowstorm around D.C.</p><p>3 lawmakers leave Britain's Conservative Party:</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-7ddbb577e12341dc9173dd431d080440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VGC-N7B1-JB4M-V34N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2295\"/><timeReceived>1:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 21, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Three members of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee in recent weeks have sent emails to potential donors touting their efforts to pressure the executives of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All of the emails cited highlights from a high-profile July antitrust hearing with the chief executives of all four companies, when lawmakers delivered a bruising indictment of the industry\u2019s power.   It signals that lawmakers see tech regulation as an issue that could curry political support in a heated election year.   Much of the chatter about breaking up Big Tech has died down on the campaign trail in the months since Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) dropped out of the race. And tech policy issues have largely been absent from high-profile political events in recent weeks, including at this week\u2019s Democratic convention. But the fundraising blitz is a sign it could bubble up again \u2014 even in down-ballot races.   Democrats' emails focused on their commitment to follow through on the antitrust investigation into big companies.    \u201cI won\u2019t back down from this fight,\u201d wrote Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.), the Democrat leading the House investigation into major tech companies. \u201cWill you make a contribution today to support our work to hold Big Tech accountable?\u201d   AD   AD   Cicilline\u2019s email highlighted an exchange in the July hearing with Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos about feedback the committee collected from third-party sellers using the e-commerce platform. One seller, Cicilline said in the clip, compared Amazon to heroin, because they felt like they had to keep returning to the platform even though they knew it would be their downfall. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42874344780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MJ-WB11-F07F-839M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"348\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 19, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.) said during an interview with me on C-SPAN's \"The Communicators\" that aired this weekend. \"But at the same time, I think we ought to have a freedom of responsibility.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Johnson says it's time for Congress to \"get more aggressive\" in making sure companies such as Facebook and Twitter don't incite partisanship on social media.\u00a0\"We've got to be a little bit more aggressive and making sure there's responsibility there.\"\u00a0</p><p>             This sentiment from leading Democrats signals that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg might face a frosty or even hostile reception when he testifies on Capitol Hill this week. He will almost certainly be on the defensive about\u00a0Facebook's recent announcement it will\u00a0not\u00a0fact-check or moderate\u00a0politicians posts or ads, which is fueling concerns the company is allowing the spread of misinformation ahead of the elections.\u00a0          </p><p>The issue has become a flashpoint among Democratic White House hopefuls. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Joe Biden have criticized Facebook's recent decision to run a Trump campaign ad that made false claims about the former vice president's dealings with Ukraine. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), has called on Twitter to suspend the president's account.\u00a0</p><p>Johnson's comments came during a wide-ranging interview with me and C-SPAN's Peter Slen, where we discussed the state of tech regulation in Washington and her committee's efforts to ensure the United States is investing in technology. Here are some excerpts from that conversation, which have been edited for clarity:</p><p>             On disinformation ahead of the 2020 election:          </p><p>             Zakrzewski: [Your committee recently held] a hearing on deepfakes, videos that are edited with artificial intelligence to make it look like people are doing or saying things that never happened. As we get closer and closer to the 2020 election, do you think that the tech companies are doing enough to address disinformation?\u00a0</p><p>             Johnson: That is difficult to tell. I think that we need to be more knowledgeable so that we also can be involved and know what we need to look for so that we will know ourselves when it's off course. That is a challenge. It's a challenge because we've not been down this road before, but there are many other roads that are going to be coming along that we have not been before, and we've got to make sure we step up to the plate.\u00a0</p><p>And it has to be bipartisan. You know, the Constitution is bipartisan. The responsibility to this nation is not partisan. We have allowed ourselves to fall off into a lot of partisanism.</p><p>             On partisanship in Congress:          </p><p>             Zakrzewski: You've talked a lot about STEM education and efforts to stay focused on innovation and the future in Congress. But at this politically divided moment in Washington, as impeachment really heats up, do you think that there's bipartisan will in Congress to pass some of these measures that you've mentioned?\u00a0</p><p>             Johnson: Ninety-five\u00a0percent of the legislation that has come out of my committee has been very bipartisan. We are focused on that. It should not be partisan. Technology is not partisan. Technology doesn't see what color or what gender, and nor should we be worried about that other than inclusiveness. We are continuing to work together as a committee. We have a very robust committee. Very bright, some new minds and some returning members. But we've got new energy, new interest. And we are covering the areas of interest. I can't say we will get the attention we deserve, but we are doing hard work, and it's hard work that's going to matter in the future.\u00a0</p><p>             On how the United States should think about artificial intelligence and automation:\u00a0          </p><p>             Slen: Is it important that the U.S.beats China when it comes to artificial intelligence?</p><p>             Johnson: It's important that we keep pace, and hopefully sometimes we'll lead. But we're not investing the same amount of time nor money in the research to keep up with China. That is a concern that I have. We cannot dream and assume that we can keep up without those investments.\u00a0</p><p>             Zakrzewski: Last [week] at the Democratic debate, automation was a key issue that came up. One presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur from New York, has been proposing a universal basic income to address the changes in work that AI might bring to the U.S. economy. What do you think of those proposals for a universal basic income?\u00a0</p><p>             Johnson: That's an idea we need to entertain. I'm not going to shut the door on any idea of that sort. Because we are challenged by our future. We in this country are losing ground. We cannot afford that. We have got to invest in order to have the returns on the investment.</p><p>             On the future of privacy regulation:\u00a0             Zakrzewski: Earlier this year, there was a lot of discussion about passing a bipartisan federal privacy law by the end of the year, but it seems like those talks have largely deteriorated. But what do you think the chances are that Congress passes federal privacy legislation before the 2020 election?\u00a0</p><p>             Johnson: I can't predict that, but I can tell you I'd never give up. You have to keep trying. And sometimes one day it looks like it's impossible, and it passes the next day. So you just never give up if you know what you're doing is the right thing for the people.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Democrats are struggling to keep up with a flood of incendiary\u00a0online ads from the Trump campaign,\u00a0Matthew Rosenberg and Kevin Roose at the New York Times report. Democrats' lagging social media presence highlights a divide between older operatives who are hesitant to take a page out of Trump's playbook and younger campaign staff who are pushing for more edgy advertisements.       </p><p>          Even as Democrats investigate the president for impeachment, Trump's campaign has been able to use the scandal to its advantage, running a variety of ads experimenting with attacks on Biden, including one that made false allegations that the former vice president threatened to withhold foreign aid from Ukraine if it didn't end an investigation into his son. Biden, in contrast, has drastically dialed back his online advertising.       </p><p>          \"We see much less of that kind of experimentation with the Democratic candidates,\" said Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University who tracks political advertising on Facebook, told the Times. \"They're running fewer ads. We don't see the wide array of targeting.\" Edelson compared Trump's lead to a \"a supercar racing a little Volkswagen Bug.\"       </p><p>          Meanwhile, digital consultants focused on helping Democrats win online report pushback against ads that might be perceived as overly provocative or as clickbait. But that strategy could be a losing one online. While Facebook denies that negative ads do better on the platform, its refusal to remove false ads seems to have given negative attacks like those from the Trump campaign an advantage, Matthew and Kevin report.       </p><p>          \"There's an algorithmic bias that inherently benefits hate and negativity and anger,\" Shomik Dutta, a digital strategist and a founder of Higher Ground Labs, an incubator for Democratic start-ups, told the New York Times. \"If anger has an algorithmic bias, then Donald Trump is the captain of that ship.\"       </p><p>             NIBBLES: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) admitted last night that he has been running the undercover Twitter account\u00a0\"Pierre Delecto,\"my colleague Allyson Chiu writes.\u00a0          </p><p>             Slate reporter Ashley Feinberg connected the account to the former presidential candidate after he told the Atlantic he had a secret Twitter account to monitor political chatter.\u00a0\"C'est moi,\" Romney told McKay Coppins, who wrote\u00a0the Atlantic story, after being asked about Delecto.</p><p>The 72-year-old senator brought up his covert Twitter account with the Atlantic as he discussed Trump lashing out at him on social media. Romney said the account follows only 668 people, including journalists, comedians and athletes.\u00a0\"He explained that he uses a secret Twitter account - 'What do they call me, a\u00a0lurker?'-to keep tabs on the political conversation,\" Coppins wrote.</p><p>Feinberg was able to identify the account with only those few details -- and the assumption that Romney would be using the account to follow\u00a0his family members.\u00a0\"Romney, a known family man, would want to keep close tabs on his offspring,\" wrote Feinberg, who also discovered that former FBI director James B. Comey was on Twitter using the alias \"Reinhold Niebuhr.\" Feinberg focused on a public account belonging to Allie Romney Critchlow, the senator's oldest grandchild. That account \"has just 481 followers, making digging through them an annoying-but-not-impossible feat,\" Feinberg wrote. She began to look closely at accounts following Critchlow that appeared to be making an effort to conceal their identity. She soon found the Delecto account, which appeared to match up with many of the clues Romney gave the Atlantic.\u00a0</p><p>It's still unknown how Romney chose this pseudonym, but Twitter users were eager to find out.\u00a0</p><p>From NBC reporter Ben Collins:</p><p>And there were plenty of jokes:</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon\u00a0is struggling to make sure third-party sellers aren't shipping customers expired or fraudulent goods as it increasingly pushes into grocery sales, Annie Palmer at CNBC reports. Brands and consumer advocates have\u00a0called out the company for not doing enough to protect consumers, concerns that could factor into Congress's evaluation of the online marketplace's business practices. One data analytics firm told CNBC that 40 percent of the sellers for the top 100 best-selling food items\u00a0had more than five customer complaints about expired goods.</p><p>Amazon told CNBC that third-party sellers are required to provide Amazon with an expiration date if they're selling an item meant for consumption and to guarantee that the item is good for at least 90 more days. But consumer advocates question how consistently the policy is enforced.</p><p>The irregular enforcement has made it difficult for brands hoping to stop third-party sellers from reselling expired products from their company. Baby formula and children's nutrition company Abbott Laboratories told CNBC that it is dedicating more of its own resources to spot fraudulent and expired listings, including testing third-party products.</p><p>Amazon says it uses artificial intelligence to try to catch repeat offenders, but that Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of public policy, said that \"bad actors are constantly attempting to evade our automatic tools and review procedures.\" (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             -- Civil rights and consumer advocates are raising concerns that the Housing Department's\u00a0proposal to change a key rule\u00a0would make it harder for tenants to sue housing providers that use discriminatory algorithms in renting and advertising properties. The rule, which has yet to go into effect, vastly misunderstands how algorithms work and would walk back years of housing rights upheld by the agency, 24 civil rights and consumer protection groups wrote to the agency on Friday.</p><p>\"Algorithmic bias is generally difficult to detect, and these defenses would prevent plaintiffs from standing up for themselves,\" Spandana Singh, policy analyst at New America's Open Technology Institute, one of the signing groups, said in an emailed statement.\u00a0</p><p>HUD's new rule would let housing providers off the hook if they can show that the algorithm they use is \"produced, maintained, or distributed\" by a third party that meets industry standards. But advocates point out that there is virtually no industry standard when it comes to preventing algorithmic discrimination.\u00a0For instance, Facebook, one of the biggest online housing advertisers, was criticized by HUD and housing rights advocates before committing to updating\u00a0its policies earlier this year. Just last month, its algorithms were implicated in a discrimination lawsuit brought against seven Washington-area housing companies.</p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg spoke to Fox News' Dana Perino about censorship, conservative bias, calls to break up Big Tech,\u00a0and the 2020 elections on Friday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-6cd39a8693e44c21b076d09e197ec869</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB0-FS11-DXKP-J02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2181\"/><timeReceived>1:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The watchdog this morning announced the latest probe, which is into Quantcast, a U.S.-based advertising tech veteran.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Europe's General Data Protection Regulation went into effect almost a year ago, and the outcomes of these investigations will reveal whether the new rules have teeth.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have reason to believe then clearly that there are potential infringements of the GDPR arising,\" Dixon said at the hearing. \"We are significantly advanced in a number of those investigations and intend to bring a decision and an outcome on those investigations.\"</p><p>             The sheer number of\u00a0probes highlights\u00a0how the European regulators are increasingly emerging as the de facto top cop of American tech companies -- when\u00a0there are still divisions in Congress over what a federal privacy law should encompass in the U.S.          </p><p>             Ireland's commission hasn't yet brought any fines against U.S. tech firms under the new European regulatory regime\u00a0- but any penalties it pursues could be as much as 4 percent of a company's annual worldwide revenue.          </p><p>Ireland is charged with overseeing the enforcement of GDPR when it comes to most technology companies because many have their European headquarters in the country. Dixon testified that Internet platforms are among the top sources of\u00a0complaints to the commission. Other sectors that receive the most complaints\u00a0include\u00a0banking and telecommunications.\u00a0</p><p>As the one-year mark of GDPR looms, the country's role in enforcing the law has come under scrutiny as critics wonder why the commission has not yet brought fines against any companies. Dixon told yesterday's panel it's taking time because the \"sanctions are significant\" and the commission needs to give companies the opportunity to respond at various steps in the process.\u00a0</p><p>             Still, their relative organization is striking since there has been little motion in Washington toward achieving a privacy bill.\u00a0Lawmakers remain divided over issues including whether individuals should be able to sue companies over perceived privacy violations and\u00a0how much authority to grant to the Federal Trade Commission to to penalize companies that violate consumers' privacy.\u00a0</p><p>And Democrats want to ensure that a federal bill would not water down or pre-empt strong state privacy laws, such as the one in\u00a0California slated to take effect next year.\u00a0During yesterday's panel, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said every American's privacy rights should be just as strong as residents of California. The consumer advocates on the panel agreed that law should be viewed as a floor -- not a ceiling -- for any legislation Congress considers.</p><p>             Still, many in Big Tech say they are on board with some kind of rules -- signaling the pressure the companies are under to show they're taking consumer privacy seriously. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have been\u00a0calling\u00a0on the United States to adopt federal privacy legislation similar to the GDPR.\u00a0The technology industry is warming up to the European regime and even prefers it to a federal law that takes after California's privacy bill, or an outcome where it would need to navigate a patchwork of state rules.\u00a0</p><p>Republicans have also raised concerns that a patchwork of different state privacy laws could be a compliance nightmare for the companies and hinder innovation.\u00a0</p><p>             And the U.S. will also face a test for the enforcement of its own existing rules\u00a0soon.\u00a0Federal Trade Commission is in negotiations with Facebook over a multi-billion dollar fine that would settle the agency's probe into Facebook's privacy practices. After Wall Street shrugged off Facebook's announcement it was setting aside billions for such a fine last week, many critics said it's time for the U.S. to get tougher and consider stronger remedies when tech giants violate consumers' privacy.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The rise of foreign money rushing into venture capital funds and startups has transformed Silicon Valley into a \"geopolitical minefield,\" Recode's\u00a0Theodore Schleifer reports.\u00a0Start-ups and venture capitalists are making judgement calls or reacting to crosscurrents that the tech industry didn't have to worry about decades ago.\u00a0          </p><p>\"It's the world of geopolitics coming to venture,\" Robert Ackerman, a venture capitalist active in cybersecurity, told Theodore. \"It's got a lot more gray than black and white - and we're all trying to figure that out.\"</p><p>As China and Saudi Arabia cash bolsters a recent gold rush in Silicon Valley, companies are grappling with how to respond to the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi or whether Chinese telecommunications company Huawei poses a national security threat.</p><p>\"But for too long, most people in Silicon Valley have treated foreign cash with a collective shrug, seeing money as money and not truly considering the ethical and regulatory challenges of taking investment from certain foreign countries, Recode interviews with more than 50 venture capitalists, startups, lawyers, and others involved in cross-border investing reveal,\" Theodore writes. \"Now Silicon Valley is scrambling to assess its own exposure in this new world order.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: As it negotiates a settlement with Facebook to conclude its privacy probe, the FTC may require the social network to place \"privacy-minded\" executives at the company's highest levels,\u00a0Politico's Nancy Scola reports.\u00a0The steps would be in addition to a multi-billion dollar fine.\u00a0          </p><p>The steps could include appointing a federally-approved privacy official and creating an independent privacy oversight board.

Today the spotlight will be on Google, but any large technology company is at risk.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 40 attorneys general led by Ken Paxton from Texas plan to announce an antitrust investigation into Google later today\u00a0from the steps of the Supreme Court, my colleague Tony Romm reports. Their investigation will focus on the ways Google maintains its dominance as the top search giant,\u00a0particularly when it comes to collecting data and advertising.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             But the attorneys general made clear they are taking a multipronged approach:\u00a0Eight states and the District of Columbia announced on Friday that they would open an antitrust probe into Facebook, which has acquired\u00a0social media platforms\u00a0Instagram and WhatsApp.\u00a0And they could also widen their work to include other companies such as Amazon, which is also facing antitrust scrutiny at the federal level and has been criticized for promoting its own products over competitors on a platform it controls.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm quite concerned how they [Amazon] will reap info from other buyers who use their facility and then go into business against those same people,\" Keith Ellison, a Democratic attorney general from Minnesota, told Tony.\u00a0(Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>When Tony asked whether states plan to announce a probe of the e-commerce giant, Ellison\u00a0added: \"The AGs are talking about all of Big Tech. ... I'll say Amazon is on the radar screens of a lot of people but not prepared to announce [anything].\"</p><p>             The flurry of activity\u00a0highlights how states are taking on the charge of policing Big Tech as Washington has been slow to regulate the industry, even in the wake of high profile privacy scandals and revelations that Russian actors exploited social media to influence the 2016 election.          </p><p>             The timing is especially interesting given how lawmakers and the Trump administration have dramatically ramped up antitrust scrutiny of Silicon Valley in recent months -- signaling some states think the federal government is unlikely to actually get anything done.\u00a0          </p><p>\"They need to be regulated,\" Ellison also told Tony, \"and my view is, it's the state AGs job to do it, particularly when the federal government is not necessarily a reliable partner in the area.\"</p><p>Top competition officials at both the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have said that the states are working cooperatively with the federal government, even as some state attorneys general complain that Washington is moving too slowly, Tony reports.</p><p>             Now the tech industry is now bracing for an antitrust war on multiple fronts.\u00a0Just on Friday, Google acknowledged for the first time that it is the target of a federal competition probe as the Justice Department requested records tied to previous antitrust investigations. Facebook has said it is subject to a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigation. As Congress returns this week for its fall session, both the House and Senate are gearing up for hearings on antitrust issues in the technology sector that will likely increase the public spotlight on the issue.\u00a0</p><p>Though the federal government has the most powerful tools at its disposal when it comes to addressing competition, Tony notes that states have been effective in creating changes within other industries. For example, they forced tobacco companies to pay billions in health claims and to pay for an anti-smoking campaign.\u00a0</p><p>             The broad nature of the states' antitrust action - which in the case of the Google investigation\u00a0includes a huge chunk of America and is bipartisan - could also lend more legitimacy to action at the federal level. As I reported in last week's Technology 202, the state investigations could lend bipartisan credibility to actions that the FTC and DOJ are taking at a time when President Trump has been aggressively attacking Silicon Valley titans.\u00a0</p><p>The companies they say they will cooperate with the state enforcers.\u00a0\"Google's services help people every day, create more choices for consumers, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the country,\" Google spokesman Jose Castaneda told Tony. \"We look forward to working with the attorneys general to answer questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector.\"</p><p>For its part, Facebook argued that it's not stifling competition because people have multiple choices for each of the services it provides.\u00a0\"We understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform,\" said\u00a0Will Castleberry, the company's vice president of\u00a0state and local policy. \"This underscores the competition we face, not only in the U.S. but around the globe. We will work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\"\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: China Labor Watch, a nonprofit advocacy group, accused Apple and its manufacturing partner Foxconn of a series of worker violations in Chinese factories, including withholding bonus payments and employing more temporary workers than allowed by Chinese law,\u00a0my colleague Reed Albergotti reports.\u00a0</p><p>The report drew from observations and documents collected by undercover investigators working at the largest Chinese iPhone factory in Zhengzhou. Apple employed one of the investigators for four years, the group said.</p><p>Apple spokeswoman Lori Lodes denied most of the report's accusations, but she acknowledged that Apple did exceed the number of contract workers allowed by the country's law, which can't exceed 10 percent. Contract workers are paid overtime, but they do not receive many other benefits of full-time workers. \"We have confirmed all workers are being compensated appropriately, including any overtime wages and bonuses, all overtime work was voluntary and there was no evidence of forced labor,\" Lodes said.</p><p>Foxconn also admitted to hiring more contract workers than it is permitted to under Chinese law, but it denied engaging in other practices such as forced labor or withholding worker bonuses in a statement to Reed.\u00a0</p><p>The advocacy group says Apple is engaging in problematic labor costs as it seeks to curb costs to head off expenses related to tariffs on its products. \"Apple is now transferring costs from the trade war through their suppliers to workers and profiting from the exploitation of Chinese Workers,\" the report reads.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Microsoft President Brad Smith came out against a decades-old legal shield that provides tech companies immunity for the content people post on their websites, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Smith's remarks highlight that the tech industry's interests in Washington aren't monolithic, and it will likely put the Washington tech giant at odds with Silicon Valley social media companies that have business models that are more reliant on the law.\u00a0          </p><p>          \"Section 230 had a place and time, but that time is now over,\" Smith told my colleague Jay Greene in a recent interview.</p><p>          While both Republicans and Democrats have expressed concerns with the law, Smith is the rare CEO to come out against it. The Internet Association, a lobbying group that represents tech giants - including Microsoft, Facebook, and Google - has\u00a0argued\u00a0that gutting the law would stymie innovation.\u00a0But Smith, who has also become a familiar face on the Hill advocating for policy solutions to issues in the industry surrounding privacy, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, says tech companies need to do more to stop their tools from being used for bad deeds.       </p><p>          \"Digital technology has become both a tool and a weapon, and we need to address that head on,\" Smith told Jay. \"And part of addressing it head on starts with really understanding the different ways in which it's either serving humanity or being weaponized.\"       </p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0             Joichi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, stepped down on Saturday following increased scrutiny over his role in concealing financial ties\u00a0between the lab and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein,\u00a0Marc Tracy and Tiffany Hsu at the New York Times report. His resignation follows a New Yorker investigation\u00a0released Friday that detailed how Epstein directed contributions to the lab far exceeding the amounts previously disclosed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.       </p><p>          Despite being \"disqualified\" by MIT as a donor, the Media Lab continued to accept funds from Epstein,\u00a0Ronan Farrow at the New Yorker found. \"The effort to conceal the lab's contact with Epstein was so widely known that some staff in the office of the lab's director, Joi Ito, referred to Epstein as Voldemort or 'he who must not be named,' \" Ronan\u00a0reports.\u00a0       </p><p>          Emails obtained by the New Yorker credited Epstein with facilitating high-profile donations, including a $2 million donation from Bill Gates. \"Any claim that Epstein directed any programmatic or personal grant making for Bill Gates is completely false,\" a representative for Bill Gates told the Times. Ito also resigned from the boards of the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the New York Times Company.       </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             The nearly half-million U.S. businesses that will have to comply with a new California privacy law protecting consumer data are scrambling to make their digital operations compliant by Jan. 1,the Wall Street Journal's Patience Haggin reports. Because companies store customer data across multiple platforms, many are rushing\u00a0to find tools that can help them collect all the data in one place.\u00a0       </p><p>\"You have to find a way to capture all that information and track it so you know what's happening with that information,\" said Dan Koslofsky, associate general counsel for privacy and data security at the Gap, told Patience. \"And that's a pretty significant undertaking for most companies.\"</p><p>          The law will probably will\u00a0hit data vendors and digital advertisers the hardest, Patience reports, but it could also provide new business for firms such as Microsoft, which is one of several firms developing compliance software.       </p><p>          While many of the biggest companies affected by the law had a head start in taking similar preparations to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that went into effect last year, smaller California companies that pushed off fixes waiting for California lawmakers to iron out details may not make the 2020 deadline - a concern for some businesses given the up to $7,500 fine per violation.       </p><p>             - More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming soon:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-bba08a094f204f1bb210d7b874b301fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X11-NF41-JB4M-V4BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1843\"/><timeReceived>1:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook said the campaign - which appeared to have some links to Russia's Internet Research Agency - bore many similarities to the tactics that the Kremlin used ahead of the 2016 election.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Biden's quick jump on fundraising\u00a0shows it's not just tech companies that are in a position of relative strength since the\u00a0last presidential election.\u00a0While Hillary Clinton was targeted with similar tactics during the 2016 election, much of the details about the Russian campaign on social media did not become available until after election day. Biden now has the opportunity to fight back - and maybe even win the messaging war -\u00a0before the primary vote.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             And Facebook, too, is fighting to prove it has learned from its mistakes in 2016 and is intervening against election interference earlier. The company's blitz of security announcements seemed timed to get ahead of chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's\u00a0hotly anticipated hearing on Capitol Hill tomorrow - and show the company is responding effectively to potential threats to\u00a0U.S. elections.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0\"That we've been able to proactively identify [accounts seeking to influence the election]\u00a0and take them down is somewhat of a signal that our systems are much more advanced now than they have been in the past,\" Zuckerberg said during an interview that aired with NBC's Lester Holt last night.\u00a0</p><p>             But as Facebook's systems grown more sophisticated, so do the bad actors' tactics:\u00a0The Russian network targeted Americans in swing states, largely with posts on Facebook-owned Instagram about\u00a0divisive political issues and presidential candidates, my colleagues Tony Romm and Isaac Stanley-Becker report. It was one of four campaigns that Facebook announced it removed yesterday, including three misleading campaigns from Iran.</p><p>\"They are highly sophisticated,\" Zuckerberg said. \"They signal that these nation-states intend to be active in the upcoming elections.\"</p><p>The Russian accounts relied heavily on memes, Tony and Isaac report. That could pose a greater challenge to social networks, researchers told my colleagues.\u00a0</p><p>\"To steal a phrase, a picture is worth a thousand words, and meme-based content is still extremely effective and much harder to detect,\"\u00a0said Graham Brookie, the director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.</p><p>             They also continued to show an in-depth understanding of U.S. politics, as my colleagues wrote yesterday: \"The operation demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the schisms within the Democratic Party as it labors to choose a nominee to face Trump in 2020. One Russian account, which portrayed itself as a black voter in Michigan, used the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag to hammer Biden for gaffes about racial issues. Some of the accounts boosted one of his rivals on the left, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\"</p><p>Ben Nimmo, a researcher at the social media analysis firm Graphika, said the Russian actors tried not to be detected by reposting content from real users, including Sanders. He detailed some of the firm's findings on Twitter:</p><p>The Russian campaign appeared to be in the early stages and still building an audience when Facebook took it down, Graphika found. 246,000 accounts followed one or more of the inauthentic Russian accounts, which had collectively made just fewer than 75,000 posts, according to Graphika's report.\u00a0</p><p>             Expect Zuckerberg to make the case to Congress that Facebook has learned from its election security efforts around the world over the past three years.\u00a0          </p><p>\"We face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation states like Russia, Iran, and China, but I'm confident that we're more prepared now because we've played a role in defending against election interference in more than 200 elections around the world since 2016, including the French Presidential Election, the German Federal Election, the U.S. Midterms and Mexico and India, and the E.U, and we see much cleaner results,\" Zuckerberg told reporters on a call yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook also announced yesterday that it was making some incremental changes around election security. Facebook is:</p><p>But it remains to be seen if Facebook's election security blitz will be enough to assuage lawmakers' concerns. Democrats have questioned Facebook's commitment to fighting election disinformation following the platform's decision to not fact-check politicians' ads -- especially those from President Trump, whom they accuse of spreading\u00a0baseless claims against Biden and his son's dealings\u00a0in Ukraine.</p><p>Biden's campaign praised Facebook for the account takedowns but questioned Facebook's commitment to election integrity.\u00a0\"Unfortunately, like the Kremlin, Donald Trump continues to benefit from spreading false information, [and] all the while Facebook profits from amplifying his lies and debunked conspiracy theories on their platform,\" TJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said in a statement to my colleagues. \"If Facebook is truly committed to protecting the integrity of our elections, they would immediately take down Trump's ads that attempt to gaslight the American people.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang thinks Facebook should act like a cable network and be held accountable when politicians use the platform to disseminate ads containing lies.\u00a0          </p><p> \"It would be wholly appropriate for them to say, 'Look, we know we're a platform that disseminates a ton of the information that voters are getting, and it's irresponsible for us to air political ads that we know aren't true,'\" Yang said to reporters before a Washington Post Live event yestrday. \"So they should at this point accept that responsibility and say we should treat ourselves like a cable network with that discretion, and you should hold us accountable for anything we air that is patently false.\"</p><p>The New York entrepreneur is just the latest 2020 candidate to take aim at Facebook's policy not to fact-check politicians' ads, joining Biden and former Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). But he disagreed with Sen. Kamala Harris on social media, who has called for Twitter to suspend Trump's account amid concerns the president's language incites violence. He said there's little Twitter can do now that Trump is president.</p><p> \"I think now the argument to suspend his account is very, very hard to make, because he's clearly the most prominent public figure in America and saying that he shouldn't have a Twitter account seems very hard to support,\" Yang said.\u00a0\"If there was a time, it was before 2016.\"</p><p>Yang laid out his views on social media and political speech during a wide-ranging conversation where he positioned himself as a tech-savvy candidate, who would benefit from the expertise of funders like Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He criticized the current state of tech regulation in Washington, poking fun at Congress's performance during hearings with Zuckerberg in 2018.\u00a0</p><p> \"America thinks that our government doesn't understand technology,\" he said. \"We got rid the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995, which was 24 years ago. We all saw the questioning of Mark Zuckerberg when he showed up to Congress, and the joke I make is\u00a0that wasn't a surprise visit.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) are introducing\u00a0legislation today that would require social media giants such as Facebook to\u00a0allow consumers to transfer their data to rival tech services. The new bill could provide lawmakers seeking to break up the grip of big tech companies a more moderate alternative to fully dismantling tech giants.          </p><p>\"By allowing social media users to easily move their data or to continue to communicate with their friends after switching platforms, start-ups will be able to compete on equal terms with the big behemoths,\" Warner said in a statement.</p><p>In addition to allowing users to carry their data to other platforms, the Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act would require companies with more than\u00a0100 million users to provide interoperability for competing communications platforms. Users would get to chose a third-party service tasked with maintaining their data. \"This bill will help put consumers in the driver's seat when it comes to how and where they use social media,\" Warner said.</p><p>The bill, which the trio hope to pass alongside broader privacy legislation now being considered by Congress, has drawn support from consumer rights advocates.\u00a0\"We're thrilled to see a concrete legislative proposal to provide interoperability for consumers,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge. \"Interoperability ensures that users benefit from increased competition, and it helps new competitors grow by reaching users that are locked in to their current provider.\"</p><p>CNN's Brian Fung notes that tech platforms, including Facebook, support the concept in theory:</p><p>             BYTES: TikTok removed propaganda videos promoting Islamic State militants and suspended\u00a0approximately two dozen accounts responsible for spreading the content after the Wall Street Journal flagged the videos,Georgia Wells at the Wall Street Journal reports. TikTok's struggle to rein in terrorist content as its global user base explodes could worsen tensions with U.S. lawmakers critical of the Chinese company's moderation practices.</p><p>The videos appeared to target TikTok's overwhelmingly teenage audience. Videos paired flower icons and heart filters with images of Islamic State fighters and propaganda songs.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is an industry-wide challenge complicated by bad actors who actively seek to circumvent protective measures, but we have a team dedicated to aggressively protecting against malicious behavior on TikTok,\" TikTok told the Journal. \"We continuously develop ever-stronger controls to proactively detect suspicious activity.\"</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet\u00a0have also been criticized in the past for the spread of Islamic State content, responding with increased moderation efforts, automated technologies and a shared database that allows companies to share terrorist content.</p><p>                          -- Zuckerberg said during a call with reporters yesterday that his private recommendations for potential hires to South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) for his presidential campaign did not reflect an endorsement.\u00a0                    </p><p>          \"I think this should probably not be misconstrued as if I'm like deeply involved in trying to support their campaign or something like that,\" Zuckerberg told reporters.\u00a0       </p><p>          Earlier this year, both Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan sent emails to Buttigieg's campaign manager with recommendations for potential staff,\u00a0Tyler Pager and Kurt Wagner at Bloomberg News reported. Two people they recommended were hired, Buttigieg's campaign spokesman Chris Meagher confirmed.\u00a0       </p><p>          Zuckerberg\u00a0told reporters he has \"a number of mutual friends\" with Buttigieg from their overlapping time at Harvard University. Zuckerberg visited South Bend in April 2017 and did a live-stream with the mayor.       </p><p>          Warren, who is a fierce Facebook critic,\u00a0declined to comment on the story when asked by reporters, but she took a shot at Facebook's influence in Washington.       </p><p>          \"They already have way too much influence in Washington and they are helping drive every conversation in a way that will protect Mark Zuckerberg and his company.\"       </p><p>Yang also responded.\u00a0\"To me, if someone like Mark Zuckerberg recommends a staffer to you, then you should assume that you should take a look at that person because they are probably very smart and good at their job and have very relevant expertise,\" he said at a Post event yesterday. \"So to me, it would have been surprising if Pete didn't take a look at those staffers or potential staffers.\"</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - More news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-91f685074b864334994e6ab8a31af74f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB6-DNW1-JB4M-V0S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2096\"/><timeReceived>1:12 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There's a growing debate over whether tech companies should continue to have such protections at home, and they're wary of allowing the controversial language to expand abroad.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, and Rep. Greg Walden (Ore.), the\u00a0committee's top Republican, called out the Trump administration for failing to\u00a0heed requests to consult the committee before including language similar to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in future trade agreements. Their criticism came as Robert Lighthizer, the Trump administration's trade representative, turned down an invitation to testify\u00a0on the future of the provision alongside academics, activists and tech companies such as Google and Reddit.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lighthizer played point in the negotiations for\u00a0the new NAFTA -- known as USMCA -- which are currently being considered in Congress, though stalled because of impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Section 230 language, which\u00a0protects tech companies from lawsuits for content people post on their sites, is included in that agreement.</p><p>\"Including provisions in trade agreements that are controversial to both Democrats and Republicans is not the way to get support from Congress, obviously,\" Pallone said at the hearing. \"Hopefully the ambassador will be more responsive to bipartisan requests in the future.\"</p><p>The pair of lawmakers initially sent Lighthizer a letter raising concerns about the inclusion of language similar to Section 230 in trade agreements while the committee is considering drafting changes to the legal provision. They asked Lighthizer not to include such language in future trade agreements -- and\u00a0were dismayed to learn\u00a0it was also included in a trade deal with Japan.\u00a0</p><p>We're \"very frustrated about that and I hope the administration is paying attention and listening, because they haven't up until this point on this matter,\" Walden said.\u00a0</p><p>             The digs highlight how Section 230's future is growing increasingly uncertain in the United States. Members of Congress are getting more serious about understanding\u00a0how Section 230 works and potentially amending it as worries mount the provision is being abused to foster harmful content online.\u00a0          </p><p>There's bipartisan interest in amending the law to address a host of concerns -- ranging from the social media platforms' shortcomings when it comes to moderating hate speech, election disinformation and\u00a0the online sale of drugs like opioids. In the Senate, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) has proposed changing Section 230\u00a0to address allegations that the tech companies are biased against conservatives.\u00a0</p><p>Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who chairs the House Energy subcommittee on consumer protection and commerce, said she doesn't want Section 230 language in the USMCA.</p><p>\"\"There is no place for that,\" she said. \"I think the laws in these other countries don't accommodate what the U.S. has done about 230.\"</p><p>\"In the midst of that conversation because of all the new developments, I think it is just inappropriate right now to insert this liability protection into trade agreements,\" she added.</p><p>David McCabe and Ana Swanson of the New York Times illustrated why the stakes are so high. He reports that American negotiators have proposed similar language in pacts with the European Union, Britain and members of the World Trade Organization.</p><p> \"The administration's push is the latest salvo in a global fight over who sets the rules for the internet,\" David and Ana\u00a0write.\u00a0\"While the rules for trading goods have largely been written - often by the United States - the world has far fewer standards for digital products. Countries are rushing into this vacuum, and in most cases writing regulations that are far more restrictive than the tech industry would prefer.\"</p><p>Technology companies have argued that such language is a boon to the U.S. economy, according to Bloomberg News.</p><p>\"Failing to include these protections - which have been a part of U.S. law for two decades - in trade agreements would negatively impact the countless small businesses and entrepreneurs that use online platforms to export and advertise their businesses,\" Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, told Bloomberg News in a statement.</p><p>Schakowsky challenged Reddit chief executive Steven Huffman on his defense of including Section 230 language in trade agreements. He called Section 230 \"uniquely American\" in his opening remarks -- and she said that underscored why the United States should be cautious about including it in trade deals.\u00a0</p><p>But Michael Petricone, the head of government affairs at industry group CTA, said that's exactly why the United States should include\u00a0protections in such agreements. From Twitter:</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Facecbook co-founder Chris Hughes and the Economic Security Project -- the organization he chairs -- are launching a $10 million \"anti-monopoly fund,\"my colleague Tony Romm writes. The fund signals the next step in Hughes's campaign against corporate consolidation following his high-profile call to break up the social network he co-founded earlier this year.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0A\u00a0series of high-profile philanthropies, including the George Soros-financed Open Society Foundations and the Omidyar Network, created by a founder of eBay, are backing the initiative. Tony writes Hughes and his allies want the funding to capture\u00a0the greater antitrust scrutiny\u00a0around big tech into \"a broader movement\" and take a closer look at potential monopolies in sectors like agriculture, health care and other industries.\u00a0</p><p>The new fund intends to highlight competition and \"move the issue from the margins to the mainstream,\" Hughes said in an interview with Tony.</p><p>\"You don't need a degree in economics to know corporations and the wealthy have had a heavy hand in setting a lot of economic [policy] over the past several decades,\" he added.</p><p>Hughes is announcing his expanded war chest as his call to break up Facebook are getting more attention -- both in Washington and in the industry. Democrats spent a significant amount of time debating Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.)\u00a0plan to break up large tech companies at the Democratic debate in Ohio earlier this week.\u00a0</p><p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff joined calls to break up Facebook in an interview with CNN yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's addictive, it's not good for you, they're after your kids, they're running political ads that aren't true ... and they're also acquiring other companies and co-mingling [data those companies have on their users] into theirs,\" Benioff told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview promoting his new book.\u00a0\"And I think at that point, because they're now doing that, that they probably should be broken up. Because they're having an undue influence as the largest social media platform on the planet,\" he said.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, yesterday,\u00a0Christopher Stern and Ashley Gold at The Information reported. Facebook wouldn't say what Zuckerberg and Waters discussed, but Zuckerberg will appear in front of the Financial Services Committee next week as the sole witness for a hearing on Facebook's impact on the financial services and housing sector.</p><p>Lawmakers probably will address concerns over Facebook's cryptocurrency project Libra, which has been at the center of intense regulator scrutiny since a plan to launch it was announced\u00a0in June. Waters and other lawmakers asked about the technology's potential for money laundering, fraud and abuse during a July hearing.\u00a0Waters has asked the company to halt its plans for the cryptocurrency until lawmakers can fully assess the project.</p><p>Zuckerberg will give a live-streamed speech about free speech today at Georgetown University. This is his second trip to Washington in less than a month; he last met with lawmakers in September to discuss Internet regulation.</p><p>             BYTES: The CEO of location technology company Foursquare is urging Congress to pass regulations to prevent widespread abuse of user location data. Giving apps unfettered access to user location data - which can then be sold to third parties such as bounty hunters - is a \"recipe for abuse,\" Foursquare CEO Jeff Glueck wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed.\u00a0Foursquare is just the latest tech company to actively seek congressional regulation, a move that some critics suggest is a means of getting ahead of tougher policies.       </p><p>While some companies, including Apple, have made efforts to increase user awareness of when apps are collecting their location data, transparency is far from a common industry practice. Glueck recommends that lawmakers mandate companies tell users how their location data is being used. Moreover, he says that companies need to make it \"easy for users to opt out at any time.\" Foursquare contractually mandates its partners to ask users to opt in for data sharing, Glueck writes.</p><p>Glueck, who warns Congress that \"any reform that is overly burdensome on smaller companies, for instance, will only strengthen behemoths like Google and Facebook, putting challengers out of business and reducing innovation,\" seems to be punching up at the data-collection practices of larger companies.       </p><p>The CEO also pitched a \"do no harm\" principle, similar to the one used in the medical field, that\u00a0would prevent location data from being \"used to gouge consumers or deny them access to basic life services like loans, health care, insurance, employment, civil rights and educational opportunities.\"</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p><p>Trump again pushed a\u00a0debunked conspiracy about cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike (the Italian intepreter's expressions are priceless):\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-5a3fa168870346a0b670949e8140a714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-JXH1-DXKP-J388-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1724\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But at a pair of hearings on the Hill this week, they're expected to ratchet up their scrutiny of Silicon Valley's\u00a0content moderation practices.\u00a0\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler\u00a0tells my colleague Tony Romm\u00a0that today's\u00a0hearing on the\u00a0proliferation of white nationalism\u00a0on Facebook and Google's platforms is just a \"first stage\" - he wants to press the companies to take action first before considering new regulations.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Let's see what happens by just pressuring them first,\" the New York Democrat said. \"I'm reluctant to have regulation of speech. It usually goes too far. I don't know we have to get there yet.\"</p><p>On the other side of the Capitol, Republicans\u00a0plan to ramp up criticism of companies' content moderation practices this week - for very different reasons. At a\u00a0Senate Judiciary Committee tomorrow on allegations of anti-conservative bias, expect Republicans repeat claims that Facebook, Google and Twitter are too focused on taking down content online that results in conservative voices and news being suppressed. While there's so far no evidence of systemic bias against conservative content, the drumbeat of criticism could still increase the prospect of regulation - a threat that\u00a0President Trump himself has repeatedly made.</p><p>             The hearings showcase two different manifestations of the forthcoming debate\u00a0in Washington over how to rein in Big Tech\u00a0- and the challenge for the companies. Tech companies are under increasing pressure to show how they will keep people safe - while still preserving free speech. And in a such a politicized environment in Washington, they must also show they are committed to fair treatment of all political parties.\u00a0          </p><p>             Given how complex these challenges are, it likely means that for the foreseeable future technology companies will be forced to navigate\u00a0a patchwork of different rules across the globe governing when they need to take down content.\u00a0          </p><p>The challenge on removing hate speech is only growing as recent incidents like the New Zealand shootings or the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre last year put a spotlight on the ways technology platforms can be exploited to amplify violent and hateful messages online.</p><p>Yet Nadler resisted the idea of gutting the tech industry's prized federal legal shield, which gives the companies broad legal immunity for the content posted on their platforms. The technology industry has fiercely defended Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, even though some critics think its time for the law to be overhauled to address the proliferation of violence and hate speech online today.\u00a0</p><p>\"No, that would be a revolution in how social media works,\" he said.</p><p>\"It says to me that there's a felt need, there's a feeling abroad as well as here that social media has been used for bad purposes, has been used to promote racist or hateful doctrines and hate speech,\" Nadler said.</p><p>Australia recently passed a law that could result in jail time for executives at companies that leave violent content online. In the United Kingdom, lawmakers unveiled a broad blueprint for how they could fine companies for failing to takedown a broad range of harmful speech, from violent content to disinformation. As the U.K. and Australia become some of the first countries to consider such regulations, their actions could influence how policymakers around the world broach content moderation issues.</p><p>\"If we can put in place a system of regulation that is sensible,\" U.K. digital minister Jeremy Wright told Tony in a recent interview. \"We won't be the only country to want to do that.\"</p><p>             Other Democrats on the committee seemed open to considering regulations to address problematic content\u00a0on the platforms.\u00a0Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) told Tony regulations should be examined. Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) told him that regulation may be necessary to govern how companies address harmful content. He said\u00a0technology companies should play a role in shaping what that regulation should look like and pitch a proposal.\u00a0\"They better go do it because what they don't want is for us to do it, because we're not going to get it right,\" Richmond said.\u00a0\"We're going to make it swift, we're going to make it strong and we're going to hold them very accountable.\"</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: A bipartisan duo called on the Federal Trade Commission to \"take action\" against Facebook and Google over potential data security and competition violations, The Hill's\u00a0Emily Birnbaum reports. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) asked the agency\u00a0in a letter if it were investigating Google, and they called on the FTC to provide the public with more details about its investigations into internet companies.\u00a0</p><p>\"We understand that the FTC does not typically comment on nonpublic investigations, but the public discussion surrounding Google and other companies' conduct have made this a uniquely important national issue,\" the senators, who both have worked on tech policy issues, wrote in the letter.</p><p>\"Accordingly, we respectfully request that the FTC consider publicly disclosing whether it is conducting an investigation of Google and/or other major online platforms and describe, in general terms, the nature of the conduct under examination in any such investigations,\" they also wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) previously has called for the FTC to investigate Facebook for antitrust violations.

But a bipartisan pair of lawmakers is hoping the legislation has a better chance this session - especially as a Democratic-controlled House increasingly seeks ways to rein in Big Tech's power.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), the chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, and Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), the House Judiciary Committee's top Republican, say they reintroduced\u00a0The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act\u00a0this week. The duo made the case onstage at a Post Live event yesterday that the legislation is needed to level the playing field between tech giants and local news publishers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It grows out of a recognition that we need to do something to give local media, local news publishers the ability to survive,\" Cicilline said at the event.</p><p>Cicilline argues that as ad revenue shifts from news publishers to Facebook and Google, it's time for Congress to intervene. Under current antitrust laws, news publishers are barred from working together as they seek deals with the tech platforms. But under their proposed\u00a0 bill, publishers would\u00a0be granted a four-year safe harbor exempting them from those rules and allowing them to team up to negotiate better deals with tech companbies. That could give publishers more power as they negotiate how their content is distributed, as well as better deal terms around such things as\u00a0revenue splits or content licensing fees.</p><p>             The legislation is back on the table as the tech giants' own efforts to bolster local news are inadvertently drawing attention to the damage their own industry's\u00a0rise has dealt to smaller papers' advertising revenue. As Facebook rolls out its new local news service, the company says\u00a0the service is being hindered by so-called \"news deserts\" where the social network's technicians can't find enough original reporting to make the service work.</p><p>             The bill is the latest signal\u00a0Cicilline is going to use his perch on the House antitrust committee to challenge Facebook and Google. The Rhode Island Democrat\u00a0said it's time to look at the antitrust implications of big tech companies'\u00a0media\u00a0dominance and called for a reexamination of antitrust statutes written in the era of railroad monopolies. \u00a0          </p><p>\"I think this is a moment to do a top to bottom examination of do we need to update and modernize our statutes so that we really are creating an environment for good competition that drives down cost, creates more choices, sparks innovation, Cicilline said. \"And I think we are seeing just the opposite with a lot of Facebook's behavior.\"</p><p>Cicilline also previously called on the Federal Trade Commission to open an antitrust investigation into the social network.</p><p>             But it's unclear if their legislation would have a path forward in the Republican-controlled Senate as\u00a0there is not yet a similar Senate measure. Though it has bipartisan support in the House, Republicans and Democrats appear to have different motivations in supporting the measure. Collins says the bill is about ensuring the survival of local news publishers in his district -- particularly in rural areas. He explained he doesn't think the large technology companies are \"evil.\"\u00a0</p><p> \"So, this is, for me, is saying how do we do this without going in and saying just because they're big, they're bad,\" Collins said. \"In fact, I reject that. I simply say how can we look at the economy to scale and make sure that there's a fair playing field through antitrust.\"</p><p>             The bill is likely to face opposition from the technology companies.\u00a0Anne Kornblut, Facebook's director of new\u00a0initiatives on the news partnerships team at Facebook, said at the event that the social network shares the lawmakers' goal of ensuring that publishers can survive and aren't beholden to traffic from one tech platform. However, Kornblut\u00a0said the company has some concerns. (Kornblut\u00a0worked at The Washington Post until 2015.)</p><p> \"We're in touch with their offices,\" Kornblut said. \"I know our team has some concerns about the specifics of this approach, and my understanding--although I'm not a lawyer--is that it has to do with what it would--what it has historically done for consumers when this kind of regulation has been approached.\"</p><p>          Kornblut also made the case that local news is important to Facebook and that the company can play a role in facilitating local news. The company committed $300 million to support news, with a focus on local reporting, earlier this year.\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>             But not all local outlets are buying that argument. San Francisco Chronicle editor-in-chief Audrey Cooper said at the event that her paper's Facebook referrals dropped by 80% last year when the social network made changes to how news was prioritized on its platform.\u00a0Cooper said she wants to stop seeing a \"disingenuous appreciation of local news\" from Facebook.\u00a0       </p><p>          The company's response to Russian interference and white supremacists on the platform is \"intellectually lazy and has done more to hurt this country in terms of media more than anything else over the last generation,\" Cooper contended.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Google\u00a0canceled its controversial artificial intelligence ethics council following backlash from employees and other high-profile technologists,             Vox's\u00a0Kelsey Piper reports.\u00a0As we reported in a newsletter earlier this week, the company faced a dilemma as employees petitioned the company\u00a0to remove\u00a0the leader of a top conservative think tank on the panel.\u00a0</p><p>More than 2,400 Google employees eventually signed a petition\u00a0calling for the removal of Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James from the council,\u00a0called the Advanced Technology External Advisory Council, earlier this week. The employees opposed James' track record on gender and immigration issues.\u00a0</p><p> \"It's become clear that in the current environment, ATEAC can't function as we wanted,\" the company said in a statement to Vox. \"So we're ending the council and going back to the drawing board. We'll continue to be responsible in our work on the important issues that AI raises, and will find different ways of getting outside opinions on these topics.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeffrey P. Bezos\u00a0and his now ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos disclosed their divorce settlement will leave him with \u00a075% of their\u00a0Amazon stock and voting powers over all of the stock\u00a0they shared,the Washington Post's Craig Timberg and Greg Bensinger report.\u00a0</p><p> \"The announcement from the Bezoses - coming in a tweet from MacKenzie that was retweeted by Jeff - settled a closely watched matter of corporate governance affecting one of the world's richest companies, with a market capitalization of $890 billion, and the\u00a0world's wealthiest person,\" Craig and Greg wrote. \"The record divorce settlement, which also awards Jeff Bezos all of the couple's joint holdings in The Washington Post and a space flight company, Blue Origin, is likely to remove uncertainty around the extent of his continued control over Amazon - a company he founded in 1994 and for which he remains chief executive and its largest shareholder.\"</p><p>With the settlement, MacKenzie Bezos becomes one of the wealthiest women in the world. She owns 4 percent\u00a0of Amazon-- which is worth roughly $36 billion based on the company's market cap yesterday. Jeff Bezos\u00a0retains 12% of the company.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: A federal judge gave Tesla chief executive Elon Musk\u00a0and the Securities and Exchange Commission two weeks to settle the case over Musk's tweets, my colleagues Renae Merle and Faiz Siddiqui\u00a0report.\u00a0</p><p>The agency asked\u00a0the U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt of its settlement after Musk tweeted claims that the company would deliver 500,000 vehicles this year. The SEC contends this violates its previous settlement, which requires Musk to have all tweets about business matters pre-approved so that he does not share information that could mislead investors.

But yesterday, Tesla said it would deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles this year.

The rebuff of the Facebook chief executive's attempted olive branch underscores how messy the social network's regulatory problems could become in Europe. \u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          Thierry Breton, the E.U. commissioner for internal markets and services, and Vera Jourova, the vice president for values and transparency, both expressed skepticism of the social networking titan's pitch for greater regulation of Big Tech after their meetings with him. Zuckerberg yesterday released an op-ed calling for more regulation of the industry in the Financial Times, and Facebook also unveiled a new white paper detailing the company's vision for regulating online content.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          Zuckerberg's playbook is to stay a step ahead of European regulators as they plan to unveil draft artificial intelligence regulations this week and also mull changes to liability rules for online platforms. But E.U. officials are wary of Zuckerberg attempting to pass the buck to regulators as the social network increasingly comes under fire for problematic content on its service, ranging from child exploitation and terrorism to attempts to spread disinformation about elections.       </p><p>          \"Facebook cannot push away all the responsibility,\" because regulations will never solve every problem, Jourova told reporters following the meeting with Zuckerberg, according to the Associated Press. \"It will not be up to governments or regulators to ensure that Facebook wants to be a force of good or bad.\"       </p><p>          Breton meanwhile criticized the new content moderation proposal, which says companies should not be liable for content they host -- but they should be responsible for having standards and systems in place to combat illegal content. Breton, a former telecom executive, told reporters, including the Wall Street Journal, that Facebook's vision \"is too low in terms of responsibility. There are interesting things, but it's not enough.\"       </p><p>             The clashes highlight the increased tensions between American tech titans and the E.U. as it increasingly sets the bar got tech regulation globally. The bloc already showed how its broad privacy regulations could shape a global debate           -             and now tech companies are growing concerned any new effort to regulate artificial intelligence or content moderation could have far-reaching effects on their way of doing business.\u00a0          </p><p>          Zuckerberg is just the latest tech titan to engage in this song and dance. Earlier this month, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai made a similar journey to Brussels and published a strikingly similar call for regulation in the Financial Times's op-ed pages. Apple's senior vice president for artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, has also made an appearance, according to the New York Times.\u00a0</p><p>The European Union's push to regulate artificial intelligence, which could impact facial recognition, self-driving cars and other products that are increasingly core to tech companies' business, is of particular concern. Executives warned that an overly stringent regulatory regime could have unintended consequences, especially on new tech upstarts.\u00a0</p><p>Margrethe Vestager, the executive vice president of the European Commission who has emerged as one of the tech company's top challengers, told the New York Times there needs to be guardrails including privacy protections, rules to prevent discrimination and requirements that ensure companies can explain how the A.I. systems work.</p><p>\"We will do our best to avoid unintended consequences,\" she said to the Times. \"But, obviously, there will be intended consequences.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg also visited with Vestager during his trip. The pair put out a joint statement, which gave little detail about their meeting beyond that the pair \"had a good exchange on current issues in the digital sector.\"</p><p>Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment on the skepticism surrounding Zuckerberg's visit. Zuckerberg said in his op-ed the company is not trying to shirk responsibility by calling for more regulatory action around the world.</p><p>\"To be clear, this isn't about passing off responsibility,\" he wrote. \"Facebook is not waiting for regulation; we're continuing to make progress on these issues ourselves.\"\u00a0</p><p>As Zuckerberg made his pitch to Europe on regulation, it's worth keeping in mind the company's proposals will be scrutinized by policymakers elsewhere, too.\u00a0</p><p>Tech companies are gearing up for a discussion this week about content moderation in Washington. The Department of Justice will tomorrow convene experts for a workshopon Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a legal provision that gives tech platforms immunity for content that people post on their services.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Apple announced yesterday that it won't meet its projected revenue for this quarter because of the coronavirus outbreak,\u00a0             my colleagues Derek Hawkins and Reed Albergotti report.             Apple is the first major U.S. company to reset its projections because of the outbreak, signaling the growing impact of the virus on U.S. companies.\u00a0          </p><p>The coronavirus, which has\u00a0killed more than 1,700, significantly disrupts the global supply chain for the tech industry. Foxconn, a major electronics producer for Apple, said last week that most of its facilities would not be able to resume operations until the end of the month. Apple says closures in China, where the disease originated, have limited production of its iPhones. Tesla also\u00a0reported delays in production because of the virus, and other companies may suffer as the outbreak persists.</p><p>Concerns about growing public health risks associated with the disease have rippled out to major tech gatherings. On Friday, Facebook canceled a marketing summit scheduled to take place in San Francisco in March. IBM pulled out the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco next week, it also announced on Friday.\u00a0Organizers for Mobile World Congress, the biggest gathering in the telecommunications industry, canceled the Barcelona event, citing concerns about the virus two days before that.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos announced the formation of a new fund that will\u00a0provide $10 billion in grants to scientists and activists\u00a0fighting\u00a0climate change,\u00a0             my colleague Kimberly Kindy reports             . The\u00a0fund marks\u00a0Bezos's\u00a0largest commitment to address\u00a0climate change to date - but it may not go far enough to address activists' concerns about the e-commerce giant's carbon footprint.          </p><p>The newly formed Bezos Earth Fund will begin to distribute grants to individuals and organizations around the globe this summer, Bezos said in an announcement on Instagram.\u00a0</p><p>But Bezos continues to face sharp criticism from environmental groups and many of his own employees for the significant environmental footprint of Amazon's e-commerce operations, cloud Web services and work with the oil and gas industry.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Amazon Employees For Climate Justice, a group of employees who have protested the company's environmental practices, said in a statement shared on Twitter:</p><p>Bezos signed a \"climate pledge\" last year that commits Amazon to operate on 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030. Amazon also committed to increase\u00a0its use of electric delivery vehicles and to be\u00a0plastic-free in India by June.</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon Ring, Google Nest and other Internet-connected cameras have given everyone the tools they need to become \"a personal security force,\" my colleague Drew Harwell writes. But many camera owners say it's also alluring to monitor people from afar - and joke that the cameras have enabled them to become voyeurs.\u00a0          </p><p>A Washington Post survey of more than 50 Internet-connected camera users found that many respondents praised the devices for their advertised uses, such as allowing them to check on package deliveries and their pets. They\u00a0also said they were fine with the new levels of surveillance - as long as they were the viewers.\u00a0</p><p>\"They analyzed their neighbors,\" Drew writes. \"They monitored their kids and house guests. And they judged the performance of housekeepers, babysitters and other domestic workers, often without letting them know they were being recorded.\"</p><p>This always-on home surveillance\u00a0comes with a cost. Hackers have peered into childrens' bedrooms, and police officers have asked homeowners for video of their neighbors.</p><p>Most users contacted by The Post told Drew those concerns weren't enough for them to turn off their devices completely. But the suspicion and paranoia stoked by the cameras - as well as recent privacy breaches - have left some users wary.</p><p>\"We're all getting too paranoid. Everybody thinks they're going to be the next victim. And it's set into us this mentality that we have to watch everything and everybody,\" Catherine, a 58-year-old part-time Florida resident who uses a Blink camera to watch her home in Minnesota, told Drew. \"They think, 'If I put all these cameras up, I'll be safe.' Safe from what? ... It's only making them more afraid.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-d9376d1ebbfc46c9a168698c38cf4d79</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7K-40M1-DXKP-J4VX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1590\"/><timeReceived>1:46 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who pressed him on Facebook's ongoing civil rights audit that aims to take stock of the company's policies, content and internal operations.\u00a0Facebook has touted the audit as a signal of its commitment to diversity as it fights\u00a0allegations its\u00a0biased against\u00a0minorities.\u00a0But Zuckerberg stumbled\u00a0as Beatty asked him to name the recommendations from the audit's recent edition. He couldn't name the law firm that is conducting it.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"It's almost like you think this is a joke,\" Beatty slammed. \"When you have ruined the lives of many people, discriminated against them.\"\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zuckerberg also said he didn't know what percentage of Facebook users are African American, even though the congresswoman said he was recently sent a report from Pew Research that included that data.\u00a0</p><p>             \"Maybe you just don't read a lot of things that deal with civil rights and African Americans,\" Beatty added, calling his responses \"appalling and disgusting.\"\u00a0          </p><p>             Zuckerberg's strained responses will only provide more ammunition to critics who say the social network isn't doing enough to keep minorities safe online. Facebook could also see its political headaches intensify amid broad concerns about hate speech on the platform and evidence that African Americans were disproportionately targeted by Russian actors interfering on the company's platforms in the 2016 election.\u00a0          </p><p>             Zuckerberg also couldn't answer questions about diversity among Facebook's partners. Beatty cut him off as the Facebook CEO\u00a0struggled to answer whether any of Facebook's cash is managed by\u00a0diverse-owned companies. He said he didn't know how many of the\u00a0law firms\u00a0with which the company\u00a0works\u00a0are minority-owned, or how many women and minorities work on Facebook's legal cases.\u00a0</p><p>             Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) pressed Zuckerberg on the lack of civil rights experience among the company's senior leadership. Zuckerberg said there are employees with that experience.\u00a0Zuckerberg admitted, however, that he was unaware of\u00a0whether any of the companies Facebook is partnering with to launch its digital currency through the Libra Association\u00a0are led by people of color, women or people who identify as LGBT.\u00a0</p><p>\"Facebook's diversity failures include an abysmal record of hiring and promoting people of color and women, contracting with diverse suppliers and investing in a diverse asset managers,\" Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and chair of the House Financial Services Committee said at the conclusion of the hearing.\u00a0</p><p>             Zuckerberg's lack of preparation on diversity issues\u00a0was especially striking because lawmakers announced the hearing would be focused on discrimination in housing advertising. As my colleague Tony Romm noted, lawmakers handed Zuckerberg a beating on a broad range of issues outside of the hearing's topics - but it's fair to say\u00a0Facebook and Zuckerberg should have known these kinds of questions were coming.\u00a0</p><p>             The tech titan couldn't have picked a worse time to be caught off guard.             There's a growing rift between Facebook and civil rights groups over Zuckerberg's recent remarks on free speech. The groups say Facebook is abdicating its responsibility to protect people of color by\u00a0not subjecting political\u00a0posts to its community standards\u00a0in many cases or fact-check political\u00a0ads.</p><p>Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) raised those concerns during yesterday's hearing, saying\u00a0Facebook permits a \"lower standard for truthfulness and decency\" for politicians, saying: \"It is hate speech, it's hate, and it's leading to violence and death threats in my office.\"</p><p>Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group that has been critical of Facebook, said Zuckerberg's responses at yesterday's hearing showed he \"abdicated his responsibility.\"</p><p>\"Facebook needs to immediately end its policy allowing false ads and must enforce its community standards robustly and consistently before more people are put in harm's way,\" the group said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>             Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)\u00a0also pressed Zuckerberg on Facebook's fact-checking policy in a fiery exchange, pressing him to answer in simple yes or no form whether Facebook intended to allow false content to remain on its platform.          </p><p>\"Well Congresswoman, I think lying is bad and I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That's different from it being - from it - in our position the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you have lied,\" Zuckerberg said.\u00a0</p><p>             Lawmakers also pressed Zuckerberg on Facebook's handling of hate speech, which has long been a concern among civil rights leaders.\u00a0Tlaib asked Zuckerberg to explain whether a photo of a man holding a rifle outside a mosque is permitted on the social-networking site.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm not sure I'm in a position right now to evaluate any given post against all the different standards right now,\" Zuckerberg replied.\u00a0</p><p>Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) called Zuckerberg's response \"rather shocking\" when he pressed him on whether Facebook would allow a member of the American Nazi Party running for office to\u00a0purchase an ad that included hate speech otherwise prohibited.</p><p>\"Congressman, I think that depends on a bunch of specifics that I'm not familiar with this case and can't answer to,\" Zuckerberg said.</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>Comparing yesterday's hearing to Zuckerberg's 2018 appearance showed just how far Congress has come in learning about technology in the last year...or not. The New York Times's Kevin Roose:</p><p>The Verge's Casey Newton:</p><p>Others couldn't help but wonder what role the hearing would play in a sequel to \"The Social Network.\" Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-Va.) tried to get ahead of casting. Bloomberg's Kurt Wagner:</p><p>But maybe the problem was really just a generational divide. Journalist Irin Carmon:</p><p>             BITS: Zuckerberg doubled down on his defense of Facebook's plans to push into cryptocurrency as lawmakers from both parties expressed concerns about Libra.          </p><p>The CEO said that Libra wouldn't launch anywhere in the world without approval from U.S. regulators - but he did not specify which regulators and wouldn't commit to waiting for a green light from Congress. The remarks did little to reassure Democrats,\u00a0who tore into the tech titan.</p><p>\"Facebook's slogan for a long time was 'move fast, break things.' Mr.\u00a0Zuckerberg - we do not want to break the international monetary system,\" said Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.)\u00a0</p><p>\"When we have blurred the lines between banking and commerce, we've run into problems,\" said Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill.), who asked Zuckerberg whether the Securities and Exchange Commission should regulate Libra as a bank. \"Facebook has operated as a shadow government with you as its head.\"\u00a0</p><p>Zuckerberg dodged the question.</p><p>Republicans were more receptive to Facebook's plans, but had questions about why the Libra coalition was based in Switzerland.</p><p>\"There is a very competitive environment we have around the globe with enormous competition ... so I think it's important that we encourage responsible innovation here in the United States,\" said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.).</p><p>             NIBBLES: Facebook will launch a \"News\" tab on Friday curating stories from hundreds of organizations, some of which Facebook will pay for supplying content,people familiar with the plan tell my colleague Craig Timberg. The platform's shift back to news delivery comes as it endures federal and state antitrust scrutiny for its impact on the advertising industry.\u00a0Facebook's critics accuse the company of \"killing\" local news as advertisers shift away from newspapers and toward digital platforms.\u00a0</p><p>The list of participating news organizations, initially totaling about 200, will include The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and BuzzFeed News as well as local news outlets, people familiar with the project say. But critics say the change could disproportionately benefit already lucrative media companies. While some partners will receive payments of up to millions of dollars, others will be limited to generating revenue only when Facebook chooses to feature their stories.\u00a0</p><p>\"We've got to have this for the whole news ecosystem,\" said David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, representing nearly 2,000 U.S.-based news organizations. \"So while it's a start, and a good start, it's not a comprehensive solution.\"</p><p>The House antitrust subcommittee held a hearing this summer about Big Tech's impact on news as part of its broad probe of competition in Silicon Valley.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment on the service's launch date or participants, but Zuckerberg hinted at the announcement during a congressional hearing yesterday. The CEO will appear at an event in New York on Friday with the chief executive of the Wall Street Journal's parent company.</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon retailers continue to offer clothing from Bangladeshi factories that most major U.S. retailers stopped doing business with because of\u00a0safety standards,Justin Scheck, Jon Emont and Alexandra Berzon at the Wall Street Journal found. The questionable sourcing practices raise concerns over the company's oversight of its third-party sellers as it faces scrutiny from regulators in Washington.</p><p>The Journal found apparel on Amazon from factories flagged by safety-monitoring groups for safety problems including crumbling buildings, broken alarms, and missing sprinklers and fire barriers. Amazon lays out general sourcing requirements for suppliers and has conducted 150 audits of Bangladeshi suppliers in the past year, the company tells the Journal. But it doesn't explicitly monitor that third-party sellers, which sourced about two-thirds of the items identified by the Journal, comply with guidelines banning products that involve child or forced labor.</p><p>\"The standards require selling partners to consistently monitor and enforce those standards in their own operations and supply chain,\" Amazon told the Journal. Amazon has removed some listings flagged by the Journal and is in the process of reviewing others.</p><p>The Journal also found some items sourced from the factories in question on Walmart.com and one banned factory on Target's website, even though the companies have agreed to honor bans posed by two safety groups.\u00a0Many retailers stopped doing business with the factories after a 2013 factory collapse killed more than 1,100 people in Bangladesh, just as Amazon was launching its own clothing retail strategy. Walmart spokeswoman Marilee McInnis told the Journal the company was looking into the items for sale directly by Walmart; Target removed its listing after the Journal flagged it but declined to comment.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>-- The White House praised Google for a\u00a0breakthrough the company claims allows its quantum computing\u00a0processor to complete a task that would take a traditional supercomputer about 10,000 years in just 200 seconds.\u00a0 The breakthrough, which Google calls \"quantum supremacy,\" could revolutionize medicine, artificial intelligence and encryption one day,\u00a0my colleague\u00a0Sarah Kaplan reports.</p><p>The Trump administration has made a strong push for quantum research and private-public partnerships in order to compete with China.\u00a0</p><p> \"This critical milestone verifying quantum computational supremacy shows America's unparalleled innovation ecosystem at work,\" Michael Kratsios, Chief Technology Officer of the United States said in a statement. \"We will continue to embrace the strong public and private partnerships that produce incredible innovations and make America the world leader in technology,\"\u00a0</p><p>Kratsios points out that the Google team built on federally funded research and used resources from the Department of Energy and NASA to verify its results.

But posts continue to surface that violate them           -             underscoring how the companies are engaged in an infinite game of whack-a-mole that's tough to win.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          A page with more than 1,200 followers was peddling N95 masks on Facebook yesterday - despite the company's policies prohibiting such sales to prevent people from exploiting the public health emergency with scams or price gouging. Several accounts were also claiming to sell the masks on its subsidiary Instagram.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          A researcher even surfaced an instance of a sponsored post in his News Feed selling face masks and thermometers. These accounts were no longer available on Facebook and Instagram as of this morning, after The Technology 202 asked the company about them.\u00a0       </p><p>\"Since covid-19 was declared a public health emergency, Facebook has removed millions of ads and commerce listings for the sale of masks, hand sanitizer, surface disinfecting wipes and covid-19 test kits,\" Facebook spokesman Devon Kearns said. \"While enforcement is not perfect, we have put several automated detection mechanisms in place to block or remove this material from our platform.\"</p><p>YouTube and Twitter removed videos and and a post on their services last night for violating their policies about coronavirus content - after The Technology 202 asked whether they violated policies. YouTube removed 10 videos, mostly posted yesterday, that were peddling high-in-demand N95 medical masks. Twitter took down a tweet with more than 1,000 retweets that was touting claims that a controversial drug cured coronavirus - even though there's no proven treatment for the infection.\u00a0       </p><p>             The pandemic may be a turning point for Silicon Valley: Many of the big tech companies appear to be taking a tougher and more proactive stance against harmful coronavirus content than they policed against election meddling.\u00a0          </p><p>Twitter, for instance,           broadened its definition of public harm to address content that goes against authoritative health sources.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"We'll continue to review and require the removal of tweets that do not follow the Twitter rules,\"           spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said          . \"This is an evolving global conversation, and we're committed to remaining vigilant.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             But perfection may be elusive given the             massive scale of the tech platforms and the             deluge of hoaxes and swindlers             seizing on people's fears during the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0          </p><p>          \"We're seeing a surge in coronavirus misinformation on social\u00a0media as this pandemic\u00a0intensifies in the U.S.,\"\u00a0said Nir Hauser, the chief technology officer of the firm Vinesight, which alerted The Technology 202 to the tweet making unproven claims about a coronavirus cure. \"Coronavirus misinformation can have deadly consequences when it leads people to ignore life-saving instructions from authorities.\"       </p><p>          The Federal Trade Commission said yesterday that there has been a significant jump in coronavirus-related fraud. Since the beginning of the year, the FTC has received more than 7,800 coronavirus-related reports from consumers, double what they were about a week ago. However, the agency doesn't track how many of those reports are of scams that originated on social media. Many involve robocalls, texts and emails posing as government officials or businesses offering virus-testing kits. The agency reports these complaints have already cost Americans nearly $5 million.\u00a0       </p><p>             It doesn't help that the Silicon Valley titans are dealing with covid-related disruptions to their normal content moderation practices.\u00a0          </p><p>Facebook, for instance, put its army of content moderators on paid leave last month, and now it's relying more heavily on algorithms to flag coronavirus hoaxes and scams. The company says it's making coronavirus-related abuse a high priority, and it began automated enforcement on products like masks and hand sanitizer. The company expects its systems will improve over time.\u00a0</p><p>             Critics of the social media companies say the companies aren't prepared because they weren't attentive enough to fighting bad actors on their services in the past. They see many parallels to the tactics that coronavirus swindlers are using and drug dealers. For instance, the posts peddling masks often include a WhatsApp number to contact the seller - much like posts peddling other contraband such as steroids on the services.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"Our systems found these posts and video using the same logic and forensics used to expose sellers of opioids and steroids in 2018 and 2019,\" said Eric Feinberg, vice president of Coalition for a Safer Web and the founder of the research firm GIPEC, whose systems uncovered the Facebook and YouTube posts that the Technology 202 flagged to the companies. \"This is another example of the social media platforms' failure to keep pace with criminal actors who are taking advantage of the panic and fear of the coronavirus.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             Advocates for online safety say the technology companies won't make major changes until they're forced by regulators or lawmakers.\u00a0          </p><p>          \"The platforms are not going to change their business model until someone makes them do it. People have been hurt, swindled, humiliated ... and that's not enough to get them to do something different,\" said Tom Galvin, executive director of safety group Digital Citizens Alliance. \"The social media platforms have become a place where criminals can hide and consumers can be easily confused. We've been tracking these sites for seven years and it isn't getting better. It's getting worse.\"\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: A group of senators is calling on the Trump administration to provide more clarity to start-ups about their eligibility for small business loans created in the recent stimulus package. Many companies that raised venture capital funding             are concerned             that \"affiliation rules\" that predate the new program could make them ineligible.\u00a0          </p><p>          Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) co-signed the letter, which calls on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Small Business Administration chief Jovita Carranza to create a \"bright line test\" that would ensure certain small businesses with minority equity investors would be eligible for the loans.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"American start-ups, particularly in more capital-intensive areas such as life sciences, are instrumental in navigating both our nation's health response as well as our efforts to support telework and online education,\" they wrote. \"Clear guidelines from the SBA will ensure that innovative small businesses with minority equity investors -- particularly those that can provide critical assistance in our nation's response to this pandemic -- are eligible for the small business lending facility.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          The senators' letter adds to a frenzy of activity in Washington to ensure start-ups can get access to a slice of the nearly $350 billion in federal small business relief. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Ro Khanna, both California Democrats, sent a letter seeking more clarity on the rules yesterday. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) also led a group of House lawmakers in a similar letter, which asked for a waiver of the rules.       </p><p>             NIBBLES: Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wants to know what videoconferencing company Zoom is doing about a rise in reports of hackers hijacking private meetings to share hateful language and illicit images. The number of attacks, known as \"             Zoombombing,          \" have grown with the software's popularity during the coronavirus pandemic.       </p><p>          \"The millions of Americans now unexpectedly attending school, celebrating birthdays, seeking medical help, and sharing evening drinks with friends over Zoom during the Coronavirus pandemic should not have to add privacy and cybersecurity fears to their ever-growing list of worries,\" Blumenthal wrote in a letter to Zoom chief executive and Chairman Eric Yuan.</p><p>          The FBI issued a bulletin about the attacks yesterday, citing several instances where cybercriminals have dropped in on virtual classrooms to share pornographic or hateful content.\u00a0\u00a0       </p><p>Civil rights advocates\u00a0also voiced concerns. An online petition created by a member of the advocacy group Color of Change urging Zoom to address racist attacks has received\u00a0more than 20,000 signatures.</p><p>             \"Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously,\" Zoom Chief Marketing Officer Janine Pelosi said in a statement. \"We appreciate Senator Blumenthal's engagement on these issues and look forward to discussing with his office.\" \u00a0She condemned the behavior described in his letter.          </p><p>          But researchers say that's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to privacy concerns with the service. The company's encryption also may not be as strong as its marketing implies, Micah Lee and Yael Grauer report for the Intercept. Zoom also leaked the personal information of at least 1,000 users to other users that had the same personal email domain, Joseph Cox at Motherboard reported. The New York state attorney general is already probing the company's privacy and security protections.       </p><p>             BYTES: President Trump praised American Internet\u00a0and phone providers for keeping communications online \"under very strongly increased strain,\" at a news conference\u00a0yesterday. But he also took a dig at European telecommunications providers - without providing evidence that the American providers were faring much better.\u00a0          </p><p>\"If you look at Europe, they went a different route than we did and much different route we were talking about that just a little while ago and they are having tremendous problems,\" Trump said after speaking with leaders from Verizon, AT&amp;T, Comcast, T-Mobile, Charter, Liberty Media, LionTree and CenturyLink earlier in the day. \"But with business at a level that nobody has seen it before on the Internet, it is holding up incredibly well, and they expect that to continue no matter what.\"\u00a0</p><p>The European Union requested streaming services including Netflix, YouTube and Facebook to limit their streaming quality to help prevent Internet outages last week. But there have been no major outages in Europe, the telecommunications regulator for the European Union\u00a0reported yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>Federal Communications Commission chief Brendan Carr said data shows U.S. network performance is \"strong and resilient\" at an agency meeting yesterday, but the agency did not release specific numbers.</p><p>All of the firms Trump spoke with reached an agreement with the FCC earlier this month not to pull service from subscribers unable to pay their bills because of the coronavirus for the next 60 days.\u00a0Some have also made public WiFi hotspots available to more Americans during the crisis.</p><p>             - Washington yesterday became the first U.S. state to adopt a law\u00a0that prohibits government agencies from using facial recognition for broad and warrantless surveillance.\u00a0But privacy advocates who wanted an all-out ban say the legislation does not go far enough.\u00a0          </p><p>They say the law still leaves the door wide open for government abuse of the technology. American Civil Liberties Union of Washington's Jennifer Lee called the legislation \"insufficient.\"</p><p>\"We will continue to push for a moratorium to give historically targeted and marginalized communities, such as Black and Indigenous communities, an opportunity to decide not just how face surveillance technology should be used, but if it should be used at all,\" Lee said in a statement.</p><p>It's also a coup for local tech giant Microsoft.\u00a0The legislation was introduced by Washington state Sen. Joe Nguyen (D), a Microsoft employee, and the company\u00a0pushed for the regulation. Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has long called for greater regulation of facial recognition, praised the law\u00a0for introducing testing requirements to determine how accurate the software is before government agencies use it.</p><p>\"In our view, this approach is both necessary and pragmatic,\" Smith\u00a0wrote in a blog post. \"Washington's new law shows how regulation and market forces can move forward together in a way that advances innovation to meet public needs.\"</p><p>The law also requires government employees to be trained in the technology and calls for \"meaningful human review\" before the technology is used in decision-making.\u00a0</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News trending around the web:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-b285245f338a4f56bdd8902674979170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YJR-P7T1-DXKP-J1D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2190\"/><timeReceived>1:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

His bold proposals include limiting the government's use of facial recognition for surveillance without a warrant and requiring\u00a0unbiased,\u00a0third-party assessments\u00a0of the technology to determine whether it's\u00a0accurate or biased. He has been meeting with members of Congress\u00a0to talk about these ideas.\u00a0</p><p>             But getting the rest of Big Tech on board with a federal law will not be an easy task. Technology companies are chasing lucrative contracts--\u00a0especially from law enforcement, the military and\u00a0government agencies -- and these kinds of limits could potentially complicate those deals. Companies may also not want to deal with extra red tape as they refine the nascent technology.\u00a0</p><p>             So far, other companies have mostly remained\u00a0silent.\u00a0Amazon, a major provider of the technology, for instance, hasn't\u00a0publicly weighed in on where it stands on Microsoft's proposals. An Amazon representative\u00a0declined to comment\u00a0about whether it agrees it's time for facial recognition regulation. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>Microsoft's support for comprehensive regulation is a major break from how technology companies have previously dealt with Washington - often only coming to the table\u00a0under pressure of a major scandal.\u00a0Michael Posner, a business ethics professor at New York University, says in recent years there's been \"a\u00a0souring and a loss of trust writ large,\"\u00a0in the\u00a0American public's attitudes toward Big Tech.\u00a0\"This represents an effort to address that gap in trust and begin to demonstrate what technology companies need to do to be responsible public citizens.\"</p><p>             Here\u00a0are a few key things\u00a0Microsoft wants to see in a facial\u00a0recognition law:          </p><p>Microsoft's embrace of regulation threads the needle in Washington\u00a0at a time when Google, Facebook and Amazon are\u00a0facing\u00a0an unprecedented amount of scrutiny. As executives such as Google's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg are summoned in front of congressional committees - and Trump attacks\u00a0Amazon on Twitter - Microsoft has taken great pains in recent years to position itself as a collaborator with policymakers\u00a0on issues\u00a0from election security to privacy.\u00a0</p><p>             Even so, Smith\u00a0said Microsoft won't be exempt from\u00a0regulatory action taken against the technology industry at large.\u00a0\"When Congress acted in the 1930s to regulate the banks, they didn't create an exception for the banks they liked,\" he said.\u00a0\"There's a powerful incentive for everyone to focus on how we get the answers right on the future of technology and how it affects society here and around the world.\"</p><p>             To be sure, Microsoft also has a strong business incentive to ensure other companies buy into its principles.\u00a0As it\u00a0unilaterally\u00a0adopts more stringent principles for its use of facial recognition, it's a competitive risk. Smith tells me the company is losing deals because of its\u00a0tough stance on how its tech should be used. The company in recent months passed on a deal with law enforcement because it felt its facial recognition technology was not yet ready for way it was going to be used, he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"It would be used in a way where the risk of error would be too high,\" Smith said. Microsoft has also passed on deals where the technology would be used for domestic surveillance in other countries.\u00a0\"In that kind of situation, we just did not feel comfortable about the human rights dynamics involved.\"</p><p>Microsoft believes industry buy-in is needed to avoid a \"race to the bottom,\" but other companies who have not taken such a public stance may still be in the running for those contracts.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon works with law enforcement on facial recognition, and it has marketed its system to police departments as a way to identify criminals. It is\u00a0deployed\u00a0for officers' use in Oregon and Florida, my colleague Drew Harwell\u00a0reported earlier this year, and the company pitched its system to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials earlier this year. Amazon's technology has prompted a slew of backlash from privacy advocates -- and some lawmakers such as those in the\u00a0Congressional Black Caucus who fear the software could misidentify people of color and have \"profound negative unintended consequences... for African Americans, undocumented immigrants, and protesters.\" \u00a0</p><p>Amazon has defended the work it does with law enforcement. \"[M]achine learning is a very valuable tool to help law enforcement agencies, and while being concerned it's applied correctly, we should not throw away the oven because the temperature could be set wrong and burn the pizza,\" the company wrote in a blog post\u00a0this summer.</p><p>Microsoft came under fire over the summer as employees raised the concern that its own technology could be used by ICE per a cloud computing agreement the company has with the agency, Drew also reported. But the company later said it doesn't work with ICE on facial recognition. Microsoft took that stance as it first unveiled its push for facial recognition legislation this summer.\u00a0</p><p>             BITS: Tech executives took a step toward mending their\u00a0tense relationship with the Trump administration at a White House meeting yesterday,\u00a0where they discussed tightening collaboration with the government on artificial intelligence and addressed other issues such as 5G technology and quantum computing, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Douglas MacMillan. Ivanka Trump, President Trump's adviser and daughter, helped organize\u00a0the meeting and Trump himself\u00a0\"briefly joined\" the roundtable, MacMillan reported. The gathering included Google chief executive Sundar Pichai,\u00a0Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, IBM\u00a0chief executive\u00a0Ginni Rometty, Oracle chief executive\u00a0Safra Catz and Qualcomm chief executive\u00a0Steve Mollenkopf.</p><p>             Pichai, who is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee next week,\u00a0said in a statement that the discussion was\u00a0\"productive and engaging,\"\u00a0the Associated Press's Matt O'Brien\u00a0reported.\u00a0But executives from other top technology companies that have been in the political spotlight lately didn't make the guest list. MacMillan reported Apple, Amazon and Facebook weren't invited - despite their dominance in artificial intelligence.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: The release of a new\u00a0Apple Watch health app shows that\u00a0\"the revolution in medicine and wearable tech is not yet here,\"\u00a0The Washington Post's Christopher Rowland reported. That's because the new app, which aims to detect atrial fibrillation, is not intended for use for people who actually have that condition. \"The latest gadget worn on the wrist is simply not accurate enough to handle the task of assessing serious medical conditions, according to health officials,\" Christopher wrote. \"It's mostly a gateway for conversations with your doctor, and Apple's detailed setup screens for the new watch are loaded with warnings and explanations, including one that informs people with atrial fibrillation that the Apple Watch app is not for them.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, the Apple Watch does have the potential to help improve health care. \"There are possibilities for future advances, such as gathering electrical signals from the heart in real time, at the precise moment when a patient feels ill or a fluttering heart,\" my colleague wrote. Ben Scirica, a cardiovascular specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, noted:\u00a0 \"Storing that data and sending it to a doctor will lead to better options for patients and doctors.\"\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Lyft\u00a0said it confidentially filed\u00a0a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering - and in doing so\u00a0positioned\u00a0itself to beat\u00a0Uber             \u00a0in their race to\u00a0become the first publicly traded\u00a0ride-hailing company. Lyft, which is a significantly smaller company than its rival,\u00a0could go public in March or April while Uber aims to do so during the second half of 2019, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Maureen Farrell and Micah Maidenberg\u00a0reported.\u00a0They also noted that the \"IPO will be a test\" of the value that public investors place on ride-hailing companies.\u00a0\"Uber, Lyft and a host of other ride-hailing firms have received vast amounts of money from private investors at high valuations but still need a lot more capital as they continue to generate big losses.\"       </p><p>             There would be several advantages for Lyft in hitting the public market before Uber. \"If you're an institutional investor who is eager - after years of watching two meteoric privately held startups amass value - to get exposure to U.S. ride-hailing, there will be a few months during which you will have one option and one option only: Lyft,\"                  Recode's Theodore Schleifer\u00a0wrote. Additionally, it would also help Lyft build name recognition.\u00a0\"IPOs aren't as critical anymore for raising money (startups can do that easily thanks to venture capitalists),\" according to Schleifer. \"But they are critical moments for marketing - and Lyft now has that thunder.\"          </p><p>             - Uber\u00a0is getting ready to resume testing its driverless cars, but\u00a0on a smaller scale than the company did before it paused\u00a0its efforts following a\u00a0fatal crash in March.\u00a0\"Starting within a few weeks, it plans to run the vehicles on a mile loop between two company offices in Pittsburgh,\"the New York Times's\u00a0Daisuke Wakabayashi and Kate Conger reported. \"They won't operate at night or in wet weather, and they won't exceed 25 m.p.h., Uber said Wednesday.\"</p><p>Still, \"considerable issues\" remain with the company's autonomous vehicle technology, according to the Times. For instance,\u00a0Wakabayashi and Conger reported\u00a0that\u00a0\"as recently as a few weeks ago, the company's autonomous vehicle unit, Uber Advanced Technologies Group, or A.T.G., was still experiencing track testing 'failures' on different versions of its software, according internal company emails.\"</p><p>             - Facebook plans to extend its political ads transparency efforts to India as the country heads toward general elections in 2019.\u00a0\"Facebook said Thursday that it will also maintain an online searchable Ad Library, as it has in other markets, which will document all the ads related to politics from a particular advertiser alongside other information such as range of impressions, demographics that saw the ad, and the budget that went behind an individual ad,\" Manish Singh reported for VentureBeat. The move is a reminder that Facebook's election security problems aren't limited to the United States.\u00a0</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - U.S. tech investors have a message for France's president: Take it easy on taxes.\u00a0\"President Emmanuel Macron must pursue tax-friendly policies towards foreign investors if he wants French startups to flourish, visiting Silicon Valley investors told Reuters on Thursday,\" Reuters's Mathieu Rosemain\u00a0reported.

Microsoft? At least, it's a distinct possibility that the enterprise tech giant will soon be a social media superstar after Microsoft announced it was pursuing talks to buy TikTok's U.S. operations from Chinese parent company ByteDance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The whole saga has been layered in a thick film of politics since President Trump said last week he planned to ban the short-form video app from operating in the United States. Trump has insisted that TikTok is a national security concern and could be feeding Americans' data to the Chinese government. TikTok has adamantly denied that, but Trump persisted in his threats to find a way to either ban the app or force ByteDance to divest its ownership in the U.S. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Rachel Lerman, a breaking news tech reporter for The Washington Post in San Francisco. And Microsoft actually makes a lot of sense as an ideal company to buy TikTok when you think about it, partly because the big tech giant has so far escaped this round of accusations that big tech is getting just too big. But buying the popular video app could also open it up to a deluge of concerns that have barely touched it in the last two decades.</p><p>Microsoft may not have enough social media relevance to trigger anticompetitive investigations</p><p>The tech company is an entrenched leader in operating systems and cloud computing, but it does not yet have a leading social media platform that rivals Facebook or YouTube or TikTok. The closest Microsoft comes in that market is with its professional networking site LinkedIn, but experts say that is unlikely to put it in antitrust regulators' spotlight.</p><p>\"The fact is we don't have any actual case law that pursues mergers simply because the companies are big,\" said Herb Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \"They have to be competitors, for the most part, and have significant market share. \"</p><p>Microsoft has been spared as regulators and Congress dig into antitrust concerns with its fellow big tech companies Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><p>Microsoft is no stranger to antitrust investigations, but it's been about 20 years since it tangled with the U.S. government over its size and power.</p><p>That doesn't mean the company will be entirely in the clear.</p><p>Even if formal investigations don't pop up, it's unlikely Microsoft will entirely escape speculation that it is growing too powerful - it is, after all, one of the most valuable companies in the world. And TikTok is an increasingly popular social media app, with about 100 million users in the U.S. alone. </p><p>Regulators will likely consider a full picture of the deal, said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law &amp; Policy.</p><p>\"The question is not just whether Microsoft has other social networks it's combining, it's whether the combination of a social network and a cloud business and gaming business could be used anticompetitively,\" she said.</p><p>It also tosses Microsoft into the fray for dealing with future inquiries on content moderation and Section 230, the Internet liability shield law, she pointed out. </p><p>Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-RI), who has been helming the congressional antitrust investigation, told Pivot podcast hosts that Microsoft's argument is not a new one.</p><p>\"We hear it from monopolists all the time: We have to be big to compete with the other big company,\" he said.</p><p>The deal, if there is one, should be reviewed by antitrust enforcers on its merit, he said, and should not be subject to political pressure. </p><p>Microsoft is already starting to feel some pressure after messaging company Slack filed an antitrust complaint with European regulators, alleging Microsoft illegally tied its Teams messaging product in with its Office suite, forcing users to install it.</p><p>Facebook would likely trigger big antitrust concerns if it tried to buy TikTok. But it apparently doesn't need to make a bid for the company.</p><p>Facebook announced Wednesday it is launching TikTok competitor Instagram Reels in the U.S. The tab in Instagram's Explore page will include video shooting and editing tools and a scroll of videos that is highly reminiscent of TikTok's own app.</p><p>             Cat Zakrzewski is on vacation until Aug. 10. We'll be treating you this week to a slate of guest authors from The Post's stellar tech team. Enjoy.          </p><p>Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) will lead a letter to Facebook asking chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg to take concrete steps to enforce the company's policies against hate speech.</p><p>\"It's well past time for Facebook and all social media platforms to take both online violence against women and gendered disinformation campaigns seriously,\" Speier told The Post in a statement.\"This is no secret and there is no excuse.\"</p><p>In addition to asking Facebook to remove posts that threaten candidates with violence, or harass or dox them, the letter pushes the company to \"remove manipulated images or videos misrepresenting women public figures.\" Facebook declined to remove a manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) earlier this week.</p><p>\"Make no mistake, these tactics, which are used on your platform for malicious intent, are meant to silence women, and ultimately undermine our democracies,\" a draft of the letter shared with The Post states. The letter cites a recent study from the Wilson Center that found female candidates are more likely to be attacked by politically motivated trolls and bots online than male politicians.</p><p>So far more than three dozen members of Congress and global leaders have signed the letter.</p><p>Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-Calif.) also called for Facebook to remove the Pelosi video in a separate letter. \"The video is disinformation, and by leaving it up, Facebook is actively playing a role in disseminating political disinformation,\" Eshoo wrote.</p><p>Microsoft, which is known for its operating system and suite of enterprise products, may have seemed like an unlikely pick to buy the teen-friendly social media app, Jay Greene reports. But TikTok offers something Microsoft needs: billions of videos.</p><p>Right now the tech giant lacks a video service, putting it at a disadvantage to its Big Tech rivals such as Amazon and Google. </p><p>\"If AI is the new electricity, the fuel that powers these plants is data,\" Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle research firm started by late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, told Jay.</p><p>Data harvested from TikTok videos could be used for anything from helping brands develop more alluring advertisements or even teaching AI how to read lips, experts tell Jay.</p><p>             The legislation, introduced by Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)              follows a recent Reuters report              that Rite Aid used facial recognition technology in hundreds of its U.S. stores for nearly a decade without explicit consumer awareness.          </p><p>             The legislation would require private companies and corporations to get written consent from consumers before collecting their biometric data. Failure to do so could open the door for state or consumer lawsuits. Facial recognition technology used by private companies is largely unregulated in the United States. Only three states, including Illinois, have biometric privacy laws on the books.          </p><p>             But the misuse of the technology, which government studies show is less accurate in matching non-White faces, has sparked growing calls from advocates and lawmakers for a halt in the use of the technology.          </p><p>             Privacy advocates praised the legislation.          </p><p>             \"The rapid spread of commercial facial recognition poses just as much of a threat to basic human liberty and fairness as government and law enforcement use,\" said Fight for The Future Deputy Director Evan Greer in a statement. \"We believe most private and corporate uses of facial recognition should be banned entirely, but this new legislation will play an important role in slowing down the unfettered creep of this technology into our daily lives.\"</p><p>The company, Mobilewalla, released a report in June that showed the demographics of protesters based on their location data, as BuzzFeed News first reported. \"We have serious concerns that your company's data could be used for surveillance of Americans engaging in Constitutionally-protected speech.\" Warren and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.), and House Committee on Oversight and Reform Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) wrote to the company's CEO yesterday.</p><p>They suggested that sharing the cellphone data with any government agencies may have allowed police to evade a Supreme Court ruling that requires police to obtain a warrant for cellphone data first.</p><p>The E.U.'s antitrust watchdog is concerned the acquisition could give Google even more market power in the online advertising business, CNN reports.

Sign up to get The Technology 202 in your inbox.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             A broad coalition of more than 200 retailers, banks and technology companies is releasing new recommendations for national privacy legislation today in a clear push to get out in front of lawmakers promising to rein in their data collection practices in the next Congress.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Business Roundtable's consumer privacy legislation framework, provided exclusively to The Technology 202, calls on the United States to adopt a national privacy law that would apply the same data collection requirements to all companies regardless of sector -- while ramping up\u00a0Federal Trade Commission\u00a0staffing and funding to enforce the rule. It calls on companies to give consumers more control of their data and form a national standard for breach notification.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We see a real need to both protect consumers at a time when digital services and the digital economy is so important and expanding, and at the same time, making sure we're advancing global competitiveness,\"\u00a0Julie Sweet, chief executive of Accenture North America, who chairs the Business Roundtable's technology committee, tells me.\u00a0</p><p>Members of the Business Roundtable include chief executives from companies such as Apple, Walmart and Wells Fargo. And some of its top executives such as J.P. Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and AT&amp;T chief executive Randall L. Stephenson will meet with policymakers including Ivanka Trump and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) at a CEO Innovation Summit in Washington later today.\u00a0</p><p>             The fact that such a wide cross-section of companies -- far beyond the technology campuses of Silicon Valley - are actively seeking ways to change the collection and storage of data online reflects a sea change for the privacy debate in the United States. Companies such as Salesforce or Verizon, for instance, may not be in the eye of the political storm in Washington recently in the way that, say, Facebook has - but they also have skin in the private debate.</p><p>After all, every company is a technology company; it's not just popular social networks or search engines that will be subject to national privacy legislation but any company that handles personal information online.\u00a0As the Marriott data breach highlighted just last week, companies that are rarely associated with the technology industry\u00a0hold tremendous amounts of data about individuals -- and they may not be doing enough to protect it.\u00a0</p><p>             All this puts even more pressure on policymakers --             especially Democrats who have pledged to get tough on Big Tech as they take over the House. They will need to craft a bill that fulfills their promise to crack down on tech companies' highly publicized misuse of their customers' data\u00a0but that also does not impede businesses big and small, in every sector from retail to media.</p><p>The Business Roundtable's framework is relatively broad -- and that reflects the challenge. Its recommendations to lawmakers include:\u00a0</p><p>What's more, Business Roundtable does not include some of the highest profile technology companies that have recently been under fire for their mishandling of user data. For instance, Google, Facebook and Amazon are not members. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)\u00a0</p><p>             It's a big tech day\u00a0in Washington, and it remains to be seen whether privacy will be top of mind. Technology executives, including some\u00a0who are also part of the Business Roundtable\u00a0such as\u00a0Oracle chief executive Safra Catz, are expected at a separate White House lunch on innovation with the Trump administration\u00a0-- in what's appears to be easing an easing of tensions after President\u00a0Trump's clashes with Silicon Valley on issues ranging from anti-conservative bias to antitrust issues. (IBM, whose chief executive is also attending, tells me for instance its priorities for that meeting include artificial intelligence and quantum computing.)</p><p>Whether or not it comes up at the White House today, the devil will be in the details as lawmakers try to craft a privacy bill before 2020, when a law in California is slated to go into effect.\u00a0</p><p>Already, Democrats are saying they will not support a national bill that is weaker than protections consumers\u00a0have in local jurisdictions. And as my colleague Aaron Gregg reported, some\u00a0Democrats in the wake of the Marriott breach want the U.S. to adopt fines that are similar to the EU's\u00a0\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation ,\u00a0which contains fines\u00a0up to 4 percent of a company's global revenue if it fails to comply with its requirements.</p><p>Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU,\u00a0said any company that handles personal information is going to have to tighten its ship if a national law passes. But some companies will feel the burden of a national privacy law more than others, whether or not they're considered a technology company, given the way many operate in today's digital economy.</p><p>\"If you're in the business of profiting off of shady intrusions on people's privacy, then I think you need to worry,\" Stanley said. \"There is a reckoning that's taking place right now.\"</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0 A trove of documents released by a British lawmaker yesterday could fuel other investigations of Facebook from lawmakers\u00a0around the world. The documents offered a rare glimpse into\u00a0the inner workings of\u00a0 the company, revealing\u00a0 how company executives internally discussed issues ranging from privacy to competitors' access to data.\u00a0</p><p>             Here's the top issue to watch: \"The internal communications, some of them from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, appear to show Facebook trading access to user data in exchange for advertising buys and other concessions, which would contradict Facebook's long-standing claim that it doesn't sell people's information,\"\u00a0The Washington Post's Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Tony Romm\u00a0reported.\u00a0 Emails dated from October 2012\u00a0show that chief executive\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0was considering\u00a0 ways to monetize this resource.\u00a0\"Without limiting distribution or access to friends who use this app, I don't think we have any way to get developers to pay us at all besides offering payments and ad networks,\" Zuckerberg said\u00a0in one of the emails released yesterday.</p><p>Facebook quickly went on the defensive, with Zuckerberg\u00a0posting on his personal Facebook page that the documents were just part of discussions. \"We've never sold anyone's data,\" he wrote. Yet\u00a0Damian Collins, who is leading the parliamentary investigation into Facebook, said the social giant had\u00a0\"whitelisting agreements with certain companies\" to access user data after the social network restricted such access in 2014 and 2015.</p><p>             NIBBLES: There is no indication that Zuckerberg\u00a0will relinquish his position as chairman of Facebook's board of directors despite the latest scandal. As CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez noted,\u00a0\"there is almost nothing\" the board could do to remove him even if it tried. Zuckerberg\u00a0is the majority vote holder and could show the door to any director seeking to push him out, according to CNBC.\u00a0\"If Zuckerberg wants to stay chairman then Zuckerberg is going to stay chairman,\" Stuart Grant, co-founder and managing director of\u00a0Bench Walk Advisors who previously sued Facebook, told Rodriguez.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg received the backing of the company's board in\u00a0another scandal. The board defended Sandberg's decision to inquire whether philanthropist George Soros shorted Facebook's stock as\u00a0\"entirely appropriate,\" the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Deepa Seetharaman reported. Nevertheless, the accumulation of controversies is taking a toll on Facebook's workforce.\u00a0\"Current and former employees describe a tense and, at times, hostile atmosphere inside the company, one in which both senior employees and even staunch loyalists are contemplating their futures,\" BuzzFeed\u00a0News's\u00a0Charlie Warzel and\u00a0Ryan Mac wrote.</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0The documents indicate that Facebook users and developers were kept in the dark about the company's data collection practices.\u00a0\"Company product managers discussed testing new features to collect call logs on Android smartphones in a way that might have made it harder for users to understand what they were giving away. They debated collecting call log data from users in ways that would bypass the privacy permissions people normally check off when signing up for an app,\" Craig, Tony and Lizza also reported.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook even realized that it could result in backlash against the company, at one point discussing how the media might portray it. \"This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it,\" the email read.</p><p>             In addition to privacy concerns, the documents called attention to the company's hard-nosed tactics in dealing with competitors, particularly the Vine video app owned by Facebook rival Twitter.\u00a0A Facebook manager suggested the company immediately cut off the app's access to data, according to the documents. \"Yup, go for it,\" Zuckerberg replied in one of the emails.</p><p>Rus Yusupov, co-founder of Vine, recalled the episode on Twitter:</p><p>             -- The release of the Facebook documents prompted a flurry of reactions on Twitter:          </p><p>Collins, the British lawmaker who released the documents, explained his decision on Twitter.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said the FTC \"must act decisively &amp; vigorously\" following the release of the Facebook documents.</p><p>The Post's Geoffrey A. Fowler noted that the release of documents challenges Facebook's defense that it does not sell user data.</p><p>Bloomberg News's Sarah Frier said the emails also show \"how ruthless\" the social network is with its competitors.</p><p>The revelations could raise legal issues for Facebook, according to Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu.</p><p>Motherboard's Joseph Cox argued that Facebook \"knew full well what it was doing around highly controversial decisions, knew what the blow back would be, and did it anyway.\"</p><p>And Cher also weighed in.</p><p>             -- The White House is hosting tech executives and academics for a discussion about innovation. The guests, per my colleague Tony Romm, include Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google, Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft, Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM, Safra Catz, chief executive of Oracle, Steven Mollenkopf, chief executive of Qualcomm and Steve Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group. On the academic side, Farnam Jahanian, president of Carnegie Mellon University and Rafael Reif, president of MIT, will also attend the event.</p><p>             \u00a0- Google maintains an advertising service for small local businesses in China that doesn't generate significant revenue but helps the U.S. company remain on good terms with Chinese authorities, according to the Information's Wayne Ma. Google helps smaller businesses place ads abroad through its Google Export Experience Centers - a service that Chinese companies cannot provide under the country's censorship rules - but also receives some perks from public officials, the Information reported.</p><p>             \"The officials shower the centers with incentives like free rent, according to government statements and people familiar with the deals, and promote them through elaborate ribbon-cutting ceremonies,\" Ma wrote. \"The centers help Google build political goodwill by aligning with China's economic goals to boost exports from small businesses.\"          </p><p>             -\u00a0Tensions already running high between Washington and Beijing just went up a notch after Canadian officials said a top executive from Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies faces extradition to the United States. \"Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive who is also the daughter of the tech giant's founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1, according to Canada's Department of Justice,\" The Post's Emily Rauhala and Ellen Nakashima reported.</p><p>             - Encryption-cracking quantum computing is coming - though not right away. \"Quantum computers with the ability to crack today's encrypted systems are at least 10 years away from development, according to a report compiled by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,\" Nextgov's Frank Konkel reported. \"However, the report - released Tuesday - makes clear that quantum computers pose a dramatic threat to the encryption that secures today's networks and computer systems and calls for the development of cryptography immune to quantum computers as fast as possible.\"</p><p>             - Waymo is starting the United States's first commercial driverless service in Arizona,\u00a0marking a major break in the expansion of autonomous vehicles.\u00a0\"It's a big leap between testing this stuff and booking and transporting a passenger who's paying money for a service,\"\u00a0Costa Samaras, an automation expert at Carnegie Mellon University, told my colleague\u00a0Michael Laris. \"This is real.\"</p><p>Waymo One, as the service is called, is launching in Chandler and other communities near Phoenix.\u00a0\"Waymo, part of Alphabet Inc., is starting small, rolling out the service first to hundreds of the company's local volunteer testers, and only in part of this sprawling region of almost 5 million people,\" Michael reported. But expanding driverless vehicles will require winning over the public.\u00a0\"There is significant public skepticism about self-driving cars, and polls find most people don't want to ride in them,\" according to my colleague.</p><p>             - A majority of New Yorkers support Amazon's plan for their city but are having mixed reactions about the incentives that the company is receiving.             \"Fifty-seven percent of New York City residents who responded to the poll approved of Amazon building one of two secondary headquarters in the Long Island City area of Queens, more than double the 26 percent who said they oppose the move, according to a Quinnipiac University poll,\" Reuters reported. \"Respondents were divided on the $2.8 billion in tax breaks and incentives offered to attract Amazon, with 46 percent supporting them versus 44 percent who oppose the package, the poll found.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - More news generating buzz on the Web:          </p><p>             Today          </p><p>Man arrested after Cheesecake Factory promotion chaos:</p><p>George W.

And it served as a reminder that,\u00a0in the three years since the Russian plot to influence the 2016 election, Congress hasn't passed any legislation to address it.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Democrats are seizing the moment to pressure their Republican colleagues to address election interference before there's a repeat in 2020.\u00a0They're accusing the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) of blocking bipartisan legislation from moving forward.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee:\u00a0</p><p>             One bill that has been languishing in Congress is the Honest Ads Act, of which Warner is a co-sponsor. The bill would regulate digital campaign ads on platforms like Facebook and Google, requiring the companies to maintain public databases of political ads purchased on their platforms, as well as to take reasonable steps to prevent foreign actors from purchasing ads on the platform.</p><p>Ads on platforms such as\u00a0Facebook were one of the key ways that Russian actors sought to amplify disinformation and sow discord ahead of the 2016 election. McConnell has previously expressed skepticism about mandatory disclosures for ads on social media platforms.\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), another co-sponsor of the bill, said at a Post Live event earlier this week that Congress should be \"putting in place rules of the road on the propaganda, especially paid ads.\" She said the companies should have to reveal those ads \"and not just voluntarily in all their crazy ways; in a set way.\" She also slammed Republican leaders for blocking that bill, which was initially co-sponsored by the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and is now backed by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\u00a0</p><p>\"They've stopped the Honest Ads Act, which requires this public airing of what these ads are, just like The Washington Post or ABC or CNN would have to explain what the ads are and who's paying for them,\" Klobuchar said. \"Not true of our friends in the social media.\"</p><p>             Expect them to use Mueller's words to make their case for urgency.\u00a0Mueller said\u00a0Wednesday that the Russian interference efforts in 2016 were not \"a single attempt.\" He warned the Russian actors plan to do it during the next campaign, and that other countries might follow suit.\u00a0\"Many more countries are developing capability to replicate what the Russians had done,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>My colleagues Craig Timberg and Tony Romm also write this week that disinformation experts have spotted Twitter operations linked to Iran mimicking some of the techniques Russia used to sway the 2016 election. Twitter has already removed 7,000 phony accounts from Iran this year alone. Iran is far from the only country with these capabilities, and researchers expect this election season American voters will be targeted with more foreign disinformation than ever before.\u00a0</p><p>             Without any momentum for legislation,\u00a0the companies are making their own way -- with mixed results.\u00a0Facebook and other major social media companies have said that, in the absence of legislation, they're proactively building measures to make it possible for the public to track political ads on their websites. But\u00a0 the New York Times published an investigation\u00a0yesterday that found that the online\u00a0library Facebook built to track these political ads is falling short of the social network's promises.\u00a0</p><p>\"While ordinary users can look up individual ads without a problem, access to the library's data is so plagued by bugs and technical constraints that it is effectively useless as a way to comprehensively track political advertising, according to independent researchers and two previously unreported studies on the archive's reliability, one by the French government and the other by researchers at Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser,\" the Times's Matthew Rosenberg wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook isn't the only company whose ad transparency tools are coming under scrutiny. Both the French government and Mozilla researchers found that Google's ad tool was functioning better than Facebook's, but it included only political ads and not issue ads -- which were one of the main tools by Russians in 2016. The French researchers also found that Twitter's advertising center did not offer a comprehensive accounting of all the political ads on the platform.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS:\u00a0Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has been a key tool in a quest by academics and lawmakers to break up the tech giant, my colleagues Elizabeth Dwoskin and Tony Romm report. In recent weeks Hughes has made the rounds with regulators at the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and state regulators, and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, bringing with him an expanded 39-slide presentation laying out a point he made in a New York Times op-ed earlier this summer: Facebook needs to be broken up.</p><p>\"I hope that my speaking out provides cover to a lot of other folks, whether former employees or current ones, to express ambivalence or concern about what's going on,\" Hughes told Elizabeth and Tony in an interview. \"And I think there's a lot to be concerned about.\"</p><p>The presentation is guided by a case long made by academics: Facebook has moved into monopoly territory by systematically acquiring rivals such as Instagram and WhatsApp.\u00a0While Hughes cashed out of Facebook over a decade ago, he \"can frame the business practices of present-day Silicon Valley in ways that jibe with largely untested antitrust laws that were written for major oil and rail companies decades ago,\" an advantage that could be crucial to an antitrust case Facebook says the FTC has launched. (Hughes might also be providing names of potential sources for investigators, Steve Lohr at the New York Times reported.)</p><p>             NIBBLES: The campaign for 2020 contender Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is suing Google for $50 million after the platform suspended her campaign from advertising for six hours after the first Democratic debate in June. Gabbard is also claiming Google has been sending her campaign's emails to spam at a higher rate than other Democratic candidates - treatment she claims amounts to political censorship, the New York Times's Daisuke Wakabayashi reports.</p><p>\"Google's discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values,\" Gabbard told the Times. Google said the campaign's account was suspended because changes in account behavior flagged an automated fraud detection program.</p><p>Gabbard, like other 2020 candidates including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has called for the breakup of Big Tech. But her new claims more closely aligns with increasing alarm from conservatives about the unchecked power these platforms have to influence what content users see.</p><p>Tech experts have slammed the suit for echoing unfounded claims by prominent conservatives that big tech companies discriminate against their content - even going as far as to cite the claims in the filings, as NBC News's Ben Collins pointed out.</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0             The Justice Department is poised to end its silence on the T-Mobile and Sprint merger and\u00a0scheduled an 11 a.m. ET press conference today, with antitrust chief Makan Delrahim set to \"announce a significant merger enforcement action,\" Ina Fried reports in Axios.\u00a0The press conference comes after the Justice Department delayed a\u00a0decision on a $26 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint while it lobbied states opposed to the merger for support,Drew FitzGerald at the Wall Street Journal reports.</p><p>A group of 14 Democratic state attorneys general filed an antitrust suit in June to preemptively block the merger, claiming it would drive up prices for consumers. To clear resistance, the Justice Department worked with T-Mobile and Sprint on a deal that would allow Dish to pay $1.4 billion for Sprint assets and create a competitor to allay antitrust concerns. It was expected that the agency would settle with the companies this week and approve the merger. But now the DOJ is attempting to get state attorneys general onboard with the settlement before moving forward, Drew reports.</p><p>The merger, first announced in April 2018, received approval from the Federal Communications Commission in May.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>My colleague Peter Holley writes about a company that claims to offer a safer way to make robotic deliveries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f5de060915e140228af4f7b7552ea0ef</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNF-04T1-DXKP-J4GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1489\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I think wittingly, because right now they are putting up something that they know is false. I think it's wrong,\" she told KQED News,\u00a0in her first public comments about the company's decision to not remove a video doctored to make her appear drunk. \"They're lying to the public. . . . I think they have proven - by not taking down something they know is false - that they were willing enablers of the Russian interference in our election.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The clash             \u00a0could mark an inflection point in the international debate about how to handle disinformation:\u00a0It sends a message that Facebook does not see a responsibility to remove false information from spreading about people online -- even if they're third in line for the U.S. presidency.\u00a0That's hitting close to home for policymakers around the world -- who might now take even stronger action to regulate the company's handling of disinformation.          </p><p>             Already, international lawmakers signaled\u00a0a tougher line after Facebook's announcement that it would not take down the video.\u00a0British Member of Parliament Damian Collins pressed Facebook executive Neil Potts\u00a0on its decision to leave the Pelosi video up at a hearing in Canada on Tuesday, where an international committee of lawmakers from countries including the United Kingdom, Canada and Singapore convened to establish international standards to combat disinformation.</p><p> \"The issue here is if someone is making a film or slowing down a film or manipulating a film to create the impression that a senior public official is not fit for office, then that is an attempt to undermine them and the office that they hold,\" Collins said. He added leaving a video up that is clearly fake\u00a0\"is irresponsible.\"\u00a0</p><p> \"My concern here is that this creates a very dangerous precedent,\" Collins added.</p><p>Facebook says the video, which has attracted more than 2.8 million views, does not violate its\u00a0policies, which do not stipulate the information people post on Facebook must be true.\u00a0It declined to comment on Pelosi's remarks. The company told my colleague Drew Harwell it would \"heavily reduce\" the video's appearances in people's news feeds, append a small info\u00a0box alongside the video linking to fact-check sites, and open a pop-up box linking to \"additional reporting\" whenever someone clicks to share the video.</p><p>             But lawmakers say that's not enough -- and that the precedent could have implications for many public figures down the line. They're worried about the impact that disinformation could have on the public's trust in public officials after seeing disinformation campaigns play out ahead of elections around the world.\u00a0</p><p>             The politicians wanted to know if Facebook would take the same position if the company's credibility was on the line.\u00a0 \"Let's say that a similar video appeared, but only\u00a0the person there was [Facebook chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg, would that video be taken down?\"\u00a0Keit Pentus-Rosimannus, a lawmaker from Estonia asked Potts at the hearing in Canada earlier this week.\u00a0Potts said the videos would be given equal treatment.</p><p>But Pelosi also questioned that.\u00a0\"For me, I'm in the arena, I've been the target all along,\" Pelosi said in the same radio interview. \"I wonder what they would do if\u00a0 Mark Zuckerberg wasn't portrayed, you know, slowed down, made to look\" drunk, she said. If it was \"one of their own, would this be - is this their policy? Or is it just a woman?\"</p><p>             Lawmakers around the world are also concerned that the problem is only going to get worse -- especially as video manipulation technology becomes more sophisticated.\u00a0 \"We're all aware that technology is going to make the creation of these kinds of fake films or manipulated films much easier,\" Collins said at the hearing in Ottawa on Tuesday.\u00a0</p><p>Pentus-Rosimannus also pressed Facebook on whether it would remove \"deep fake\" videos -- videos doctored with artificial intelligence that can make it appear people said or did things that never happened.\u00a0</p><p>Potts said the company would identify the videos as being fake and inform its users. He said the company is currently working with researcherss to understand the threat of this emerging technology.\u00a0</p><p> \"We constantly iterate those policies, and we may update those policies as these issues evolve,\" Potts said.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Salesforce has a message for gun-selling retailers: Stop selling military-style rifles, or stop using our software, The Washington Post's Jay Greene reports.</p><p>\"The pressure Salesforce is exerting on those retailers - barring them from using its technology to market products, manage customer service operations and fulfill orders - puts them in a difficult position,\" Jay writes. \"Camping World, for example, spends more than $1 million a year on Salesforce's e-commerce software, according to one analyst estimate. Switching to another provider now could cost the company double that to migrate data, reconfigure systems and retrain employees.\"</p><p>The enterprise company's change in its acceptable use policy highlights how a company that many consumers aren't familiar with is playing a key role in shaping the dynamics of a charged social issue.</p><p>The move did not go over well with some industry advocates, who told Jay these types of rules are \"corporate-policy virtue signaling\" and discriminate against gun owners.\"It is a very chilling effect when a company as large as Salesforce puts out a policy like this,\" said Mark Oliva, public affairs director of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group. \"A policy like this is not surprising from a company based in that part of the country.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Twitter is researching how white nationalists and supremacists use the platform as it tries to determine if they should be banned from the platform outright or should be allowed to stay on the platform so others can counter their views,\u00a0Vice's Jason Koebler and Joseph Cox report.\u00a0</p><p>Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's head of trust and safety, legal and public policy, told Vice that Twitter believes \"counter-speech and conversation are a force for good, and they can act as a basis for de-radicalization, and we've seen that happen on other platforms, anecdotally.\"</p><p> \"So one of the things we're working with academics on is some research here to confirm that this is the case,\" she added.</p><p>Gadde joined Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey earlier this year when he met with President Trump to discuss \"the health of public conversation\" on Twitter last month. Twitter is working with external researchers on the work, but the company declined to name them to Vice, adding they're under non-disclosure agreements.\u00a0</p><p> \"We're working with them specifically on white nationalism and white supremacy and radicalization online and understanding the drivers of those things; what role can a platform like Twitter play in either making that worse or making that better?\" Gadde said.</p><p>Josh Constine, of TechCrunch, said he's tired of the company \"thinking\" about making changes:</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0Special Counsel Robert Mueller III closed his one and only press conference Wednesday by restating a central conclusion of his office's investigation: \"That there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election,\"\u00a0an allegation that he said \"deserves the attention of every American,\" my colleague Joseph Marks writes today in the Cybersecurity 202.\u00a0</p><p>Democrats in Congress were quick to oblige with a fresh push for election security bills - and attacks on Republicans who are blocking them.</p><p>\"Mr.\u00a0Mueller\u00a0made clear today that the Russians interfered in our elections, the wellspring of our democracy.. and yet, inexplicably, Senator McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate are blocking bipartisan election security legislation,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) said in a statement.</p><p>             As election security ramps up on the Hill, it could put social media companies like Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter back in Washington's glare. In the press conference and more extensively in his report, Mueller put a spotlight on how these services can be exploited by foreign actors to interfere in an election.\u00a0          </p><p>Mueller said\u00a0\"...a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election,\" in yesterday's conference.\u00a0</p><p>As the special counsel's work concludes, some commentators think it's time the federal government -- not just the tech companies -- do more to avoid a repeat of the Russian interference that happened in 2016. CNBC's Kate Fazzini writes it's time to move past the Mueller report in Congress, and \"Facebook can't save us.\"\u00a0</p><p> \"I'm\u00a0not a Facebook apologist,\" she wrote.\u00a0\"But we shouldn't be leaning on social media companies to protect our elections. We should be relying on the federal government.\"</p><p>             -- Apple is publicly defending its App Store with a new website as it faces both an antitrust lawsuit from consumers and a formal European Union investigation over the store's tactics. But The Verge's Chris Welch notes\u00a0the website also brings attention to how hard it can be to compete with Apple.\u00a0          </p><p>\"Today, the App Store is more vibrant and innovative than ever, offering equal opportunities to developers to deliver their apps and services across iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch,\" reads\u00a0a new page at Apple's website titled \"App Store - Principles and Practices.\" \"We're proud of the store we've built and the way we've built it.\"</p><p>In one section, Apple goes over its core apps, such as Maps, and identifies third-party competitors in the App Store, like Google Maps and Waze.\u00a0</p><p> \"The company fails to mention that none of these apps can be chosen as the default messaging app, maps service, email client, web browser, or music player,\" Chris writes.\u00a0\"That limitation isn't always a deal-breaker - just ask WhatsApp, which is more popular than iMessage in many countries - but it still gives Apple's services an advantage.\"</p><p>Apple also highlighted a category of apps like Netflix and Spotify, which no longer allow their customers to make in-app subscription purchases on Apple operating systems because Apple takes a cut of the sale.\u00a0</p><p> \"But here, again, Apple ignores a major gripe that developers have been raising for years: if an app doesn't use Apple's in-app purchase system, its developers are forbidden from telling their customers where and how they can pay outside of the App Store or providing a convenient link.\"</p><p>             -- Tech news from the private sector:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Tech news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -- Elizabeth Warren's campaign has a new billboard in San Francisco calling for a break up of Big Tech. Until Wednesday, the sign will be up at 4th and Townsend near the Caltrain station --\u00a0a prime spot for ads for technology startups that have recently raised venture capital funding.\u00a0          </p><p>             \"Today's big tech companies have too much power,\" a Warren aide said in a statement.\"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation. Elizabeth's plan would help ensure\u00a0tech giants do not crowd out potential competitors, smother the next generation of great tech companies, and wield so much power that they can undermine our democracy.\"\u00a0</p><p>On Twitter, tech observers reacted to the stunt, calling it everything from trolling to \"brilliant.\"\u00a0</p><p>From my colleague Tony Romm:\u00a0</p><p>From Can Duruk, who writes the newsleter The Margins and previously worked as a software engineer at Uber:</p><p>From Luther Lowe, senior vice president of public policy at Yelp, who has advocated for antitrust action against Google:\u00a0</p><p>Nicholas Bauer noted the startup community's acceptance of the plan likely hinged on whether they wanted to compete with Facebook or be acquired by the social network:\u00a0</p><p>             -- Tech news generating buzz online:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f053a5a3e1d24af88f3c03f8b96f8eae</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W78-MSN1-DXKP-J1B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2133\"/><timeReceived>12:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 30, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Knight Foundation underscores how public opinion is shifting about Silicon Valley. Growing concerns that misinformation and other issues on social media are tempering the optimism many Americans once had about the industry.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          Here some of the survey's key findings:       </p><p>-              Americans think Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power: 77 percent of respondents share this sentiment, across all demographic and political groups. But they're split on what to do about it: 50 percent favor breaking the companies up, while 49 percent oppose government intervention.\u00a0       </p><p>-              Their top concern is misinformation spreading online: 74 percent of Americans are very concerned about the spread of misinformation on the Internet. There's a partisan gap: majorities of both Democrats (84 percent) and Republicans (65 percent) are very concerned about this issue, but Democrats are more concerned about the issue.       </p><p>-             Americans don't have faith social media companies can fix the problem: They don't trust social media companies much (44 percent) or at all (40 percent) to make the right decisions about what content should or should not be allowed on online platforms.</p><p>- But Americans don't think government is up to the task either: 59 percent of Americans believe elected officials and political candidates are paying \"too little\" attention to issues dealing with technology and technology companies. They would still prefer the companies (55 percent) to make those decisions about what content should be allowed online rather than the government (44 percent).\u00a0</p><p>             The polling helps explain why proposals to regulate Big Tech have become a popular talking point among politicians on both sides of the aisle. But it also illustrates why it's been so difficult for lawmakers to actually pass meaningful privacy, antitrust or election transparency legislation. There's broad consensus there's a problem, but little agreement about how to solve it.\u00a0          </p><p>\"The techlash is real,\" said Sam Gill, senior vice president and chief program officer at Knight Foundation. \"People are concerned about major tech companies and their effects on democracy. But they are deeply divided on what should be done.\"</p><p>That creates a challenge for those seeking to campaign on tech issues as November approaches. Already misinformation on tech platforms and their responses to it is emerging as a key issue on the campaign trail. Former vice president Joe Biden, for instance, who just scored a key victory in Michigan and several other states, has been very critical about Facebook's handling of falsehoods on its service.\u00a0</p><p>Earlier this week, the campaign criticized the company for not immediately flagging a deceptively edited video shared by White House social media director Dan Scavino. Twitter labeled the video as \"manipulated media\" hours before Facebook did.\u00a0</p><p>\"Facebook's malefesance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information is a national crisis in this respect,\" Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said. \"It is also an unconscionable act of putting profit above not just our country, but every country.\"</p><p>But expect Republicans to continue to seize on these issues as well. While less concerned about misinformation, the polling found Republicans tend to be more critical of technology companies than Democrats and independents. That also played out this week as the Trump campaign wrote a letter to Twitter complaining about the application of the label to Scavino's post, which hadbeen retweeted by President Trump, and requesting a label be applied to a video shared by the Biden campaign. The company said Tuesday it intends to address these issues.\u00a0</p><p>The techlash also continues to be felt on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday blasted Google and Amazon at an antitrust hearing, per The Verge's Adi Robertson . Expect to hear more criticism of Big Tech today as senators on the same committee hold a hearing on the EARN IT Act, a bill with bipartisan sponsors that aims to curb child exploitation online.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The White House plans to convene top tech companies today to discuss the coronavirus outbreak,\u00a0             my colleague Tony Romm reported for the coronavirus live blog             .          </p><p>The meeting, hosted by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, will give technology companies a chance to highlight their efforts to combat the coronavirus. The meeting will include representatives from: FacebookApple, GoogleAmazon, Microsoft and Twitter and select federal agencies. The companies declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests.\u00a0</p><p>The meeting could also address the role tech platforms play in spreading accurate public health information about the disease.</p><p>For instance Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced yesterday it would\u00a0help fund testing efforts in the Bay Area. The Chan Zuckerberg and Gates initiatives have also poured money into developing testing technology.\u00a0</p><p>Tech companies continue to grapple with the fallout from the virus on their businesses. Google yesterday recommended that all workers in North America work at home to diminish the risk of the coronavirus spreading, my colleague Meryl Kornfield reports in the live blog. Offices will remain open for employees with jobs that require on-site work.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Companies across the country are urging workers to stay at home to avoid spreading or catching the coronavirus. But Post             columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found             that even the growing number of on-demand conveniences and smart devices haven't exactly made \"Netflix-and-quarantine life\" easy.          </p><p> \"Quarantine might not seem like a big sacrifice, but my experience shows it's no snow day,\" Geoffrey writes about his eight-day experiment. \"It lays bare the vulnerabilities - and the vulnerable - in our online-everything economy.\"</p><p>For instance, on the third day of working from home Geoff's Internet went down, a scenario that could become commonplace as networks designed for home use see an uptick in remote workers, he writes. To get groceries and food, Geoffrey relied on DoorDash and Instacart. Both companies began promoting \"contactless\" deliveries, but the coronavirus has highlighted inequities in pay and health care the workers face.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges was staying sane in the face of social isolation, Geoffrey writes. \"A group of tech workers and journalists working at home experimented with a version of that on Monday: A 5:00 #WFHHappyHour streamed over Zoom video,\" he writes. \"Sadly, when I joined few participants seemed to actually have cocktails.</p><p>             BYTES: Online dating company Match Group will throw its support behind legislation that could strip tech companies of their liability protections in testimony at a Senate Judiciary hearing today,\u00a0Dan Primack and Margaret Harding McGill at Axios report. The company's support is an outlier in the tech industry, as trade groups and privacy advocates warn the legislation, which aims to limit child exploitation, could deal a blow to encryption.\u00a0          </p><p>\"We don't casually lend our support to this legislation. We do it recognizing there is no cure-all to keeping the internet safe, just as there is none for keeping the world safe,\" Match chief executive Shar Dubey wrote in a memo published to the company's website. \"But, even still, we have to do every bit we can.\"\u00a0</p><p>Match Group announced its support for the legislation as members of the House\u00a0are currently investigating\u00a0its companies for how they handle child predators on their apps.\u00a0</p><p>             The Senate Judiciary Committee today will h             ear opinions from legal experts, child safety advocates and industry lobbyists at the hearing about the bill today.          </p><p>Elizabeth Banker, deputy general counsel at\u00a0tech lobbying group the Internet Association, will also testify. Unlike Match, which is a member of the trade group, Banker will argue that the legislation opens the door for government officials to force clients like Google and Facebook to weaken or refrain from using encryption, according to testimony shared with The Technology 202. She will tell Congress that federal mandates on how companies search for abusive images could create a legal loophole that would make evidence collected by tech companies easier to dismiss in court.</p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>Instacart announced that it would begin offering accrued sick pay for roughly 12,000 part-time workers, my colleague Nitasha Tiku reports. For both part-timers and independent contractors, who both shop and deliver the food, Instacart said that for the next 30 days, it would offer up to 14 days of pay for those diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed in mandatory isolation or quarantine, as directed by state or local officials. (Uber and Lyft also offered something similar.)       </p><p>          But drivers for these services are skeptical they will be able to access the services. Vanessa Bain, an independent contractor for Instacart who has helped organize strikes against the company, says the company has not clarified what 14 days of pay means. In the meantime, Instacart has also been offering high bonuses to incentive shoppers in the Silicon Valley region where Bain works.       </p><p>          The company has also failed to provide workers with supplies to keep them safe, Bain tells Nitasha. Bain and her husband, also an Instacart worker, have had to find their own gloves and have had to use Everclear to disinfect because they are running low on hand-santizer.       </p><p>          \"We're doing what we can to try and keep ourselves and ours customers safe with proper training and supplies.\"       </p><p>          Instacart, the grocery-delivery app, was one of many tech companies publicizing new safety benefits for workers concerned about coronavirus this week, after pressure from regulators like Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.). DoorDash and Postmates also announced new policies this week.       </p><p>DoorDash will provide \"up to two weeks of assistance to Dashers and Caviar couriers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 or who are subject to quarantine at the direction of public health officials,\" the company said in a statement to The Verge. Postmates created a fund that will credit workers for the costs of doctors appointments and medical expenses related to COVID-19's impact in over 22 states, the company announced yesterday.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             -Today:          </p><p>             -Coming up:          </p><p>             -Postponed:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-faabb3b094e749ee80f70609e6ceab59</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD8-9BY1-DXKP-J1H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1902\"/><timeReceived>1:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A new bipartisan Senate report spotlights even more aggressive actions by Kremlin-allied provocateurs to manipulate people offline - influencing Americans to host protests, sign petitions and, in one instance, even teach self-defense classes.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Senate Intelligence Committee - which prepared the report based on a series of hearings over the last two years -\u00a0reported that Facebook identified at least 130 events that were amplified on its platform by Russia's Internet Research Agency, reaching about 338,300 genuine Facebook users who engaged with the content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Russian-backed trolls pushing disinformation have also sought to connect with and potentially coopt individuals to take action in the real world,\" the senators wrote. \"From influencing unwitting Americans to retweet or spread propaganda, to convincing someone to host a real world protest, Russian disinformation agents employ online methods to attract and exploit a wide range of real people.\"</p><p>The Russian operatives were able to organize a series of \"Florida Goes Trump\" rallies using Facebook groups like \"Being Patriotic,\" the Twitter account @March_For_Trump and other fabricated social media personas. Pretending to be Americans, the Russians talked with Trump campaign staff, bought Facebook and Instagram ads and even paid some people \"to portray Hillary Clinton imprisoned in a cage that had been constructed on a flatbed truck for this purpose,\" the report found.\u00a0The report, citing a 2018 indictment, highlights how the IRA in some instances obtained help\u00a0from the Trump campaign in promoting and organizing the rallies.</p><p>Russia's efforts to use social media to exert its influence beyond the virtual world have previously been documented in media reports and the Mueller report. But\u00a0the new Senate report puts the narrative in one place and raises new questions about whether the United States\u00a0is ready if these tactics are repeated ahead of the 2020 election.\u00a0Experts warned that it would be possible for Russian actors -\u00a0and their counterparts in other countries -\u00a0to once again seek to influence real-world events via social media.\u00a0          </p><p>Paul Barrett, a professor at New York University who recently wrote a report on disinformation in 2020, tells me Russia or other foreign actors will likely once again try to stage real-world events like protests and rallies. But he expects the 2020 approach to be more targeted.</p><p>Rather than targeting all African Americans in broad Facebook groups, Barrett predicts mobilizing\u00a0smaller groups, like a minority group living in a specific city, will be the goal.\u00a0</p><p>\"One shift they may make is to go after smaller groups of Americans with a kind of narrowcasting as opposed to broadcasting,\" Barrett told me. \"In doing that, they will try to avoid detection by the social media companies which are much more on their guard this time around than last time.\"\u00a0</p><p>The Senate report outlines broad efforts to influence African Americans in 2016. In one instance,\u00a0Russian actors used the Facebook page \"Black4Black\" to target African-American-led businesses in Cleveland\u00a0to collect personal information in exchange for free promotions on social media. The Russian operation also paid an African American activist\u00a0$700 to teach self-defense classes in a local park through the Facebook page \"Black Fist.\"</p><p>The Senate report underscores how unprepared the social media companies were for Russia\u00a0efforts to plot such events during the last election. Their activity began fairly harmlessly in 2015, when the Russian operatives tried to plan a large event in New York City by offering Americans free hot dogs. Success\u00a0led them to more aggressively use\u00a0the Facebook events feature.</p><p>The events became more politically divisive closer to Election Day. In one instance in May 2016, Russian operatives organized a\u00a0\"Stop Islamization of Texas\"\u00a0event in front of the Islamic Da'wah Center in Houston, using the Facebook page \"Heart of Texas.\" At the same time, the operatives used the\u00a0\"United Muslims for America\" page to organize a competing event, at the same time at the same location. The competing protests escalated, and according to media reports at the time, there were confrontations and verbal attacks.\u00a0</p><p> \"Just getting people at each others throats was a big part of the goal,\" Barrett told me.\u00a0</p><p>             Social media companies have improved since 2016 when it comes to\u00a0detecting fraudulent accounts and pages\u00a0used to create such events. In August, Facebook removed a Washington-area\u00a0event page listing to counter a white-supremacist rally after it found evidence that was part of a new Russian disinformation campaign.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook says it's also getting better at detecting fraudulent accounts, and it has improved its rapid response unit.\u00a0          </p><p>             \"Any act of foreign interference in our elections violates our values,\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said.\u00a0\"That's why we have stepped up our efforts to build strong defenses on multiple fronts. We're working closely with governments, outside experts and other companies to identify threats and share information. We have also invested in technology and people to block and remove fake accounts; find and remove coordinated manipulation campaigns; and bring unprecedented transparency to political advertising.\"</p><p>Barrett says avoiding a repeat of these efforts isn't just up to the social media companies but also the Trump administration (the president himself has repeatedly shed doubt on whether it was the Russians who interfered to help him win, despite broad consensus by the intelligence community).</p><p> \"It would have a huge potential effect if the president of the U.S. made a speech dedicated to warning people about foreign disinformation and even domestic disinformation\u00a0for that matter,\" Barrett said. \"This president is not going to make that speech because he denies the problem exists, and that's a real shame.\"\u00a0</p><p>             BITS: Twitter may have \"inadvertently\" taken emails and phone numbers provided by users for extra account security and used them for advertising purposes, the company announced in a blog post. The company didn't disclose how many users may have been effected but says it ceased the practice last month.</p><p>But the privacy gaffe\u00a0could still land the company in hot water with federal regulators, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The Federal Trade Commission penalized Facebook in a similar case for failing to disclose that it took phone numbers provided for two-factor authentication and used them to target advertisements to users. Twitter is also still under watch from a 2011 agreement with the FTC, the conditions of which could penalize Twitter with heavy fines if the agency decides the recent misuse violates that agreement. Twitter says\u00a0that no personal data was shared with third parties or partners.</p><p>This isn't Twitter's first data-security scandal this year. The company temporarily accidentally disabled tweet protection settings for Android users in January. Months later the company revealed it was \"inadvertently collecting and sharing iOS location data\" with an unnamed party. Both issues were fixed.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: A secret\u00a0intelligence court\u00a0ruled last year that some FBI searches of thousands of pieces of raw intelligence violated the constitutional rights of Americans,Dustin Volz and Byron Tau at the Wall Street Journal report. The ruling - disclosed by the intelligence community Tuesday - marks a rare censure of\u00a0U.S. surveillance activities and prompted fresh criticism of the FBI's oversight of the program.\u00a0</p><p>The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court found between 2017 and 2018 that the FBI was conducting searches targeting Americans that may have violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches. The searches also could have run afoul of the law authorizing the program, which requires that warrantless searches of the surveillance database be backed by criminal investigations or in pursuit of foreign intelligence information. In one case, a contractor used the highly secretive database to search for himself and relatives, Dustin and Byron report.</p><p>The disclosure of the ruling reignited criticism of the controversial government surveillance legal provision that authorized the program, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Some senators argued the revelations underscore why Section 702 should not have been renewed earlier this year.</p><p>\"Today's release demonstrates how baseless the FBI's position was and highlights Congress' constitutional obligation to act independently and strengthen the checks and balances on government surveillance,\" Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote. He also expressed concern that the remaining redacted portions of the court opinion contains additional information \"the public deserves to know.\"</p><p>Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), who moved to let the program expire, criticized President Trump for pushing to reauthorize the program.</p><p>             BYTES: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton says nothing is off limits in the antitrust probe into Google recently launched by Texas and 50 other attorneys general -\u00a0including forcing Google to sell off parts of its company,\u00a0my colleague Tony Romm reports.</p><p>\"We're prepared for whatever the right thing to do is for consumers,\" Paxton (R) said of the probe, the first major states' investigation into Google in nearly a decade. \"All of that's on the table based on what we learn.\"</p><p>A staunch Google critic who tries to avoid using the service himself, Paxton is bolstered by growing bipartisan frustration that the federal government has dropped the ball in regulating Google and other big tech giants. While the probe is currently digging into claims that Google's advertising business unfairly disadvantages consumers and competitors, Paxton said investigators would expand the probe if they determine Google broke the law.\u00a0</p><p>\"If we end up learning things that lead us in other directions, we'll certainly bring those back to the states and talk about whether we expand into other areas,\" he said. This could include Google's search business, which Texas probed nearly a decade ago. Paxton's office is also in the early stages of an investigation into allegations that Google suppresses conservative content.</p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p><p>My colleague Geoffrey A.

But heading into this week's Democratic debates, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is taking aim at the industry's labor practices.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Buttigieg took aim at Uber and Lyft\u00a0in a new economic proposal that\u00a0seeks\u00a0to limit companies' increasingly common practice of classifying workers as independent contractors. Buttigieg argued\u00a0that ride-hailing\u00a0companies' classification of drivers as independent contractors is limiting those workers' basic protections such as minimum wage and overtime pay.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \u00a0Uber and Lyft would likely view Buttigieg's economic proposal as \"an existential threat\" to their entire business models, said Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at the Data and Society Research Institute.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"To me it suggests it's going to be a presidential issue,\" said Rosenblat, the author of \"Uberland: How Algorithms Are Rewriting the Rules of Work.\" \"It raises the issue to a national debate.\"\u00a0</p><p>             And it's not just gig economy companies that Buttigieg put on notice - he also called out Google for classifying many software developers, food service workers and other workers vital to its businesses as contractors. The practice is common at many technology companies.\u00a0</p><p>             Buttigieg's criticism of the tech industry's labor practices came right after he was in the Bay Area fundraising from notable techies,\u00a0including at an event hosted by Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings.          </p><p>             This highlights a larger trend on the 2020 campaign trail: Democratic candidates are blasting the corporate greed and largesse of the tech industry, while still cashing checks from Silicon Valley to fuel their campaigns in a competitive field.\u00a0          </p><p>             By challenging Silicon Valley's reliance on contract workers, Buttigieg also could be trying to show he's not in big tech's pocket despite his support from venture capitalists and tech executives. Buttigieg raised more money from large-dollar donors\u00a0in California between April and June than any other candidate, including home-state Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), according to analysis by The Mercury News, boosted by large donors in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.\u00a0</p><p>             It could be key for Buttigieg to appear independent heading into a second round of debates during a campaign season where the concentration of corporate power has been a key issue.\u00a0          </p><p>Rosenblat said Buttigieg's decision to frame his proposal around gig economy companies reflects a broader \"techlash.\" He's targeting Uber and Lyft after drivers around the country protested unfair wages and other working conditions at the companies as employees celebrated the companies' initial public offerings - a display of the inequalities that persist between contractors and workers.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's low-hanging fruit in some ways that has potential to gain popular support,\" she said.</p><p>             And even one venture capitalist focused on the future of work praised Buttigieg for taking the time to learn about issues related to the gig economy and the tech industry.\u00a0                    Roy Bahat, the head of Bloomberg Beta, praised Buttigieg for taking the time to get to know Silicon Valley\u00a0venture capitalists when they did a tour of the Midwest last year called \"The Comeback Cities Tour.\"\u00a0       </p><p>             \"[Buttigieg]             \u00a0is addressing the issues that are live issues right now,\" Bahat said. \"One of the things we need is better mutual understanding between tech industry and rest of America so we're not foreigners to each other.\"\u00a0          </p><p>             Buttigieg has not been as aggressive as some of his Democratic peers in attacking the size and power of the technology industry. Others such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have said that big technology firms like Facebook, Google and Amazon need to be broken up. Buttigieg has so far only raised\u00a0concerns about the consolidation of corporate power and said that the Federal Trade Commission should be empowered so it can better address monopolies.</p><p>\"Antitrust law as we know it has begun to hit its limits with regulating tech companies,\" Buttigieg said at an event in April, according to The Verge. \"It's not designed to handle some of these tech companies where there's actually no price at all. The product is made free, or at least it's free on its face. We've learned in part because of the way our data are used by these companies that nothing is actually free.\"</p><p>Buttigieg's plan would overhaul existing labor laws so that employers would have to demonstrate that workers are free from employer's control or customarily work as an independent business in the industry to classify employees as independent contractors.\u00a0</p><p>Lyft did not respond to a request for comment. Uber said in a statement that the company hears drivers value the flexibility the companies' contracting positions offer.</p><p>\"We believe that independent, on-demand workers should not have to sacrifice security to enjoy that flexibility,\" Uber said in a statement. \"That's why we've been at the table with stakeholders offering a plan that would guarantee drivers an earnings floor tied to minimum wage plus expenses; a robust package of portable benefits they can access no matter which ride-share company they drive for; and meaningful representation that gives them a say on matters affecting their lives and livelihood.\"       </p><p>             Clarification:This article has been updated to clarify Alex Rosenblat's remarks on the business models of ride sharing companies.          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) wants to ban autoplaying YouTube videos, never-ending Instagram feeds and \"Snapstreaks.\"\u00a0Hawley\u00a0released a bill today that aims to cut down on social media addiction by banning companies from deploying \"deceptive techniques that tech companies use to exploit users,\"\u00a0according to a news release from his office.\u00a0</p><p>The Social Media Addiction\u00a0Reduction Technology Act would require social media companies to have natural stopping points, and ban the companies from deploying features like infinite scroll or other \"achievements\" like Snapstreaks that keep users returning to an app. The bill would also give the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to ban other similar practices. Companies would also be required to provide an in-app tool that allows users to track the amount of time they spend on a social media service across all devices and impose caps on those times.\u00a0</p><p>\"Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction,\" Hawley said.\u00a0\"Too much of the 'innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.\"</p><p>The Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood, which has been calling for greater accountability for the tech companies' treatment of kids, praised the legislation.\u00a0\"Social media companies deploy a host of tactics designed to manipulate users in ways that undermines their well-being,\" Josh Golin, executive director of Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood said. \"We commend Senator Hawley for introducing legislation that would prohibit some of the most exploitative tactics, including those frequently deployed on children and teens.\" Facebook, Google and Snap did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Nigerian scammers are using Facebook as a \"one-stop shop\" to impersonate members of the U.S. military and con vulnerable Americans into sending them money, gifts, and their hearts,Jack Nicas at the New York Times reports. The social media giant and U.S. military have struggled to curb the uptick of \"love hoaxes,\" leading to devastating consequences for victims of the global fraud.</p><p>One impersonator, using the name Michael Chris, conned a Delaware woman out of tens of thousands of dollars over two years. The real-life Marine Corps sergeant impersonated by Chris has discovered hundreds of fake profiles using his likeness.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook relies on software to detect scam-like behavior and user reports to remove billions of scam accounts each year, it tells the Times. It also recently added facial recognition technology \"that can automatically spot impostors of some of the most commonly impersonated service members.\" But tests run by the Times showed the software doesn't always work and reports are often ignored. Facebook and Instagram left up dozens of accounts flagged by the paper\u00a0- including those of high-ranking military officials.</p><p>The volume of spam accounts on Facebook and difficulty prosecuting love scams makes the problem difficult for the military to tackle. \"You contact a social media platform; you ask them to take it down; they do. Within 15 minutes, more pop up,\" Chris Grey, a spokesman for the Army's Criminal Investigation Command, told the Times.</p><p>             BYTES: The European Union's top court ruled yesterday that sites with Facebook \"Like\" buttons could be held liable for violating European privacy laws - even if it's\u00a0Facebook that ultimately collects the data. The new\u00a0ruling could crack down on Facebook's ability to track users across a number of websites in countries protected by European privacy law.</p><p>In the case in question, the court decided that a German fashion site commercially benefited from automatically sharing user data through a \"like\" button because it allowed the site to \"optimize its goods for publicity.\" Consequently, it was responsible for notifying visitors that just loading its Web page transmitted their data to Facebook. Facebook has long used features such as\u00a0its \"like\" button to track visitors across websites, regardless of whether they're Facebook users.</p><p>\"We are carefully reviewing the court's decision and will work closely with our partners to ensure they can continue to benefit from our social plugins and other business tools in full compliance with the law,\" Facebook associate general counsel Jack Gilbert told Tech Crunch. Facebook has not announced any changes to how its \"like\" buttons work, but may have to do so as a result of the ruling.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>Chinese technology giant Huawei is positioned to be the global leader in 5G technology, and that could have serious national security implications for the U.S. But why has Huawei become so controversial in the midst of tense trade negotiations between the United States and China?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-44b6560044294099ad08c8ad3904b8ee</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP8-W4B1-JB4M-V0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1804\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He suggested that 75-year-old Martin Gugino, a Buffalo activist injured after police pushed him to the ground at a protest, was a member of antifa. Trump has repeatedly said without evidence that the loose collection of anti-facists are promoting violence and other crimes during the protests against racial injustice.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          He also insinuated that Gugino, who hit his head and was bleeding in the footage of the incident, was somehow faking it and fell rather than being pushed. \"Could be a set up?\" he asked.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             That question mark at the end was key. As pressure mounted on the platform to once again police Trump's speech, Twitter ultimately determined this particular tweet doesn't violate its policies and took no action. In an email sent to me, the company noted Trump's tweet was speculative. Meanwhile, the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the missive a score of \"Four Pinocchios\" for blantant falsehood.\u00a0</p><p>             Including question marks in his tweets about inflammatory subjects is part of a larger pattern that Trump uses to distance himself from the consequences of his most outrageous rockets.          </p><p>          Social media is filled with speculation, and framing the Buffalo hoax that way allowed Trump to skirt the already vague rules governing social media platforms, and avoid an already rare fact check from them. But asking a question rather than making an assertion still achieves what seems to be Trump's ultimate goal in this case, amplifying and spreading false information that his followers may believe: more than 40,000 people have retweeted it and 159,000 people have liked this tweet.\u00a0          </p><p>The end result is the antifa \"boogeyman\" narrative gains more traction, and Gugino becomes a target for harassment online, Kate Starbird, an associate professor of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, noted in a tweet.       </p><p>          Trump recently used similar speculative language in another controversial set of tweets, which sparked broad debate about what the company should allow on its service. He suggested           without evidence that Lori Klausutis might have been having an affair with MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, who she worked for, and the then-congressman might have even killed her. As he doubled down on the troubling conspiracy, Trump again turned to speculative language: \"In 2016 when Joe &amp; his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking about about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing? Maybe or maybe not, but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job, and I knew him well, far better than most. So many unanswered &amp; obvious questions, but I won't bring them up now! Law enforcement eventually will?\"</p><p>Starbird tells me she thinks Trump has long framed hoaxes this way.\u00a0</p><p>\"Though this style of speech may reflect a broader set of norms of online speech that have, in part, developed as a way to evade content moderation, I am not convinced that Trump is strategically using this style to avoid platform censorship,\" she said in an email. \"It's more likely that he has adopted this way of tweeting (and speaking) more generally as a way to be able to spread politically useful narratives without having to take responsibility when they are proven false.\"</p><p>Tech companies are under pressure to re-evaluate their existing policies as the human costs of these false posts becomes clear.\u00a0</p><p>Twitter has frequently evolving rules that aim to keep violence, harassment and misinformation about sensitive issues like elections or the coronavirus off its service. Trump's tweets often creep up to or appear to even cross those lines, but the company has until very recently allowed them to remain unfettered on the platform because it views them as \"newsworthy\" and probably doesn't want to invite meddling from Washington.       </p><p>Twitter has said its rethinking its policies after Klausutis's widow, Timothy J. Klausutis, called on the company to delete Trump's tweets smearing the memory of his late wife.\u00a0</p><p>\"We've been working to expand existing product features and policies so we can more effectively address things like this going forward, and we hope to have those changes in place shortly,\" the company said in a statement at the time.\u00a0</p><p>Timothy J. Klausutis highlighted the consequences of the companies' inaction in the letter.\u00a0</p><p>\"I'm asking you to intervene in this instance because the President of the United States has taken something that does not belong him - the memory of my dead wife - and perverted it for perceived political gain,\" he wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Critics widely blasted Twitter's decision not to label those posts in some way. \u00a0Multiple experts warn that Trump's targeting of individual, private citizens in tweets can lead to doxxing, in which a name or other personal details about someone is released online to incite digital attacks. Gugino could be next after Trump's tweet, said Melissa Ryan, the founder of CARD Strategies, a consulting firm that helps organizations handle disinformation.\u00a0</p><p>             \"This man is going to get harassment,\" Ryan said. \"He's potentially going to be doxxed because his name has been put out by the president.\"          </p><p>Ryan noted that one of Twitter's own employees fell victim to this tactic. Trump recently targeted a Twitter employee, Yoel Roth, in his tweets. The president tagged Roth in a post, calling him a \"hater\" after Twitter took the unprecedented step of labeling a pair of the president's tweets that made misleading claims about mail-in voting. Roth was one of the co-authors on Twitter's blog post explaining why the tweets were labeled, and media outlets surfaced several anti-Trump tweets that Roth had shared several years ago. \u00a0</p><p>\"It's becoming a strategy that the Trump administration is more and more comfortable using, and Twitter has to figure out if they're comfortable with their platform being used that way,\" Ryan said. \"It's on Twitter to make that decision that they're not going to let their platform be used that way.\"\u00a0</p><p>In cases of inflammatory or clearly false information disseminated by Trump, Twitter should consider consistently labeling the president's posts and preventing them from being amplified, Ryan said. The company did step in recently to shield the public from a tweet by Trump that violated its policies against glorifying violence after the president decried violent protesters against racial injustice, saying \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"</p><p>Starbird suggested the tech companies expand their policies to cover more bad behavior.\u00a0</p><p>\"The platforms could create policies specially around false conspiracy theories that lead to targeted harassment of a private individual - and connect those to some of their existing policies about harm and harassment,\" she told me.\u00a0</p><p>Silicon Valley's Trump problem isn't going away. These debates will only get more heated closer to Election Day.\u00a0</p><p>The debate over Trump's posts has escalated in recent weeks, as Twitter has taken unprecedented steps to label and limit the spread of a handful of the president's tweets. Meanwhile, Facebook has taken a totally hands-off approach, allowing the president's remarks to remain unlabeled on its service.\u00a0</p><p>Experts are hopeful that Twitter will limit the president's tweets that name private individuals given recent controversies.</p><p>\"It feels like Twitter and the Trump administration has been in a game of Chicken for a while,\" Ryan said. \u00a0\"And Twitter clearly has made the decision that they're done playing this game. We will probably see a policy in the next month that pertains to this kind of thing, and it will be interesting to see what it is.\"\u00a0</p><p>             However, any actions by the companies to limit the president's social media activity risks further inflaming tensions with conservatives in Washington.\u00a0          </p><p>Just yesterday, a group of Senate Republicans wrote a letter calling the Federal Communications Commission to evaluate the scope of Section 230, a legal provision that gives tech companies immunity from lawsuits for the photos and posts people share on their services. Trump signed an executive order directing the agency to review the provision as he railed against Twitter's labels on his tweets and accused the company of being biased.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon, Facebook and Google are quietly funding political groups to use fingerprint-free tactics to battle antitrust probes.</p><p>Groups such as the Connected Commerce Council have used voices of local business owners to drum up support for Google, Tony Romm reports.\u00a0</p><p>In one instance, an organization known as 3C wrote an op-ed in an Arizona paper on the behalf of David Espinoza, a shoemaker. The piece did not indicate it was largely penned by 3C, and it railed against regulator's campaigns against Google.\u00a0</p><p>Espinoza had no idea the group was funded by the search giant until he was contacted by The Post. 3C also counts Facebook and Amazon as partners.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is our responsibility, on behalf of our small-business members, to protect the existing model and promote the market, which is working exceedingly well,\" said Jake Ward, 3C president. \"We are not, and will not work for, big tech.\"</p><p>             The tech industry's ramped-up efforts to use such groups to shore up its public image reflect the seriousness of growing antitrust scrutiny from state and federal regulators. State and federal regulators             are currently investigating             Google for anti-competitive behavior.          </p><p>The tech industry has also funneled money into conservative groups that align with anti-regulation. One group, the National Taxpayers Union, recently conducted a poll focused on states actively investigating Google and other tech companies and determined voters would rather see their attorneys general focusing on other issues. The group declined to discuss its donors or why it commissioned the poll.</p><p>Similar research has been used to sway opinion in antitrust probes before, former regulators tell Tony.\u00a0</p><p> \"It's meant to \"press upon public officials, and indirectly upon agencies, that [companies] enjoy broad public support for what they're doing,\" said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University's law school who previously served on the Federal Trade Commission. \"To tamper with them in a significant way is to anger the broader public.\"</p><p>More advertisers are stepping away from Facebook in light of the platform's hands-off approach to Trump's inflammatory posts.</p><p>Facebook's unwillingness to crack down on Trump's posts could be costing it millions of dollars following already decreased ad spending during the pandemic, Tiffany Hsu and Cecilia Kang at the New York Times report.</p><p>\"For the past couple of years, this problem has become bigger and bigger. These massive platforms have to care about free speech issues to some extent, but Facebook is on the extreme end of not caring,\" said \u00a0Nima Gardideh, the co-founder of a digital advertising agency that has encouraged clients to hold back millions in advertising dollars from Facebook.</p><p>Last week, Braze, a software company in New York, withdrew a Facebook ad campaign valued at around $60,000 dollars. The company cited Facebook's decisions to leave up Trump's statements in its decision.</p><p>\"Facebook is the biggest publishing platform arguably in the world, so of course we want to be on it,\" said Sara Spivey, chief marketing office at software company Brave. \"But the bigger question is Facebook's responsibility to make its platform safe and if we want to be associated with it.\"</p><p>             But it's unclear how long advertisers will continue to give the platform the cold shoulder.          </p><p>The majority of Facebook's 8 million advertisers are small businesses who \"depend and rely on our platforms,\" said Carolyn Everson, who heads marketing solutions at Facebook. And Gardideh conceded that many of his clients were likely to return to Facebook because it \"is just the best option there is right now, in terms of cost and scale.\"</p><p>The Open Technology Institute and Public Knowledge, two Washington-based tech nonprofit groups, announced they are rejecting future funding from Facebook.\u00a0</p><p>          \"With over 2.6 billion users, Facebook has a clear responsibility to reckon with its role in these systems or risk continuing to facilitate oppression that imperils Black lives,\" OTI Director Sarah Morris said in a statement announcing the news. \"While Facebook has suggested it may revisit its policies around false and incendiary political speech, the totality of the company's words, timing, and actions matters.\"       </p><p>             The Open Technology Institute received $130,000 in funding from Facebook between June 2019 and June 2020.          </p><p>Public Knowledge also announced it would no longer accept funding, citing a June 1 meeting between civil rights leaders and Mark Zuckerberg over the moderation of Trump's comments. The group, which has strongly advocated for free speech online, said it stands in solidarity with the civil rights community.\u00a0</p><p>\"Platforms shouldn't hide behind the First Amendment as an excuse to allow hate, misinformation and abuse to run rampant on their services, particularly when they hold such a dominant position in the marketplace,\" said president and chief executive Chris Lewis. \"We believe Facebook can do better, and we call upon the company to play a constructive role in allowing a civil discourse online.\"</p><p>Public Knowledge received more than $25,000 from Facebook in 2018-2019</p><p>             The announcements are a significant stand against Facebook given the company's prominent role in funding tech organizations in Washington. Facebook spends upward of at least $1 million a year on privacy and technology nonprofit groups and think tanks including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Brookings Institute and Access Now.</p><p>          \"We've heard from some organizations about their disagreement with a number of the content decisions we've made and we appreciate their feedback,\" Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to work with them on these important topics and others.\"       </p><p>But its unclear whether the activism will spread behind Facebook. Both groups count Google and other tech companies among their funders, a relationship that some activists have criticized in the past.</p><p>Yelp's head of public policy criticized both groups for continuing to accept money from Google:</p><p>Kevin Bankston, a former director of OTI who now works at Facebook, said the news was \"sad\" but that Facebook \"can and must do better.\"</p><p>Joe Biden's campaign ramped up spending on Facebook to target Trump's response to the protests over the killing of George Floyd. \u00a0</p><p>Biden spent about $5 million last week, or as much money as he did during the first 10 months of his candidacy, Kate Sullivan, Sarah Mucha and Fredreka Schouten at CNN report.</p><p>The campaign also spent more than $1 million on Google last week. This week it will launch a new digital ad campaign targeting young voters in battleground states with a recent speech by Biden on racism.\u00a0</p><p>The Trump campaign spent just $1.27 million on Facebook ads last week, a notable pullback on the campaign's aggressive spending on the platform.</p><p>Twitch co-founder Michael Seibel will join Reddit's board, the company announced today.</p><p>Seibel will be taking a position formerly held by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who resigned from the company's board last week with a request that the company replace him with the black board member.</p><p>          Seibel is a partner at Y Combinator and chief executive of the YC startup accelerator program, which first helped launch Reddit in 2005. Seibel also has a background in politics, previously serving as the finance director for the Maryland Senate campaign of former NAACP president Kweisi Mfume.       </p><p>          \"Few people have Michael's deep background in tech and know the challenges and opportunities we face as well as he does,\" said Reddit chief executive and co-founder Steve Huffman, \"so we are honored he is joining us. Not to mention, he is one of the smartest and kindest people in tech.\"       </p><p>             A new board member could be just the beginning of changes at Reddit in response to renewed concerns over diversity.          </p><p>             Moderators from more than 650 subreddits have signed an open letter to Huffman urging the company to enact a sitewide policy against racism and to be proactive in banning hate-based communities and users. The letter also urges the company to hire more minorities and women.</p><p>          Employees and activists are pressuring more tech companies to cut ties with local police following recent protests.       </p><p>          Hundreds of Microsoft employees signed a letter requesting that the company cancel contracts with the Seattle Police Department and other law enforcement, OneZero's Dave Gershgorn reported.</p><p>          The letter also asks for the company to support defunding the Seattle Police and formally condemn the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other violent actions toward protesters. \"Every one of us in the [email copy] line are either firsthand witnesses or direct victims to the inhumane responses of SPD to peaceful protesting,\" the letter said, according to the copy obtained by OneZero.\u00a0       </p><p> \"As a company, we need to look inside, examine our organization, and do better,\" chief executive Satya Nadella responded in a statement.</p><p>Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, a group of Amazon employee activists, also signed on in support of defunding the Seattle Police Department. The group has not yet made the same demands of Amazon leadership.</p><p>             Meanwhile, community activists are pushing Facebook to cease funding to the Menlo Park Police Department,Sarah Emerson at OneZero reports. Facebook pledged $11.2 million to its operations in 2017 and brokered a deal with the city to fund its own police force to patrol its headquarters and the surrounding areas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-bcbaca1e9c5e482389c17996fc1a70eb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603N-N2P1-JB4M-V0RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3026\"/><timeReceived>1:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 10, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But civil rights leaders want more companies to follow Facebook's lead and welcome independent scrutiny about how their policies and products might discriminate against minorities.\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          Vanita Gupta, the president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Human and Civil Rights, described Facebook's sweeping review as \"the first of its kind.\"\u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">          \"We believe that all tech companies should be doing this,\" Gupta told me in an interview. \u00a0       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook yesterday rolled out a long-awaited final report on the two-year process, which delivered a blistering assessment of the company's decisions, particularly its hands-off approach to incendiary posts from President Trump.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"This is an important tool to ensure that the platforms are addressing very serious civil rights concerns that have been newly emerging as the platforms have been evolving,\" said Gupta, who met several times with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg throughout the process.\u00a0       </p><p>Tech companies are under pressure to limit hate speech and discrimination amid a national reckoning on race.\u00a0</p><p>Much of the attention has been on Facebook in recent weeks, especially as pressure mounts from civil rights leaders, advertisers and its own employees to take a harder line on voter suppression. But no social network has a perfect record on dealing with vitriol or disinformation, and pressure is mounting for the whole industry to take stock amid national protests in the wake of George Floyd's death.</p><p>             Some activists want to see other companies also adopt some of the recommendations put forth in the audit of Facebook, such as hiring more people with civil rights expertise.\u00a0</p><p>          The leaders of Color of Change, another civil rights group that met with Facebook this week, called for all major tech companies to also \"implement a permanent civil rights infrastructure\" to help address and ultimately prevent misinformation, harassment, voter suppression and content by hate groups.\u00a0       </p><p>There's some precedent for other companies engaging in independent reviews.</p><p>Companies tend to undertake an audit process in the wake of controversies or scandals - though they have not been as wide-ranging as the recent process at Facebook. Laura Murphy, who led the audit at Facebook, also wrote a 2016 report on discrimination at Airbnb and subsequently worked closely with the company on improving its policies. Former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder's law firm led a wide-ranging report into workplace culture at Uber in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment at the company.</p><p>Facebook launched its own process in the summer of 2018, after years of complaints by civil rights groups that the company foments hatred, stemming back to when the social network was used to organize a 2017 Neo-Nazi march in Chartlottesville, Va., as Elizabeth Dwoskin and I reported. The company has touted the audit as a sign of its commitment to addressing civil rights issues. The audit contributed to the company's creation of a policy to address disinformation related to the census, as well as overhauling housing and job ads in response to discrimination complaints.\u00a0</p><p>             Yet it remains to be seen which recommendations Facebook will adopt from the final report, and how it will impact the company's course of action on issues of speech, especially comments from Trump in the months leading up to the 2020 election. \u00a0</p><p>Civil rights audits could have key implications for the debate over the future of tech regulation in Washington.\u00a0</p><p>Gupta says she expects lawmakers to draw from the findings of Facebook's report as Mark Zuckerberg returns to Washington later this month to testify in front of the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.\u00a0</p><p>\"This document is going to be used to help inform what the longer-term trajectory is on the public law and regulation conversation happening,\" she told me.\u00a0</p><p>Audits could prove to be a powerful tool for civil rights activists who have been trying to force change at companies.</p><p>The Facebook audit reinforced and shed new light on many of the complaints civil rights leaders have had for years about the company's handling of issues such as voter suppression or exemption for politicians' speech.\u00a0</p><p>It's certain that they're going to keep pushing on Facebook in light of the searing report's findings.\u00a0</p><p>\"There should not be a 'final' civil rights audit when hate and election misinformation continue endangering our lives and democracy,\" said Jessica J. Gonz\u00e1lez, Co-CEO of Free Press and co-founder of Change the Terms, who met with Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives yesterday. \"Mark Zuckerberg cannot lead Facebook to stop hateful activity from spreading when he is unable to acknowledge how far behind Facebook truly is when it comes to protecting people of color from the danger the platform continues to pose to our lives.\"\u00a0</p><p>Facebook shut down a network of accounts affiliated with Roger Stone for manipulation.\u00a0</p><p>          Stone, a felon and longtime friend of Trump's, used fake accounts and other deceptive measures to manipulate public debate, the social network said. The company removed more than 100 accounts and pages affiliated with Stone for breaking its policies on \"coordinated inauthentic behavior,\" Craig Timberg and Isaac Stanley-Becker wrote.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>          The violating activity dated back to 2015 but was notably active during the 2016 presidential election cycle, when Stone was advising Trump's presidential campaign, and in 2017, as federal investigators were probing him.\u00a0       </p><p>          Stone on some occasions amplified posts made by anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, which at the time was publishing damaging Democratic Party emails initially stolen by Russian hackers, Facebook said.       </p><p>          Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy for Facebook, said that Stone's personal accounts were shut down. Of Stone's personal accounts, Gleicher said, \"We saw them deeply enmeshed in the activity here.\"       </p><p>TikTok says it removed removed 49,247,689 videos globally during the second half of 2020.\u00a0</p><p>The company publicized the figure in its second transparency report, which aims to shed light on content moderation decisions and responses to government data requests. TikTok released the report this morning as it faces global scrutiny, including in the United States where Trump has said he's considering banning the Chinese social app to punish China over the coronavirus.\u00a0</p><p>TikTok removed the most videos in India, where it is now banned. The company took down 16,453,360 during the six month period beginning in July 2019. TikTok reported taking down 4,576,888 videos in the United States.\u00a0</p><p>The company also disclosed how many government law enforcement requests in received from countries around the world. China and Hong Kong were notably absent from the list, as the company faces concerns in Washington that it could be sharing data with the Chinese government.\u00a0</p><p>The company told the Wall Street Journal that the Chinese government has never requested access to any of its user data and that TikTok wouldn't share any if asked. TikTok received no requests from Hong Kong during 2019, noting that it's been a relatively small market. TikTok pulled its app from Hong Kong this week as the government adopted a restrictive new law that could force companies doing business there to provide data to the Chinese government.\u00a0</p><p>TikTok did receive 100 total requests from the U.S. government during the second half of 2020, and it produced some data in 82 percent of those instances.\u00a0</p><p>Amazon told sellers they will no longer be able to anonymously sell products on its U.S. site.</p><p>          The e-commerce service said the policy           change           would \"help customers make informed shopping decisions.\" But my colleague Jay Greene notes the move could also help curb           sales of dangerous           and           counterfeit items,           which Jeff Bezos could face questions about when testifies before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee later this month. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.)       </p><p>The company announced the change on its website where it shares information with the sellers who list goods on its site. \"Amazon doesn't do random things just to try to help consumers,\" said Juozas Kaziukenas, CEO of the e-commerce research firm Marketplace Pulse.</p><p>Kaziukenas said the company may have made the move to get ahead of the upcoming hearing, which will also include the chief executives of Facebook, Google and Apple. The Trump administration targeted counterfeit sales from foreign companies, saying in a 54-page report in January that online marketplaces such as Amazon have fostered counterfeiters.</p><p>Japan's theme parks stole my 2020 motto:\u00a0</p><p>A new report revealed thousands of contracts between Big Tech and federal law enforcement agencies.\u00a0</p><p>          The Pentagon and federal law enforcement agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, have secured thousands of deals with major tech companies that have not been previously reported,           April Glaser reports for NBC. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Hewlett Packard and even Facebook are among companies with ties to these agencies, according to new research from the technology accountability nonprofit Tech Inquiry.\u00a0</p><p>Jack Poulson, a former Google research scientist who left the company in 2018 after months of efforts to get clarity about plans to deploy a censored version of its search engine in China called Project Dragonfly, led the research. Poulson studied more than 30 million government contracts signed or modified in the past five years.\u00a0</p><p>He uncovered that many of the consumer-facing tech companies are subtracting with the government. Often the procurement contracts mask the depth of the relationship between companies and the government, he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Often the high-level contract description between tech companies and the military looks very vanilla and mundane,\" Poulson said in an interview with NBC. \"But only when you look at the details of the contract, which you can only get through Freedom of Information [Act] requests, do you see the workings of how the customization from a tech company would actually be involved.\"</p><p>Twitter is developing a subscription service that could boost revenue.\u00a0</p><p>The San Francisco social network said in a job listing for a senior software engineer that it was \"building a subscription platform\" under a team code-named \"Gryphon,\" The Wall Street Journal reports. The company is seeking a payment and subscription client work lead.</p><p>\"This is a first for Twitter!,\" the company said in the posting.</p><p>Are the Zoomers alright?\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-f302a5704fc24005b3c293c0d432dfb9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609V-TC31-JB4M-V0T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1817\"/><timeReceived>1:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0(D-N.Y.) is now facing at least two lawsuits from critics she blocked\u00a0on social media after a federal appeals court\u00a0ruled President Trump cannot shut off his critics on Twitter.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joseph Saladino, a YouTuber whose video pranks have been criticized as racist, told me in an interview yesterday he is filing a complaint that argues Ocasio-Cortez violated the First Amendment\u00a0when she blocked him in May.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Saladino, who is running as a Republican in\u00a0New York's 11th district, sees it as a test for whether the legal system will hold Democrats to the same standard it held the president.\u00a0\"I want to see if the standards apply equally,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the same day, former Democratic New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind separately\u00a0sued Ocasio-Cortez for blocking him. He told\u00a0Fox News that like Trump, Ocasio-Cortez uses her account for political and policy commentary\u00a0--- \"so to shut a citizen off from her statements is a problem,\u00a0as well as blocking me from petitioning her or seeking redress.\"\u00a0</p><p>He tweeted:\u00a0</p><p>             The lawsuits against Ocasio-Cortez could be just the beginning. The appeals court decision, which upheld an earlier ruling that Trump violated the First Amendment when he blocked users who criticized him or his policies on the Twitter feed he uses to communicate with the public, could have wide-ranging consequences for how all elected officials manage their social media accounts.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think the principles applied by the court apply much more broadly to public officials across the country and at all levels of government,\" Katie Fallow, a senior attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told me. Fallow represented the individuals who sued Trump for blocking them.</p><p>Fallow said if Ocasio-Cortez uses her Twitter account to conduct official business and using government resources to run it, the court's ruling against Trump would likely make her vulnerable in court. The appeals court ruled that public officials discussing government business on social media cannot exclude people from an otherwise open online dialogue, siding against Justice Department lawyers who argued that @realDonaldTrump is a personal account and can block followers he \"does\u00a0not wish to hear,\"\u00a0my colleague Ann E. Marimow reports.</p><p>Fallow said she had not looked closely at Ocasio-Cortez's account to determine if it is being used the same way as Trump's. However, Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0frequently posts policy positions on Twitter and\u00a0often wields her Twitter account to drive the political conversation.\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most prominent Democrats on Twitter\u00a0with 4.6 million followers - which is about 2 million more than the country's most powerful Democrat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0</p><p>Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, said in an email they're \"looking into the ruling\" against Trump. He declined to comment on pending litigation and did not respond to a question about whether Ocasio-Cortez plans to continue blocking accounts that have publicly complained.\u00a0He also did not say whether Ocasio-Cortez would stop blocking accounts in the future.\u00a0</p><p>             It's not just individuals who are complaining about Ocasio-Cortez blocking them on Twitter. The right-wing publication Daily Caller also called out Ocasio-Cortez for blocking its account\u00a0in a Facebook post about the court's ruling. Neil Patel, the co-founder and publisher of The Daily Caller, told me yesterday the publication is still blocked by Ocasio-Cortez, but it does not have plans to sue her.\u00a0</p><p>\"We aren't sure what she's afraid of,\" Patel told me. \"We are for free speech and happy to debate anyone.\"</p><p>             But though Ocasio-Cortez is in the spotlight, she's not the only politician besides Trump to face criticism for blocking users on social media. Earlier this year, the New York Civil Liberties Union sent\u00a0Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.) a letter complaining that he was blocking more than 70 constituents on his Facebook page and said it would sue King if people remained blocked.\u00a0</p><p>The NYCLU says in response King's office created a new, official Facebook page that won't block users based on their opinion. His original page will be used only for campaign purposes.\u00a0</p><p>\"I maintain my campaign Facebook page and have started a government Facebook page to accompany the government Twitter account which I have had for a number of years without ever blocking anyone,\" King told me in a statement.\u00a0\"This is a\u00a0win-win.\"\u00a0</p><p>The ripple effects could extend across the country. Gary Fineout, a Florida-based reporter, noted the ruling could have implications in his home state:</p><p>             Today at 4 p.m.\u00a0The Washington Post will bring together top innovators, key government officials, cutting-edge urban planners and business leaders to discuss how \"smart city\" technologies, new digital infrastructures and groundbreaking ideas about mobility are reshaping the cities of today and laying the foundation for cities of the future. You can sign up for the livestream\u00a0here.          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Trump will host Republican operatives and social media stars at a White House summit about social media tomorrow. But critics warn the event could end up \"empowering online provocateurs who have adopted controversial political tactics entering the 2020 election campaign,\"\u00a0my colleagues Tony Romm, Michael Scherer and Amy B. Wang report.       </p><p>          \"They're advocating for a particular kind of social media system where they are allowed to harass, defame, [and] post indecent content, and not be censured for it, and not be moderated in any way,\" Joan Donovan, the director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University told my colleagues. \"They want the benefits of social media with none of the civility.\"       </p><p>          The guests invited include Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe, whose recently released a video aimed at making Google look biased against Republicans that was then\u00a0cited by Trump. Ben Garrison, a cartoonist who has been criticized for hateful imagery, also said he was invited to the summit. However The White House told Politico last night that Garrison will no longer be attending.\u00a0       </p><p>          The White House did not invite any of the major tech platforms being discussed.\u00a0                       Trump has ramped up his claims\u00a0that Facebook, Google, and Twitter censor conservative users over the past month - often citing widely disputed evidence.\u00a0Tech companies have repeatedly denied claims of anti-conservative bias.\u00a0Trump's campaign has purchased millions of dollars in ads on Facebook and Google this election cycle alone and he's a frequent user of Twitter, where he has more than 61 million followers.       </p><p>             NIBBLES: Twitter will no longer allow users to post statements that dehumanize or attack people on religious grounds,my colleague Hamza Shaban reported yesterday. Examples of tweets that the company will now remove include statements calling a religious group \"rats,\" \"maggots,\" \"filthy animals,\" and \"viruses.\"</p><p>This is the second major change to Twitter's moderation policy since a March shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand cast increased scrutiny on the role social media platforms play in online extremism. Twitter changed its platform to reduce the visibility of violating content by public officials last month. Twitter began exploring a policy banning dehmanizing speech in September, but after feedback narrowed the policy to focus on attacks against religious groups\u00a0the New York Time's Kate Conger reported.\u00a0The company hasn't ruled out expanding the policy to cover other protected classes and said in a blog post it's looking at expanding the scope of the policy.</p><p>Madihha Ahussain, special counsel for anti-Muslim bigotry at the non-profit Muslim Advocates called the new policy \"a very positive step in the right direction\" but questioned Twitter's commitment to enforcement.</p><p> \"Twitter has the potential to stop the spread of dangerous attack and conspiracy theories against Muslims and others that incite threats and violence, but only if its policies are robust and comprehensive,\" Ahussain said in a statement. She cited the company's refusal to remove an April tweet by Trump that attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and spurred death threats against the Muslim lawmaker as one example of Twitter's failure to take hate speech seriously.</p><p>But advocates were not completely satisfied by the company's changes and\u00a0questioned Twitter's reluctance to ban all forms of dehumanization.</p><p>          \"Twitter's failure to ban all forms of dehumanization immediately casts doubt on the company's commitment to fully stopping hate on the platform,\" Rashad Robinson, the president of online racial justice group Color of Change, said in a statement.</p><p>             BYTES: Representatives from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google will testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee about antitrust concerns next Tuesday, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The hearing will give House lawmakers their first crack at grilling Big Tech companies directly about bipartisan concerns over potential antitrust violations.</p><p>Scheduled to testify are Kyle Andeer, Apple's vice president for corporate law and chief compliance officer; Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon; Matt Perault, the head of global policy development at Facebook; and Adam Cohen, the director of economic policy at Google. The last hearing in the series focused on the impact of platforms including Facebook and Google on the news industry but neither company attended.</p><p>Tech companies have long denied allegations that their businesses are anti-competitive, but growing government scrutiny has forced them to go on the defensive.\u00a0Federal regulators are also looking into potential antitrust violations; the Federal Trade Commission will be investigating Amazon while the Justice Department will have jurisdiction over Google, Tony previously reported.</p><p>As a part of its probe, the House has vowed to also take a look at \"the government's own competition laws and enforcement agencies,\" Tony writes. Advocates have criticized the FTC for failing to enforce its own regulations against Facebook, causing some to question if imbuing the agency with more antitrust powers would make a difference.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             Today:          </p><p>Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) accused YouTube of\u00a0prioritizing ad revenue over children's safety in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday.

Meadows told the companies their \"freelance\" approach\u00a0to making content decisions is \"over with.\"</p><p>\"Even if it takes extreme measures, you have now collided with a bipartisan issue for different reasons, and we'll make sure that we do that,\" he said.</p><p>Democrats and Republicans alike have been escalating their attacks on the tech giants in recent months. As prominent Democratic presidential candidates make calls to break up Facebook, the White House has stepped up its own attacks against the social network, as well as Google-owned YouTube and Twitter. The White House last week\u00a0launched a tool where people could submit stories about times they felt they experienced bias on these services.\u00a0</p><p>Some of Trump's top allies in Congress sought to drill down on these allegations. They asked questions focused on an incident at Twitter last year when the company said it accidentally limited the visibility of four Republican members of Congress -- including Meadows and the panel's ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio) -- in its search results. When users typed their names into Twitter, they did not auto-populate, according to reporting from Vice News.</p><p>Kevin Kane, Twitter's public policy manager, said the company made a mistake, which it quickly fixed and publicly explained. But the members pressed him on why it appeared only Republican members of Congress were impacted by the mistake.\u00a0</p><p>Democrats have largely brushed off Republicans' accusations of bias against conservatives, but in a rare display of bipartisanship, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the chairman of the subcommittee hosting the hearing, warned the companies that he found the Republicans' accusations concerning.\u00a0</p><p> \"That worries me,\" Lynch said. \"Certainly I probably didn't agree with anything those members were ... but still it is free speech. Right now we have 257 million Americans with smart phones and everyone is mobile right now, so the scale of what can happen if you make a mistake as you've conceded is enormous so that cannot happen, that cannot happen. Especially in the campaign context, that hurts our credebility as well.\"\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Both Republicans and Democrats blasted facial recogntion at a Congressional hearing yesterday, raising concerns that the artificial intelligence software could pose a threat to Americans' privacy and civil rights,my colleague Drew Harwell reports.\u00a0          </p><p>Members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee slammed the largely unregulated technology as inaccurate and invasive, and several raised the prospect of passing a federal law regulating the technology that is growing in popularity with law enforcement. Some members even raised concerns about whether the technology could be used by the U.S. government as it is in China to exert social control.\u00a0</p><p>Committee chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said there's a consensus among lawmakers that they should crackdown on the technology. \"The question, he said, is whether the systems should face a moratorium while the technology is assessed or refined, or whether it should banned outright,\" Drew wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon shareholders voted on two facial recognition proposals yesterday -- including a sales ban on the technology that The Technology 202 covered yesterday. Both of the proposals failed. However the breakdown of the votes has not yet been released, and if shareholders got at least 3 percent of the votes, they could bring forward the proposals again in the future.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai signaled he would greenlight the deal following those concessions earlier this week.\u00a0</p><p>While Justice Department staff has made this recommendation, it's not a final decision.\u00a0DOJ's top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, will make the final call. A spokesman for DOJ declined to comment to Tony.\u00a0</p><p> \"A lawsuit to block the merger - if it is brought - would mark a rare break within the government's own ranks,\" Tony writes.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Huawei holds a measly 0.03 percent of the U.S. market for handset sales. But abroad it's a phone-making juggernaut that was on track to surpass Apple as the second-largest phone maker in the world before the Trump administration took aggressive actions against the company in recent weeks, my colleague Greg Bensinger writes.\u00a0</p><p>Many American's aren't even familiar with the company in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, largely due to a decade-long rift with the U.S. Greg writes the allegations against the company sound \"straight out of a James Bond film\" and include\u00a0espionage, trade violations and intellectual property theft.\u00a0</p><p>Brittney Jones, a 27-year-old Olympia, Wash., resident is one of the small minority of Americans who prefers Huawei phones. She said she's never met another American who owns a Huawei phone, except for the man she bought her own handset from on Craigslist. She preferred the device due to its front-facing camera.\u00a0</p><p>\"I didn't really care what the name was,\" Jones, a student, who researched the phone online, told Greg. \"It's not fair that we don't have access to the best technologies in the U.S. I should be able to just go to the store and buy the best phone out there.\"</p><p>             -- Tech news from the private sector:          </p><p>             -- Tech news from the public sector:          </p><p>             -- Tech news generating buzz online:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-bb5ed809dfd643469cfef3a93289c95d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5S-VH41-JB4M-V3BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1314\"/><timeReceived>12:49 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) wrote a letter yesterday to Attorney General William Barr, seeking a Justice Department investigation into whether Mark Zuckerberg lied in his 2018 testimony when he said that Facebook doesn't make content decisions based on political ideology.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The fact that Gaetz is putting a fresh spotlight on those more than two-year-old comments as the tech titan is about to testify suggests that the issue could resurface at the hearing before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing, on which Gaetz sits.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"As a member of this body, I question Mr. Zuckerberg's veracity, and challenge his willingness to cooperate with our oversight authority, diverting congressional resources during time-sensitive investigations, and materially impeding our work,\" Gaetz said in the letter.          </p><p>And Trump himself is adding to the drumbeat of anticonservative bias claims, suggesting in a tweet last night with no evidence that Twitter is seeking out bad reports about him to feature in its \"Trending\" section. The president went so far as to call the feature, which ranks frequently shared tweets on the service, \"illegal.\"          </p><p>             The hearing with the chiefs of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google is the culmination of a more than year-long investigation into the power of tech titans.          </p><p>             Yet Democrats and tech policy experts warned that anticonservative bias claims could distract from those issues in the rare hearing, in which lawmakers will have a limited window of time to press four of the wealthiest and most powerful industry leaders in the United States. (Amazon's chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)          </p><p>Many consumer advocates and Democrats hope tomorrow's hearing can set the stage for an overhaul of outdated antitrust laws, which are difficult to apply to competition in issues in the tech industry. But if lawmakers remain focused on the divisive - and flashier - issue of content moderation, it could be challenging to reach that consensus.</p><p>             \"The success of this hearing depends on having a laser-like focus on the power of these companies, how they act anticompetitively, what their impact is on democracy,\" said Gigi Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law &amp; Policy. \"If the hearing goes off in too many different directions ... then it just becomes very confusing.\"          </p><p>             Gaetz's claim, for instance, relies on limited evidence from a controversial source. Gaetz's letter cites a video suggesting Facebook content moderators are more likely to filter content supporting Trump and other Republicans created by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that targets reporters, tech workers and others it deems to be left-leaning. The organization is known for releasing highly edited videos of its subjects that are widely criticized as being inaccurate. The footage has not been substantiated by The Post or other major news outlets. Project Veritas CEO James O'Keefe said, \"Not a single one of our videos has been proven to be deceptively edited or taken out of context.\"</p><p>Facebook didn't respond to a request for comment on the Gaetz letter, but it has repeatedly denied that its moderation decisions are biased against political ideologies.          </p><p>             \"If a platform is dominant in the marketplace and is discriminating against a particular political point of view, [then] anti-competitive behavior coupled with bias is concerning,\" Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), a member of the antitrust panel, recently told our colleague Tony Romm.          </p><p>Twitter, whose chief will not be present tomorrow, may still be a topic of conversation. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, recently tried to draw these issues into tomorrow's antitrust hearing by sending a letter calling Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey appear. The Democrats running the hearing however did not invite Dorsey, whose company is significantly smaller than the other tech giants facing antitrust scrutiny. Twitter is valued at less than $30 billion, while some of the companies appearing including Amazon, Apple and Google are worth over $1 trillion.          </p><p>Twitter declined to comment on Trump's latest tweet. It's also unclear what law Trump considers Twitter to be breaking.</p><p>From Alex Howard, a director of the digital democracy project at Demand Progress, which has called to break up Facebook:</p><p>             Content moderation issues involving the president's account are only intensifying in the pandemic. Twitter removed several tweets that Trump shared overnight that made false claims about the coronavirus pandemic, including a viral video showing a group of doctors making misleading and false claims about the pandemic, my colleague Katie Shepard reports. Facebook and YouTube also removed copies of the video. Twitter also added a note to its trending topics warning about the potential risks of hydroxychloroquine use, as Trump shared more than 14 tweets over a half-hour span that promoted the antimalarial treatment and attacked infectious disease expert Anthony S. Fauci.</p><p>             Anticonservative bias claims are fueling a broader push for regulatory crackdown.          </p><p>             The tech industry's prized legal shield, a more than two-decade-old provision known as Section 230, is in jeopardy on multiple fronts.          </p><p>             The Trump administration yesterday formally asked the Federal Communications Commission to start a process to reinterpret essential aspects of the provision, which gives tech companies broad legal immunity for their decisions about content on their services.          </p><p>             \"Unfortunately, large online platforms appear to engage in selective censorship that is harming our national discourse,\" the petition says. \"The FCC should determine how Section 230 can best serve its goals of promoting internet diversity and a free flow of ideas, as well as holding dominant platforms accountable for their editorial decisions, in new market conditions and technologies that have emerged since the 1990s.\"          </p><p>             Senate lawmakers will also hold a hearing today on the PACT Act, a bipartisan proposal that would ensure companies be more transparent about their content moderation decisions. Republicans working on the bill have suggested that it would address some of the concerns on the right because it would allow users to appeal companies' takedown decisions.          </p><p>             Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also is unveiling new legislation today that would bring changes to Section 230 by revoking the immunity for tech companies that display targeted              ads based on information about consumers' browsing behavior.              He's also introduced other proposals to upend the legal shield in response to his concerns of anti-conservative bias.          </p><p>             Update: After publication, Project Veritas disputed the characterization of their videos in this article and provided an on-the-record comment, which has been added.          </p><p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton requested information related to a lawsuit Facebook recently settled in Illinois over alleged biometric privacy law violations, Ashley Gold at Axios reports. The Illinois case argued that Facebook violated the law by using facial recognition to automatically suggest users to tag in photos. The company discontinued the tool last year.</p><p>But Facebook has been reluctant to turn information from the case over.</p><p>The attorney general pushed the company in June to explain why it wouldn't turn over the requested material, according to public records obtained by the Tech Transparency Project, a research initiative of nonprofit Campaign for Accountability that investigates Big Tech. Paxton's office said at the time that only Texas was involved in the inquiry. Paxton's office is also leading a multistate investigation into Google and is part of a multistate antitrust investigation into Facebook led by the New York Attorney General.</p><p>Texas and Illinois are two of the three U.S. states that have biometric privacy protection laws.</p><p>The investigations, by multiple state agencies and the California attorney general, follow a June lawsuit from a San Francisco warehouse worker alleging that the company has put its workers at \"needless risk,\" Diane Bartz and Paresh Dave at Reuters reports.</p><p>California is the second state after New York to launch a probe into Amazon's behavior during the coronavirus pandemic. New York State Attorney General Letitia James also launched an investigation in the company, writing in an April letter that her office had concerns that the company's response to the pandemic was inadequate and possibly in violation of labor laws. Amazon has refused to disclose the number of its workers nationally to test positive for covid-19.</p><p>The June California lawsuit asked for an injunctive order to shut down a San Francisco Amazon warehouse, citing unsafe practices including failing to allow for proper social distancing.

But the companies' antitrust scrutiny may be about to get worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's because lawmakers on the House Judiciary antitrust panel came heavily stocked with new evidence from their year-long investigation into the tech industry's power, which has amassed 1 million documents from the companies and hundreds of hours of interviews with industry insiders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lawmakers unveiled executives' own words, recordings of conversations with small businesses and a trove of other evidence at the hearing to bolster accusations that tech companies squash their competitors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             The investigation could have an enduring impact on how the world regulates the tech industry. The revelations come at a critical moment, as tech companies face antitrust probes both in the United States and Europe - and U.S. lawmakers seek to overhaul existing antitrust laws they say are outdated and ill-equipped to rein in tech companies today.          </p><p>             Here were some critical findings you probably will hear about again:          </p><p>Emails, chat records and video recordings - including some remarks and messages directly from Zuckerberg himself - were key to the committee's accusations that Facebook engaged in anti-competitive behavior. They accused the company of harvesting data about how its users behaved on other consumer apps, and then used that data to \"copy, acquire, and kill\" any rivals they notice have traction.</p><p>Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, brought up a 2012 statements in which Zuckerberg apparently said he sought to acquire Instagram, which at the time was a rival photo-sharing app, out of fear that it could hurt Facebook.           </p><p>Zuckerberg, in response, said: \"By having them join us, they certainly went from being a competitor in the space of mobile cameras, to an app that we could continue to help grow and help get more people to be able to use and be on our team.\" Zuckerberg argued it was far from obvious at the time of the acquisition that Instagram would reach the scale it had today.</p><p>But Nadler argued that if Facebook did snap up the company to neutralize a competitive threat, it would be against antitrust law. He pressed Zuckerberg on whether the company should be broken up.</p><p>Kevin Systrom's chat logs show he worried about how Facebook might retaliate if he decided not to sell after Zuckerberg expressed interest in buying the photo-sharing app in 2012.</p><p>\"Will [Zuckerberg] go into destroy mode if I say no [to an acquisition deal]?\" Systrom asked in a message to tech investor Matt Cohler, according to documents published by the committee.</p><p>\"Probably,\" replied Cohler, who had been an early Facebook employee. He warned that Facebook might target the app more aggressively if its leaders knew Instagram was raising more funding from venture capitalists.</p><p>These chat records were key to the interrogation by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) of Zuckerberg, in which she pressed him on whether he copied competitors. Watch here:</p><p>Rep. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) sought to highlight the personal toll of the companies' policies when she confronted Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos with a recording of a third-party seller who said she was restricted because she competed with the e-commerce giant in selling textbooks. The small business owner, in the recording played during the hearing, accused Amazon of systematically blocking her company from selling textbooks for months, after her business began to cut into Amazon's market share. She insisted the restrictions put her business and ability to feed her family in jeopardy, and that she heard no response when attempting to contact the company to get them lifted. (Bezos also owns the Washington Post).</p><p>Here's the exchange, captured by The Guardian:</p><p>Bezos said it was not an acceptable way to treat a partner, but he wasn't aware of a specific case. \"I appreciate that you showed me that anecdote, and I would like to talk to her,\" Bezos said. \"It does not at all, to me, seem like the right way to treat her.\"</p><p>Lawmakers sought to make the case that this was not a unique experience. \"We have heard so many heartbreaking stories of small businesses who sunk significant time and resources into building a business and selling on Amazon, only to have Amazon poach their best-selling items and drive them out of business,\" said David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who chairs the subcommittee that hosted the hearing.</p><p>Bezos also was also pressed by the committee on reports and supporting interviews by congressional investigators that found Amazon employees used data collected from third-party merchants to develop its own competing products. The e-commerce titan testified that he couldn't guarantee that the company didn't use proprietary data for this purpose, my colleague Jay Greene wrote. Bezos said the company had a policy against that practice, but it is currently investigating whether those rules had ever been violated.</p><p>Apple executive Eddy Cue once suggested raising the cut Apple would take from subscriptions to apps on its App Store to 40 percent, up from the 30 percent the company initially charged. The committee shared the finding on Twitter:</p><p>Cook insisted the company has never increased its commission fees, as lawmakers pressed him on whether the Apple App Store was too powerful and took too much of a tax from developers. But lawmakers questioned whether the company could do so in the future. Cook said that there was strong competition for app developers that would influence Apple's pricing.</p><p>Yet the document was key reveal because it highlighted that there has not always been a consensus about this issue among Apple's top leaders.</p><p>             Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) grilled Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google and its parent company Alphabet, about the company's practice of combining user data from its services with that from DoubleClick, an advertising company that the search giant acquired in 2007.          </p><p>Google had previously told Congress it wouldn't combine data, Demings said. But then the company did so in 2016. Pichai confirmed that he signed off on the decision.          </p><p>             \"Practically, this decision meant that your company would now combine all of my data on Google, my search history, my information from Google maps, information from my email, my Gmail, as well as my personal identity with the record of almost all of the websites I visited,\" Demings said. \"That is absolutely staggering.\"          </p><p>Cicilline accused all four companies of wielding monopoly power at the conclusion of his remarks, and he suggested some need to be broken up. He made clear a broader regulatory crackdown is coming for all of them.</p><p>That could start in about a month, when the committee is expected to issue a wide-ranging report on the findings of its investigation.</p><p>Cicilline told me after the hearing he thought the tech executives' testimony supported many of the findings of the lengthy investigation. \"They're engaged in behavior that's anticompetitive, which favors their own products and services, which monetizes and weaponizes data, which compromises the privacy of their users and which creates a competitive disadvantage for companies attempting to enter the marketplace,\" he said as reporters gathered around him on the Hill.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Republicans get on board with the Democrats' plans. Though the investigation began as a bipartisan endeavor, significant partisan divisions have broken out. The panel's top Republican, Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), said he didn't think it was time to overhaul antitrust laws, but rather to examine how the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department are enforcing the rules already on the books.</p><p>             Programming note: The Technology 202 will not publish on Friday, July 31. I'll be on vacation next week, but the newsletter will be back in your inbox with a great lineup of guest hosts.          </p><p>\"I'll just cut to the chase. Big Tech is out to get conservatives,\" Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said in his opening remarks.</p><p>It was a major theme of the hearing as Republicans lobbed attacks against Facebook and Google for engaging in perceived political censorship against conservatives. The industry has vehemently denied such charges.          </p><p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked Zuckerberg about specific incidents in which Facebook executives allegedly may have played down conservative viewpoints, Elizabeth Dwoskin reports.</p><p>Gaetz asked whether content moderators and other employees were ever fired because of their policies. Gaetz cited documents from former right-leaning Facebook executive and Oculus creator Palmer Luckey that suggested the company asked him to suppress his political beliefs.</p><p>Zuckerberg wouldn't comment on Luckey but said firing someone for political beliefs would be inappropriate.</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai defended his company's search tool against claims of bias against conservatives, Rachel Lerman reports.</p><p>Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.) alleged that Google had removed a conservative site from the search results and only stored it before the hearing. Pichai said he would look into the specific issue but said, \"We approach our work with a deep sense of responsibility in a nonpartisan way.\"</p><p>Steube also suggested that Google might intentionally mark conservative emails as spam. \"There's nothing in the algorithm which has anything to do with political ideology,\" Pichai said.</p><p>Democrats derided Republicans' allegations. Rep. Jaime Raskin (D-Md.) accused his conservative colleagues of having a \"persecution complex.\"</p><p>Both had plants that elevated their otherwise modest Web camera backgrounds, style columnist Robin Givhan writes. Zuckerberg on the other hand \"looked as though he were delivering his testimony from the interior of a nuclear reactor.\"          </p><p>But it was Pichai who won the best-dressed. Robin writes:</p><p>\"Google's Sundar Pichai was the sleekest of the lot in both appearance and setting. He wore an elegant charcoal suit and matching tie and was well-framed behind a desk that sat in an office that looked like it had been inspired by the West Elm catalogue. He sat with perfect posture, and when he spoke, his gestures were emotive but not frantic. He tended to steeple his fingers as he attempted to answer the House Judiciary subcommittee members' meandering questions that teetered between privacy issues and conspiracy theories.\"</p><p>Givhan also captured some of the fireworks of the hearing that resulted from Jordan's outburst over alleged conservative bias: \"So he started yelling again. And he was told to put on his mask. And, well, oh, boy, it was as childish as it all sounds, and one couldn't help but wonder whether some of our representatives are drinking the hand sanitizer instead of using it for good hygiene.\"</p><p>It's just one of the \"big little lies\" tech executives gave at the hearing, columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler says.</p><p>For instance, both Pichai and Zuckerberg claimed that users were in control of their data. When Demings questioned Pichai over the company's decision to combine its existing trove of data with the data of another ad network it acquired, Pichai said consumers benefited from simpler control settings. But Geoffrey points out that more control settings don't always mean ones that are easy for consumers to use. And Pichai evaded the question of whether more data helped Google profit. </p><p>Cook also made the argument that Apple's iPhone gives users and developers more choice. But the company has also made it difficult for users to switch over to Android, Geoffrey notes. </p><p>Tech companies also argued that they aren't too big. Bezos rebutted monopoly allegations by pointing out Amazon makes up less than 4 percent of U.S. retail. But Amazon accounts for nearly 40 percent of online shopping, which has become ever more profitable during the pandemic, as Geoffrey notes.</p><p>The bottom line: \"It is effectively impossible to use the Internet without using in one way or another the services of these four companies,\" Nadler said in his opening remarks.</p><p>It may have been Bezos's first hearing, but he came prepared.

The president recently threatened to ban the app over similar concerns.          </p><p>             TikTok is trying to allay concerns by opening up its computer code for U.S. regulators and privacy experts to probe for anything improper,              Tony Romm reports             .          </p><p>Top facial recognition tech is thrown off by masks, study says, but that could soon change (Taylor Telford)</p><p>Madonna keeps making controversial covid-19 claims, calling a misinformation-spreading doctor her 'hero' (Travis Andrews)</p><p>Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook will all release their quarterly earnings today.</p><p>             RightsCon will take place online on July 27-31.          </p><p>No good pandemic-era hearing is complete without a blooper reel of tech glitches.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) would call that a missed opportunity.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The congressman who represents Silicon Valley wants his party to counter Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" message with an ambitious pitch to bring modern jobs to heartland cities and rural areas that have been left behind in the recent tech boom.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Trump's telling these folks he's going to bring them back to the past,\" Khanna said in an interview yesterday ahead of the Democratic primary debate in South Carolina. \"That's not a realistic vision. But what they sense is, 'At least Trump understands our anxiety, and he's speaking to us and he cares.' And I think what we have to say is, 'We understand your anxiety and appreciate it, too.'\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's unlikely Khanna's proposal for a new jobs package - a $900 billion plan to jump-start new tech hubs through federal research and development and a nationwide expansion of computer science education - will move through a gridlocked Congress, given its hefty price tag. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             But the big-picture message of investing in tech and other innovation in the heartland is timely as Democrats seek ways to win battleground states they             ceded to Trump with razor-thin margins             in 2016, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. \u00a0          </p><p>             As Democrats more broadly continue their attacks on Big Tech, this proposal is one that's likely to appeal to companies as well. \u00a0          </p><p>Start-ups are struggling to keep up with the high cost of living and competition for salaries in the Bay Area. Even large tech companies such as Amazon and Apple have sought to expand outside of major tech hubs such as San Francisco and Seattle as costs soar. \u00a0</p><p>Khanna thinks the main barrier holding companies back from expanding to smaller cities or rural areas is a lack of talent that's ready and able to serve a company's needs. \u00a0</p><p>\"These companies should expand their imagination about where they can look,\" he said. \"But we have to, as a government at the state and federal level, provide investments in collaboration with private sector and the workforce that will that will attract them.\"</p><p>The most high-profile example was Amazon's HQ2 contest, the e-commerce giant's search for a second headquarters location. The company ultimately decided to open its second headquarters in Northern Virginia, after the state showered it with tax incentives. Amazon pulled back on plans to split HQ2 between Virginia and New York, following broad backlash in the latter state to giving the tech giant big tax incentives.\u00a0</p><p>But Khanna says it was a \"missed opportunity\" for the company not to go with a location in a more rural area or with a more diverse population.\u00a0</p><p>\"Imagine if they put that in Nebraska or in parts of Mississippi,\" Khanna said.\" They would say, well, this is very difficult because the infrastructure of the workplace isn't there. But maybe they could partner with the state and federal government to help create that workforce.\" (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Washington Post). \u00a0</p><p>As the New York debacle over HQ2 underscored, there's some resistance to giving rich tech companies major incentives funded by taxpayers for expansions. But Khanna says the Democrats' pitch can't just be about expanding traditional software development jobs throughout the country - it has to be regionally specific. He said that could mean investing in advanced manufacturing in Youngstown, Ohio, or \"Timber 2.0\" in Spokane, Washington.</p><p>\"The idea of plopping Silicon Valley everywhere, which is kind of I think how it gets caricatured that everyone should be a coder, is not is not the vision of how do we prepare America for a 21st century economy,\" he said. \u00a0</p><p>Khanna's plan would also establish a Federal Institute of Technology, which would be tasked with promoting breakthrough science. The FIT would be responsible for picking the tech hubs, through an open competition. The goal is to establish 30 such hubs around the country over a ten-year period. Funding would be dedicated to research and development in areas such as artificial intelligence, computer hardware, advanced manufacturing and climate-related technologies. \u00a0</p><p>His proposal would also effectively require computer science to be part of the base curriculum for students in grades K through 12 nationwide. It would make it a subject for which states are required to create standards, as is the case now with reading, mathematics and science.\u00a0</p><p>His plan also includes tax incentives for companies to hire disadvantaged rural and minority workers. \u00a0</p><p>Khanna says that this level of investment is not needed just to expand access to modern jobs throughout the country, but also to keep pace with rivals. He says a $900 billion investment over ten years would raise total public R &amp; D spending to 1 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the period. \u00a0</p><p>\"In the Cold War was 3 percent,\" he said. \"So if we want to stay ahead of China, we need to be winning in these new technologies.\"\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>Last night Twitter partnered with CBS News to livestream the Democratic Debate in South Carolina.

Ron Wyden\u00a0(Ore.) wants to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee said Congress has a responsibility to act when companies \"repeatedly lie\" about\u00a0 how they use consumers' data such as messages,\u00a0 location and other information\u00a0on their sweeping platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wyden told me in an interview yesterday that he\u00a0believes that Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg weren't entirely truthful in their statements to Congress in which they argued\u00a0consumers are in the driver's seat when it comes to\u00a0controlling how their data is used and who has access to it.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Practically every week something comes out that indicates otherwise,\" Wyden said. Zuckerberg is\u00a0\"racking up the Pinocchios.\"          </p><p>The senator was referring to new revelations in a Tuesday New York Times report\u00a0revealing Facebook has struck deals to share users' personal data with dozens of other technology companies, giving these partners much broader access than the company has\u00a0publicly disclosed. Facebook never\u00a0sold user data, but it did benefit\u00a0from the arrangements because they helped the social media giant\u00a0bring in new users and drive up advertising revenue. The company put out a lengthy defense of its partnerships with third parties yesterday.</p><p>Wyden wants Zuckerberg and Sandberg to come back to testify on Capitol Hill. He criticized Sandberg for not telling Americans what information Facebook shares with companies that have strong ties to China and Russia when he pressed her on it during a hearing this year. The Times detailed that Facebook's sharing arrangements included the Chinese company Huawei and the Russian search company Yandex,\u00a0 raising security concerns.</p><p>\"I don't believe Congress and the American people got straight answers,\" Wyden said about Sandberg's testimony before the Senate\u00a0Intelligence Committee on Facebook's dealings with companies tied to foreign adversaries.</p><p>Wyden has long been one of the most ardent privacy advocates in Congress, and as Democrats eye a comprehensive national privacy law in 2019, the Democrat\u00a0is pushing for a bill including\u00a0\"serious penalties,\" possibly even the prospect of jail time, for chief executives caught\u00a0lying to the federal government about their privacy policies.</p><p>Lying to Congress is\u00a0a federal crime, as the Michael Cohen case recently illustrated. But Wyden says the country needs a law that explicitly spells that out because Cohen's guilt plea marked\u00a0the\u00a0rare case\u00a0 in which perjury before lawmakers\u00a0was prosecuted given the special circumstances surrounding\u00a0special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into Russian election interference.</p><p>The senator\u00a0compared misleading statements by tech executives\u00a0about privacy issues to an incident earlier in his career, when he pressed tobacco executives under oath on whether nicotine was addictive.</p><p>They all said no - even though internal company information proved otherwise, Wyden said. Even though the incident was referred to the Justice Department, statutes of limitations and the difficulty of such a prosecution resulted in lack of legal action. </p><p>In another instance, Wyden\u00a0asked former director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. whether the government was collecting data on millions of Americans. Clapper said no, an inaccurate statement\u00a0later exposed by the Edward Snowden revelations. Clapper was also never prosecuted in that example.</p><p>Passing tough privacy\u00a0legislation will be no easy task in next year's divided Congress. Though there is bipartisan interest in establishing\u00a0a national privacy law, it remains to be seen whether the two parties can reach consensus on tough penalties.</p><p>Many Democrats blasted Facebook on Wednesday in the wake of the New York Times report. Republicans were not as harsh in their criticism, but Senate Commerce Committee\u00a0John Thune (R-S.D.) and\u00a0 second-ranking Republican Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.) said the reports underscore the need for a national privacy law.</p><p>             \"I anticipate this will be a major focus during the next Congress,\" Wicker told me in a statement.          </p><p>To Wyden, a tough law is a matter of national security, and the only way to break the cycle of companies offering insincere \"face-saving\" exercises instead of meaningful change in the wake of the controversies.</p><p>One of the key questions following the Times's report on Facebook's data partnerships is whether the company violated a 2011 consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, which required Facebook to disclose its data practices more transparently to users. Facebook denies that these partnerships violated the consent decree.</p><p>The Times reported that four former FTC officials and employees briefed on its findings \"said the data-sharing deals likely violated the consent agreement.\"</p><p>\"Facebook may be in some really hot water here,\" Wyden said.</p><p>Wyden's bill aims to give greater powers to the Federal Trade Commission, which seems to sorely need them.</p><p>The attorney general for the District of Columbia on Wednesday brought the first U.S. lawsuit against Facebook in connection to the Cambridge Analytica scandal,\u00a0 when a whistleblower came forward nine\u00a0months ago to sound the alarm that the company allowed third parties to improperly access users data.</p><p>My\u00a0colleagues Tony Romm, Brian Fung, Aaron C. Davis and Craig Timberg reported that some privacy advocates were concerned\u00a0that the action was taken by a local official and not the\u00a0federal government's top privacy cop. They're worried about the agency's track record and lack of firepower at a time when lawmakers and the general public are ratcheting up pressure for regulators to do more.\u00a0</p><p>Wyden believes the FTC is woefully understaffed and inadequately resourced to take on Big Tech.</p><p>\"It'd be like going up against an NBA all-star team with a few people who got some JV time,\" Wyden said.</p><p>Wyden still has more questions for Facebook after reading the Times report, especially about\u00a0the revelation that Facebook allowed Netflix and Spotify to read users' messages.</p><p>\"I think users really deserve to know how their data is being used,\" Wyden said. \"I don't think Mark Zuckerberg ever said anything resembling, 'Hey, Facebook is allowing Spotify and Netflix to read user messages.' \"</p><p>Facebook shared more details about its messaging partnerships Wednesday, saying that its partners could only access users' messages if they used Facebook Login.\u00a0Facebook said it publicly disclosed the practice, linking to this 2014 article\u00a0describing\u00a0how users could send Facebook messages through Netflix. The article does not describe the scope of message data Netflix received from Facebook, or mention the word \"privacy.\"\u00a0A Netflix spokeswoman said the partnership was one of the company's experiments to make Netflix more social\u00a0and it was never very popular so it shut down in 2015.</p><p> \"At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook, or ask for the ability to do so,\" she said in a statement.\u00a0</p><p>             Dear Readers: The Technology 202 is taking a break for the holidays starting on Monday, Dec. 24.

Karl A. Racine, the attorney general for the District of Columbia, \"targeted Facebook mainly for its entanglement\" with the political consultancy that gathered vast amounts of data about tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent, The Washington Post's Tony, Brian, Aaron\u00a0and Craig reported.</p><p>Racine said in a statement\u00a0that the company \"failed to protect\" its users' privacy and misled them about how their data was used. \"Facebook put users at risk of manipulation by allowing companies like Cambridge Analytica and other third-party applications to collect personal data without users' permission,\" Racine said.\u00a0\"Today's lawsuit is about making Facebook live up to its promise to protect its users' privacy.\"</p><p>             Officials also said\u00a0additional charges could be added to the lawsuit if more allegations about Facebook's data collection practices emerge, according to my colleagues. Racine said that although there is no multistate lawsuit against Facebook, his team has\u00a0\"had discussions with a number of other states that are similarly interested in protecting the data and personal information of their consumers.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Local officials have offered tech giants like Amazon and Apple tax incentives\u00a0to expand their offices beyond their West Coast headquarters.\u00a0But some experts say those perks don't actually play a fundamental role in a company's decision to expand, Wired's Paris Martineau reported.\u00a0</p><p>Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, said\u00a0labor costs, raw materials, transportation and other factors weigh more heavily when companies choose a location.\u00a0\"The trouble is we've had this system created in America that allows companies to control the narrative, and get paid to do what they would have done anyway based on the business basics,\" LeRoy\u00a0told Wired. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>             Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that Apple, which recently announced a new campus in Austin, would probably have decided to expand in the area regardless of incentives. Austin already has the largest number of Apple employees outside Silicon Valley.\u00a0\"Apple has grown by thousands in recent years,\" Jensen told Wired. \"And now they are getting a new abatement to grow by a few thousand more.\"</p><p>             BYTES: Third-party sellers on Amazon are turning to unforgiving tactics\u00a0 s they compete against one other - even framing other businesses to get them suspended, according to the Verge's\u00a0Josh Dzieza.\u00a0One strategy is to purchase fake reviews for a competitor. \"A handful of glowing testimonials, preferably in broken English about unrelated products and written by a known review purveyor on Fiverr, can not only take out a competitor and allow you to move up a slot in Amazon's search results, it can land your rival in the bewildering morass of Amazon's suspension system,\" the Verge reported.</p><p>A new industry has emerged as a result: People whose businesses have been suspended can hire consultants\u00a0to appeal the decision. \"They are like lawyers, only their legal code is the Amazon Terms of Service, their court is a secretive and semiautomated corporate bureaucracy, and their jurisdiction is an algorithmically policed global bazaar rife with devious plots to hijack listings for novelty socks and plastic watches,\"\u00a0Dzieza\u00a0reported.</p><p>             - Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, or PIF, and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co., which are key investors in\u00a0SoftBank's\u00a0tech fund, aren't so sure that a plan to invest $16 billion\u00a0in WeWork is the right way to go, the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Liz Hoffman, Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell reported, citing people familiar with the matter. \"Some of the people said that PIF and Mubadala have questioned the wisdom of doubling down on WeWork, and have cast doubt on its rich valuation,\" according to the Journal. \"The company is on track to lose around $2 billion this year, and the funds have expressed concern that WeWork's model could leave it exposed if the economy turns down, some of the people said.\"</p><p>             - Matt Chasen hopes that the\u00a0Hexa, which my colleague Peter Holley described as\u00a0an \"electric-powered vertical-takeoff-and-landing aircraft,\" will one day help\u00a0remedy traffic congestion by letting people ride in air taxis. Chasen, who is the\u00a0chief executive of LIFT Aircraft and a former Boeing engineer, said he thinks commuters will eventually be drawn to the idea of riding in such aircraft. \"Today's regulatory environment does not allow for a transportation use of these aircraft - yet,\"\u00a0Chasen\u00a0told my colleague. \"We'll build public trust in the technology. Once that happens, it's inevitable that people will want to use it for certain types of commuting flights.\"</p><p>             -\u00a0Lighthouse, a start-up making security cameras equipped with artificial intelligence features, is closing shop, according to the Verge's\u00a0Nick Statt. The company had to contend\u00a0with much larger competitors such as Google and Amazon.\u00a0\"I am incredibly proud of the groundbreaking work the Lighthouse team accomplished - delivering useful and accessible intelligence for our homes via advanced AI and 3D sensing,\" Lighthouse chief executive\u00a0Alex Teichman\u00a0said in a statement on the company's website.\u00a0\"Unfortunately, we did not achieve the commercial success we were looking for and will be shutting down operations in the near future.\"          </p><p>             - More technology news about the private sector:          </p><p>             - Chinese authorities control\u00a0content that users post on WeChat\u00a0and other platforms\u00a0and censor\u00a0what they deem out of bounds, but at the moment Beijing seems to be making an exception when it comes to criticism of the Trump administration, according to BuzzFeed News's\u00a0Craig Silverman,\u00a0Megha Rajagopalan,\u00a0Scott Pham and\u00a0William Yang.

As companies such as Amazon and Google are battered with antitrust investigations and privacy mishaps, Microsoft can avoid playing defense - and make a positive pitch to work with government.\u00a0(Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>             Nadella also made clear that Microsoft is\u00a0doubling down on trying to do business with the federal government after tech companies have faced backlash for working with the military and Trump administration.\u00a0          </p><p>\"We want to partner with government - not to be dependent on us from a technology standpoint, but to become independent users and builders of technology, working together with us,\" he will say.\u00a0</p><p>             Nadella will highlight Microsoft's commitment to building \"responsible\" artificial intelligence, as the government turns to Big Tech to\u00a0keep up with\u00a0the latest in AI and cloud computing. \"We believe in responsible AI, and ask the tough questions, like not just what computers can do but what they should do,\" Nadella will say.\u00a0</p><p>             Nadella's sales pitch\u00a0represents a very different tack from that of Google, which dropped a key artificial intelligence contract with the Pentagon\u00a0last year after employees protested\u00a0due to concerns that the technology they built would be used for warfare. Google also backed off from bidding for a major government cloud computing contract, known as Project JEDI.\u00a0</p><p>But while Google has moved to the sidelines, Amazon and Microsoft have increasingly been trying to make inroads with government agencies. Earlier this year, Microsoft secured a $7.6 billion deal to build software for the Pentagon. They companies also are the two finalists for the Pentagon's $10 billion cloud-computing Pentagon contract,\u00a0known as Project Jedi. The Pentagon pressed\u00a0pause on the contract this summer amid concerns that Amazon was receiving favoritism from the department.</p><p>             Nadella today will highlight the many ways that the U.S. military is already using Microsoft technology. Here are some of the example examples he'll cite:</p><p>             In the prepared remarks, Nadella notably steered clear of more controversial applications of Microsoft's tech, such as how it could be deployed in battlefield settings or used to support the Trump administration's immigration policies. Microsoft had its own employee protests last year when employees demanded that the company cut ties with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in protest of the Trump administration's policies at the border. Nadella wrote an internal memo to employees where he said the company's contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement supported \"legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads,\" not any projects related to separation of migrant families.</p><p>             Today's summit marks Nadella's first trip to Washington since early 2019. Izzy Santa, a company spokeswoman, tells me he will not be meeting with lawmakers or the White House - which is also a different approach than other\u00a0tech executives took in recent visits. Nadella met with Veterans Affairs\u00a0officials at Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center\u00a0yesterday to show how an Xbox controller could be used to help veterans with therapy.\u00a0</p><p>             Correction:\u00a0A previous version of this article incorrectly said that Nadella visited MedStar Washington Hospital Center yesterday. Nadella was at Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center.          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is calling on Congress and state authorities to scrutinize how Facebook handles politicians' content.          </p><p>          Warren is calling for hearings and investigations as she raises\u00a0concerns that Facebook is allowing President Trump to run ads containing information that is \"obviously untrue.\"\u00a0       </p><p>          Warren is calling out Trump's ads just two weeks after Facebook announced it would not send ads from politicians' to its third-party fact-checking partners.\u00a0Warren noted that Trump and Zuckerberg recently met at the Oval Office and questioned what happened during that meeting. She also said that Trump has been a large spender on Facebook ads, spending over a million dollars a week.       </p><p>Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Warren's tweets. Warren's comments are just the latest in an escalating feud between the lawmaker and the tech giant. Warren has long called to break up Facebook and other big tech companies, putting her at odds with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. A report last week that Zuckerberg called Warren an \"existential threat\" to the company have accelerated those tensions.       </p><p>Warren also criticized Facebook for not doing enough to address election interference during the 2016 election, and she raised concerns that the company remains unprepared for 2020.</p><p>             NIBBLES: A bipartisan group of roughly 40 states attorneys general will join an antitrust investigation into Facebook led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The wide support for the probe illustrates a growing concern from regulators that Facebook may engage in anticompetitive behavior that undermines its rivals.\u00a0          </p><p>James also met with officials from the Federal Trade Commisssion and the Department of Justice yesterday, which are conducting their own probes into Facebook's competition practices, as Margaret Harding McGill\u00a0first reported yesterday in Axios. Axios reported that James and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general were expected to meet with\u00a0Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Associate Attorney General for antitrust Makan Delrahim.\u00a0</p><p>The new details highlight how the investigation into Facebook has expanded since James first announced the probe alongside seven other states and the District of Columbia last month. More states could join the probe yet,\u00a0Tony reports.</p><p>A spokesperson for James in New York declined to comment. Facebook pointed to a previous statement on the investigation, which said the company\u00a0work constructively with state attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\"</p><p>             BYTES: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a 2018 decision to throw out more than $500 million in damages owed by Apple to the University of Wisconsin for infringing on one of its patents. The win for Apple comes as it endures heavy scrutiny from federal regulators over its business practices.\u00a0</p><p>A licensing body for the University of Wisconsin research first sued Apple in 2014 for allegedly ripping off its processor technology and incorporating it into several iPhone and iPad versions. Apple disputed the claims, but a federal jury slammed Apple with more than\u00a0$243 million in damages - a number it doubled in 2017 after Apple continued to infringe on the patent. But a specialized federal patent court ultimately ruled that Apple could not have infringed on the patent and threw out the damages.</p><p>The University of Wisconsin at Madison's patenting and licensing arm told the Hill that it would continue to pursue damages from Apple.</p><p>             --\u00a0The number of online deepfakes, or videos manipulated with artificial intelligence, has doubled to more than 15,000 in the past seven months -\u00a0and most of them are pornographic, researchers tell Tom Simonite at Wired. The new findings come as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed two laws last week regulating the technology: one that would allow victims of deepfake porn to sue and one that makes it illegal to distribute political deepfakes within 60 days of an election. Free-speech advocates have already criticized the laws.\u00a0</p><p>             More news from the public sector:\u00a0          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p><p>Concerned with safety, some Silicon Valley residents want self-driving cars off of their streets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-a7f72db0be4b4b24ad4961684980b739</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X76-TX51-JB4M-V18K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1584\"/><timeReceived>12:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 8, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As a 2020 presidential contender, she will take that message to the campaign trail.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During a blustery snowstorm on Sunday afternoon, the senator from Minnesota told supporters at a rally announcing her candidacy that it's time for tougher Internet privacy laws -- and slammed\u00a0Big Tech for being too lax with its data practices.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We need to put some digital rules of the road into law when it comes to privacy,\" she said. \"For too long the big tech companies have been telling you: 'Don't worry! We've got your back!' while your identities in fact are being stolen and your data is mined.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Klobuchar also pledged to guarantee net neutrality-- rules that say Internet providers can't block or slow down websites -- and promised to connect every American household to the Internet by 2022.</p><p>             Klobuchar's decision to make privacy and Internet connectivity a central focus of her campaign\u00a0could elevate tech policy issues during the Democratic primary. By touting these issues during her first major speech as a 2020 contender, Klobuchar is making a big bet that privacy and other digital concerns are increasingly important to American voters.          </p><p>It's especially striking since tech policy is not generally an issue that drives\u00a0voters' feet to the polls. In a\u00a0survey about voter priorities ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, Gallup listed health care, the economy and immigration as the top concerns among voters. Technology wasn't even included in the 12 issues on the list.\u00a0Yet i             f Klobuchar shows Democratic voters - especially key demographics like millennials\u00a0- are paying attention, other politicians may start to\u00a0prioritize\u00a0issues like privacy and net neutrality in campaigns.          </p><p>\"Way too many politicians have their heads stuck in the sand when it comes to the digital revolution,\" she said. \"Hey guys, it's not just coming, it's here. And if you don't know the difference between a hack and Slack, it's time to pull off the digital highway.\"</p><p>             Advocates for consumer privacy welcomed Klobuchar's remarks, saying they're a preview of what's to come this election cycle.\u00a0          </p><p>\"Privacy, and more generally regulation of online services, will be top issues in the 2020 election,\" Marc Rotenberg, executive director and president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told me.\u00a0</p><p>Klobuchar's decision to focus on tech issues also caught the attention of many closely following the 2020 race on Twitter.\u00a0Rolling Stone Washington bureau chief Andy\u00a0Kroll said:\u00a0</p><p>Los Angeles\u00a0Times White House reporter Eli Stokols weighed in:\u00a0</p><p>             Americans are eager for change in Silicon Valley-- even if that's not the top issue driving their votes. About half of Americans think technology companies should be regulated more than they are now, according to a study from the Pew Research Center published last year. Focusing on tech in in a campaign could be a\u00a0strategy that\u00a0particularly appeals to Democrats:\u00a057 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaners told Pew that major tech companies should be regulated more.</p><p>             One way Klobuchar could drive her tech-focused pitch\u00a0with voters is by connecting it to her broader economic message. In doing so, she would create a stark contrast from President Trump, whose economic pitch has focused largely on reviving jobs from legacy industries\u00a0such as\u00a0manufacturing. And in another example, Trump\u00a0never said the word \"technology\" in his State of the Union address last week.\u00a0</p><p>In her speech, Klobuchar criticized Washington leaders for sitting on the sidelines as the economy changed and Americans confronted the \"disruptive nature of new technologies.\"\u00a0</p><p> \"For a moment, let's stop seeing those obstacles as obstacles on our path,\" Klobuchar said. \"Let's see those obstacles as our path.\"\u00a0</p><p>             Klobuchar's focus on technology issues could be a strategic decision to highlight the tech-focused legislation she drafted as a senator -- and distinguish herself from other candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. Klobuchar has been able to draft legislation on tech issues with Republicans.\u00a0\u00a0As she makes the case that she's a Midwestern centrist amid a field of progressives, her tech record shows she can work across the aisle.</p><p>This year, she reintroduced a Internet privacy bill called the Social Media Privacy and Consumer Rights Act. Amid a broader push in Congress to pass privacy legislation by the end of this year, it's one of the few bipartisan proposals that has been introduced.</p><p>She also worked with then-Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) to create legislation would force technology companies to be more transparent about who is buying political ads on their platforms. The bill, which was introduced in 2017, stalled in the Senate, but some technology companies like Facebook said they would support it under intense political pressure\u00a0, and the social network introduced new labels for political ads so users could see ad disclosures.\u00a0</p><p>She also was a key sponsor of the bipartisan Secure Elections Act, which aimed to secure the U.S. election system from cyber attacks. The bill gained steam this summer and appeared likely to pass, but it later stalled as negotiations broke down with the White House.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>             She's not the only one bringing tech policy chops to the race, though other Democratic candidates have so far not drilled in on tech policy the same way as Klobuchar in announcing their bids.\u00a0Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) was known for her record on \"revenge porn\" as a California attorney general and a career prosecutor. As a senator, she co-sponsored bipartisan legislation that would make extortion with\u00a0threats to publish explicit images online illegal.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) record of targeting\u00a0powerful corporations could position her as a strong voice on tech policy in the 2020 race. She's said the country needs tougher rules to respond to the massive scale of technology companies like Amazon.\u00a0</p><p>Lesser-known candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., former Maryland congressman John Delaney and business executive Andrew Yang also have tech experience. Buttigieg led his city through a major tech transformation since taking over in 2011, bringing startup opportunities to a town known for manufacturing. Delaney co-founded the House Artificial Intelligence Caucus and has made the future of work key to his campaign. Yang is a former entrepreneur, and he's campaigning on issues related to artificial intelligence.</p><p>These candidates know it's no easy task to appeal to voters on tech issues. Buttigieg says it's all about making it personal and relatable to voters.</p><p>\"We need to make sure that these don't sound like abstract conversations,\" Buttigieg told me at a Technology 202 live event. \"People want to know about what's going to happen to me.\"</p><p>             BITS: Federal prosecutors are reviewing Amazon founder and\u00a0chief executive Jeffrey P.\u00a0Bezos's\u00a0accusations against the National Enquirer's parent company\u00a0American Media Inc., The Washington Post's\u00a0Devlin Barrett, Matt Zapotosky and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reported. Prosecutors are seeking to determine whether AMI may have run afoul of a non-prosecution agreement signed in September as part of an investigation into\u00a0campaign finance violations by Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer for President Trump. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.</p><p>             Bezos\u00a0has accused the Enquirer\u00a0and AMI of seeking to extort and blackmail him. He said they threatened\u00a0to publish explicit photos of him unless he issued a statement saying that the tabloid's coverage of his relationship with\u00a0former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez was not politically motivated.\u00a0But an attorney for AMI chief executive\u00a0David J. Pecker said the National Enquirer didn't extort or blackmail Bezos, the Associated Press's Michael Balsamo reported.</p><p>\"I think both Bezos and AMI had interests in resolving their interests,\" Elkan Abramowitz, an attorney\u00a0for Pecker, said on\u00a0ABC's \"This Week,\" according to the AP.\u00a0\"It's absolutely not a crime to ask somebody to simply tell the truth. Tell the truth that this was not politically motivated, and we will print no more stories.\"</p><p>             Sanchez's brother, Michael Sanchez, provided the intimate exchanges to the Enquirer,\u00a0the Daily Beast's Lachlan Markay reported. \"No one who spoke to The Daily Beast implied that Michael Sanchez in any way hacked his sister's phone, and he has not been charged with any crime,\" Markay wrote. \"In fact, three people familiar with the Bezos-funded probe told The Daily Beast in late January that it had found no evidence of a hack.\"\u00a0</p><p>             - More news about the feud between Bezos and the Enquirer:          </p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Trump plans to sign an executive order today that would\u00a0launch a U.S. national strategy on artificial intelligence. The American AI Inititiative aims to accelerate U.S. leadership in developing artificial intelligence, largely through\u00a0encouraging AI research and development within the government.\u00a0Other countries, such as China, have coordinated national strategies on emerging technology, and the Trump administration is rolling out this executive order amid growing concerns about the threat China's increased investment in AI poses to the U.S. economy.</p><p>             \"The U.S. is the world leader in artificial intelligence,\" an administration official told reporters on a call Sunday. \"It is not surprising to us that the Chinese are interested in this particular domain and are spending and investing heavily.\"\u00a0          </p><p>But as the U.S. confronts that heavy spending on AI in China, the order does not introduce any new funding for AI research. An administration official told reporters that's because it's the responsibility of Congress to appropriate funds. The order\u00a0does direct\u00a0federal agencies to prioritize AI research in their budgeting and also better track their spending on AI, which is not a category that is typically earmarked today.\u00a0</p><p>The order will also direct agencies to make data that could enable AI more available to researchers, and it aims to set AI governance standards within federal agencies to mainatain a \"safe and trustworthy\" introduction of new AI technologies, especially as there are privacy concerns about government using AI tools.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: Amazon is reconsidering whether to open part\u00a0of its second headquarters in\u00a0New York City amid mounting opposition from activists and several politicians including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), The Post's\u00a0Robert McCartney, Jonathan O'Connell and Patricia Sullivan\u00a0reported, citing two people familiar with Amazon's thinking. Although\u00a0Amazon executives have explored possible alternatives, the company\u00a0             hasn't drawn any specific plan to abandon the New York project\u00a0that is set to bring 25,000 jobs on a new campus in\u00a0Long Island City, which is part of Queens.       </p><p>             The New York state Senate has nominated an opponent of the project, Sen. Michael N. Gianaris (D-Queens), to a state board where he could potentially veto\u00a0the deal for Amazon's New York campus\u00a0- the state's final approval is not excepted before next year.\u00a0             \"The question is whether it's worth it if the politicians in New York don't want the project, especially with how people in Virginia and Nashville have been so welcoming,\" a person familiar with Amazon's thinking told my colleagues. Amazon plans to open the other half of its second headquarters in Crystal City in\u00a0Virginia and a smaller operation in Nashville.       </p><p>             -\u00a0Sprint filed a lawsuit that accuses AT&amp;T of misleading consumers by using the label\u00a0\"5G E,\" which stands for \"5G Evolution,\" even though consumers are still using AT&amp;T's\u00a04G LTE Advanced network, The Post's Brian Fung\u00a0reported. \"The company has said the label reflects the fact that AT&amp;T is on the pathway to rolling out a mainstream 5G network, which could eventually support download speeds up to 100 times faster than the current standard,\" Brian wrote. \"But AT&amp;T has yet to switch on such a network for smartphones, prompting Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint to pile on with tweets, full-page ads in print media and other statements condemning the rhetoric.\"          </p><p>             - Liberal activists\u00a0are urging tech companies such as Facebook and Google not to provide\u00a0technical or financial assistance to Trump's 2020 reelection efforts and the Republican Party out of disagreement with the president's positions, Politico's Nancy Scola reported. Yet such a move could help renew criticism from conservatives that Silicon Valley is biased against them and limit\u00a0tech giants'\u00a0ability to influence policymaking.</p><p>             \"It's no longer acceptable for these companies to play both sides like they're equal,\" Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights advocacy group Color of Change, told Politico. \"If they want to invest resources and money into a candidate who believes that there were good people on both sides of what happened in Charlottesville, they're going to have to be held accountable for it.\"</p><p>             - More technology news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - Privacy advocates\u00a0and policymakers in California worry that lobbying groups for tech giants may seek to weaken a landmark state online privacy law that is set to take effect next year, The Post's Tony Romm reported. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which could help set data privacy standards across the country, would limit the data-collection practices of major tech companies. But the law was adopted hurriedly in June and has left several unresolved issues. Now, privacy advocates are\u00a0\"seeking tougher protections before the law comes into effect,\" Tony reported.          </p><p>             The tech sector has denied that it is trying to water down the legislation.\u00a0\"We support the California Consumer Privacy Act and are looking forward to the law going into effect next year,\" Will Castleberry, who is in charge of state and local policy at Facebook, told my colleague. Yet Facebook and other firms including Google also want Congress to pass federal privacy legislation that would preempt California's privacy measures and other state laws.          </p><p>             -\u00a0Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the French capital is suing Airbnb\u00a0for publishing 1,000 illegal rental advertisements, Reuters reported. The lawsuit could cost Airbnb more than $14 million.\u00a0\"Under French law, home owners in Paris can rent out their places on short-term rental platforms for up to 120 days in a year,\" Reuters reported.\u00a0\"Advertisements must include a registration number to help ensure properties are not rented out for longer.\" An Airbnb\u00a0spokeswoman told the news agency that the rules in\u00a0Paris are\u00a0\"inefficient, disproportionate and in contravention of European rules.\"          </p><p>             - More technology news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News about tech workforce and culture:          </p><p>             - Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Today in funding news:          </p><p>             Today:          </p><p>             Coming soon:          </p><p>Don't Marie Kondo your papers and photos into the trash.

They want to know how those agencies are collaborating with each other\u00a0- as well as the 50 state and territory attorneys general who have launched\u00a0antitrust investigations into Google. Senators raised concerns that antitrust laws haven't been properly enforced, and they pressed the officials to give them more specifics about their probes --\u00a0which include the FTC's investigation of Facebook as well as the\u00a0DOJ's\u00a0broad review of competition in\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0and investigation of Google.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The fact that you're coming here without any specifics, I think, reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \"Call it a culture of capitulation. What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech and no immediate prospect of urgency.\"\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also piled on, saying the agencies shouldn't be given the increased funding or resources they've requested until they sort out their jurisdictional issues.\u00a0</p><p>\"What I see from your agency is frankly a culture of paralysis,\" Hawley said. \"I'm tempted to call it a culture of capitulation.\"\u00a0</p><p>             The fiery hearing highlighted how the agencies could face an uphill battle in their efforts to take on some of\u00a0the world's richest and most powerful companies. The officials both acknowledged that at times their agencies waste time on turf battles and infighting.          </p><p> \"I can't deny that there are instances where [FTC] Chairman [Joseph] Simons and my time is wasted on those types of squabbles,\" said\u00a0Justice's top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim.\u00a0</p><p>These squabbles have been in the spotlight as the Wall Street Journal reports that both agencies have been engaged in a turf war over Facebook. The FTC sent a letter to DOJ last week complaining about that department's behavior, according to the Journal. The FTC is already probing the social-media giant, and taking a close look at the\u00a0company's past acquisitions. DOJ\u00a0wants to scrutinize other company practices, but the Journal reports both think the other agency is violating agreements they reached in the summer.\u00a0</p><p>             Some lawmakers said the infighting raises questions about\u00a0whether there should be two agencies with jurisidiction over antitrust.\u00a0          </p><p>             \"I have been critical of the fact that we have two federal agencies responsible for civil antitrust enforcement,\" Sen. Mike Lee (R.-Utah) said during the hearing.\u00a0\"I have to say, your two agencies have done a remarkable job in recent months of making my points.\"          </p><p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said she is concerned the United States needs to be focused on the bigger picture and look at the \"monopoly issues of our time.\"\u00a0\u00a0European regulators have been much more active on antitrust in the tech sector, and have brought major fines against American companies like Google.</p><p>The senators tough questions come after they loudly criticized recent government actions\u00a0against Big Tech, particularly the FTC's attempts to fine the companies for privacy. Both Blumenthal and Hawley pressed the officials on their recent $5 billion fine against Facebook, which was widely criticized as a slap on a wrist.</p><p>             Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that Sen. Josh Hawley is a Republican.\u00a0          </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Facebook finally unveiled its blueprint for an\u00a0independent oversight board that will review the company's decisions over what content it chooses to remove,my colleague Tony Romm reports. The new Supreme Court-like panel could offer insight into the company's often opaque decisions about what constitutes harmful speech - and potentially allow top executives and engineers to deflect criticism, Tony writes.\u00a0</p><p>The charter released yesterday outlines the oversight board will have around 40 members from around the world, each serving three-year terms. Starting in 2020, users can appeal moderation decisions to the board. The body will also be responsible for selecting \"urgent\" reviews and recommending policy generally.</p><p>Facebook's latest attempt at self-regulation coincides with growing scrutiny from lawmakers over the company's ability to rein in hate speech.\u00a0Today, Facebook will join executives from Google and Twitter for the latest in a series of congressional hearings dedicated to discussing how social media companies can better prevent the spread of white supremacy and other extremist content.</p><p>             NIBBLES: The United States was not adequately prepared for foreign disinformation threats during the 2016 elections and isn't equipped for election integrity challenges in the 2020 campaign, experts and policymakers warned during a symposium Tuesday on information and election security,\u00a0my colleague Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports for the Technology 202.\u00a0</p><p>There has not been enough meaningful progress in the United States on protecting from\u00a0foreign disinformation threats, and it remains difficult for policymakers and private companies to create systemic changes that do not impinge on freedom of expression, the speakers said.</p><p>The event,\u00a0co-organized by PEN America, the Global Digital Policy Incubator at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center and Ellen Weintraub, chairwoman of the FEC,\u00a0emphasized the need for lawmakers, public policy organizations, technology companies and the media to fulfill their responsibilities in ensuring election integrity and fight\u00a0the spread of disinformation online, including new regulations, transparency on user data, increased fact-checking in news coverage, and more, Michelle writes.\u00a0</p><p>Camille Francois, chief innovation officer at Graphika, a firm that identifies the spread of information online, said efforts by foreign actors during the 2018 midterm elections showed there are new and \"more insidious\" tactics since 2016, and that these actors had become better at hiding their traces.\u00a0</p><p>These heightened risks threaten the American electorate's trust in U.S. institutions, experts said, noting their frustration at an inadequate level of public outrage or official response to foreign disinformation threats.\u00a0</p><p>U.S. institutions were \"caught flat-footed\" in 2016 by Russian efforts, which used routine online fraud activities such as audience-building and exploiting algorithms and recommendations on social media, said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>\"We've seen how the misuse of technology threatens our democratic systems, our economy, and increasingly, our national security,\" Warner said. \"The truth is, the United States was caught flat-footed in 2016, and our social media companies failed to anticipate how their platforms could be manipulated and misused by Russian operatives. Frankly, we should've seen it coming.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, one of those regulatory bodies remains defanged. The FEC, which enforces federal election regulations and laws, has been unable to conduct official business since it lost its voting quorum late last month.</p><p>             BYTES: The takeover of a Facebook page geared toward U.S. veterans who support Trump by North Macedonian peddlers of fake news offers a look into how misinformation - and those who profit from it - continue to exploit Facebook,my colleague Craig Timberg reports. Researchers say the incident is just the latest in growing foreign efforts to influence veteran voters.</p><p>Vets for Trump, a page with 100,000 followers, was run by two U.S. veterans who supported the president and posted conservative memes. But a North Macedonian man, Andrej Spasovski, was able to gain administrative access to the page by convincing the two that his company could partner with them to make advertising revenue. Once he gained access, Spasovski revoked the group administrators' access and eventually sold the page to Panche Arsov, another North Macedonia whose efforts to generate profit off conservative misinformation were profiled in BuzzFeed last year.\u00a0</p><p>The page's original administrators were able to regain control in June, but only after months of contacting Facebook. (Facebook said it originally replied to one request in April but did not get a response to its request for more information.)</p><p>Page administrators suspect that the North Macedonian fraudsters were interested in influencing the page's large following of veterans before the 2020 elections. \"They were growing this following, and they were pretending to be us,\" page administrator Vlad Lemets told Craig. \"It all boils down to what would have happened during the election time.\"</p><p>Yesterday President Trump returned to Silicon Valley in his first visit since his election for a fundraiser that's expected to rake in $3 million for the campaign. But the level of secrecy around the event demonstrates that members of the tech industry - including Trump's supporters - are wary about being publicly associated with the administration.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus and Chad Day uncovered that the event, the location of which was kept even from participants, was held at former Sun Microsystems chairman Scott McNealy's house. They confirmed that after a neighbor sent pictures of tents being set up outside.\u00a0</p><p>McNealy has offered limited public praise of Trump in the past, Rebecca and Chad point out, but hasn't donated to Trump. Though Silicon Valley donors tend to favor Democrats, McNealy isn't the only Trump supporter in the Valley. Yet nearly every prominent Trump supporter in Silicon Valley, including Anduril Industries' Palmer Luckey, EasyPost founder Jarrett Streebin, and Intel's Sean Maloney, declined to comment to Recode's Theodore Schleifer\u00a0about the fundraiser.</p><p>             -More news from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             -Today:          </p><p>             - Coming soon          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-32de1e93cb3241d49452f72ae2c72f47</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2Y-D691-JB4M-V018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1735\"/><timeReceived>1:13 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) says it's time for Silicon Valley to start getting serious about cybersecurity threats.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Schatz is calling on the technology industry to create an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) - an independent organization that acts as a clearinghouse where companies can share cybersecurity threats with each other. These organizations have been very popular in other established industries such as financial services, but there is no\u00a0centralized hub for just technology companies.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             \"All mature industries that have a broad impact have an ISAC or an equivalent,\" Schatz said in an interview. \"It's about time we have it in the tech industry.\"\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Schatz - who has drafted a\u00a0privacy bill targeting the technology industry -\u00a0isn't planning to introduce legislation calling for this right now, because he thinks the companies can accomplish this without a mandate from Congress. He notes that successful ISACs are largely private-sector initiatives, but he wants to help: Schatz has\u00a0been talking to one of the technology\u00a0industry's leading trade groups, the Internet Association, about creating one.\u00a0</p><p>             Creating an ISAC, however, would not solve the technology industry's problems with lawmakers. Congress is eager for action -- and reluctant to trust Big Tech to regulate itself -- after\u00a0high-profile data breaches, bugs and leaks\u00a0exposed that companies aren't doing enough to safeguard vast troves of personal data they hold. Members have already introduced bills this year to rein in data tracking and how to empower the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>So Schatz's proposal for a technology industry ISAC would likely come in addition to\u00a0a national privacy law. However, as companies, privacy advocates and policymakers dig in for what is likely to be a heated and lengthy privacy debate, an ISAC could perhaps come together more quickly than a federal privacy law. Schatz said he wants to see the ISAC\u00a0launch within the year.\u00a0</p><p>The industry appears open to the proposal. Internet Association General Counsel Jon Berroya tells me in a statement that\u00a0these organizations can be useful in helping protect privacy, \"especially when these organizations prioritize fostering trust among the participants.\"</p><p>The trade group is \"engaged in preliminary conversations with its members\" about whether such an organization would be useful, he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"[The Internet Association] members share Sen. Schatz's concerns about this important issue and will continue to prioritize exploring this approach - and other approaches - to address threats to their services,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>             Creating an ISAC for the technology industry would not be without its challenges - and it's unclear at this stage how robust and effective such an initiative would be.\u00a0          </p><p>I've previously reported on hurdles social media companies face to share threat data about disinformation with each other. Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, said there's\u00a0lots of hype about threat sharing.\u00a0\"It's one of those things that everyone thinks is a great idea,\" she told me last month. \"But in practice, it's more complicated and not as effective as we think.\"</p><p>             In fiercely competitive Silicon Valley, it's not going to be easy to convince the companies to share sensitive information about cyberthreats with each other - especially when data breaches can inflict serious brand damage on companies. The initiative\u00a0would have to come up with serious incentives and tough guidelines to ensure companies don't use the threats as ammunition against one another.\u00a0</p><p>Also, there's the issue of\u00a0resources. Any industry initiative will have to take measures to ensure it's not a drain on already strapped security teams. Some companies within the technology industry\u00a0participate in other industry ISACs. For example, some members of the Internet Association that build fintech already participate in an ISAC for financial services companies.\u00a0</p><p>Many threats may also not apply across the board. The membership of the Internet Association - which ranges from ride-hailing companies like Uber to social networks like Facebook to dating websites like Match Group - highlights the diversity of the businesses that are considered technology companies. The cybersecurity threats facing Twitter could be pretty different from the potential cyberattacks Lyft worries about.\u00a0</p><p>As the Internet Association talks with its member companies, there has been discussion about how to square this. One option: Creating \"working groups\" to share threat information between specific kinds of\u00a0technology companies, according to a person familiar with the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. There could, for instance, be one threat-sharing group for marketplace businesses like Uber, Airbnb and Lyft, and another for social networks like Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>Sen. Schatz said he thinks the industry can sort out these challenges.\u00a0</p><p>             \"We're confident they're moving expeditiously and will be able to establish an ISAC,\" he said.\u00a0          </p><p>             BITS: Britain-based cybersecurity company\u00a0Netcraft said the number of expired Web security certificates used by federal agencies\u00a0has risen to more than 130 from about 80 in the past week as the government shutdown continues, The Washington Post's\u00a0Brian Fung reported. That includes Web pages that are managed by the White House,\u00a0the Federal Aviation Administration and other federal agencies. Paul Mutton, security consultant for Netcraft, said there could actually be more than 130 federal websites affected by this issue because some expired certificates could have applied to several Web pages.</p><p>             Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, said he contacted the Justice Department and NASA to pitch his company's services including automatic renewal for certificates, but the offer went nowhere. \"They've said, 'Thanks for the offer to help, but we don't actually have anyone who is able to sign a new contract,' \" Prince told Brian. \"Even agreeing to the terms of service is a contract. So they can't even sign up for the free version of the service that would solve this problem.\" Also, TechCrunch's\u00a0Zack Whittaker\u00a0has a list of\u00a0federal HTTPS sites that are set to expire soon, which you can read here.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0Sophie Alpert, an engineering manager at Facebook who identifies as transgender, said she left the company after being \"harassed\" by employees for her views on diversity, CNBC's\u00a0Salvador Rodriguez reported.\u00a0The departure also highlights\u00a0the lack of diversity at Facebook and more generally in Silicon Valley companies.\u00a0Alpert, who left the social network to join\u00a0a company named Humu, said she faced criticism on the anonymous workplace app Blind.</p><p>             \"Facebook is good for many people, but it's not the right place for me right now,\" Alpert wrote in a post on Workplace, Facebook's internal social network, according to Rodriguez. \"I want to spend my time at a place willing to push further on diversity and inclusion. One where it's not okay to write on Workplace that white privilege doesn't exist. One where if I call out that our board has too many white men, I don't get harassed by other employees on Blind with transphobic messages saying I should be fired.\"</p><p>             BYTES:             The Trump administration used Excel spreadsheets as well as more than 60 other databases and files that made it \"nearly impossible\" track the thousands of children separated from their families at the border,according to Wired's Issie Lapowsky.</p><p>A Health and Human Service's Office of Inspector General report found that since 2017, \"the Trump administration has separated thousands more children from their parents than it previously disclosed and that it tracked these kids in ad hoc, disparate databases, including Excel spreadsheets and Microsoft Sharepoint accounts, further complicating the already tortured process of figuring out where those children are today,\" she reported.</p><p>The report said the number and status of the children separated from their parents under the Trump administration policy is unknown. . It lists the \"lack of an existing, integrated data system to track separated families\" as a key obstacle to reunification, Lapowsky reported.</p><p>             -- The talk\u00a0about safety and revised ambitions for autonomous vehicles at\u00a0the CES technology show in Las Vegas and the Detroit auto show this year\u00a0underscores\u00a0how \"cautious optimism\" in the driverless car industry has replaced the hype of previous years, according to the Wall Street Journal's\u00a0Tim Higgins.\u00a0\"What was underappreciated by the industry is how long and how difficult it would be to industrialize the technology,\" Karl Iagnemma, president of automotive supplier Aptiv's autonomous mobility, told the Journal. \"Industrywide that recognition has dawned.\"</p><p>A fatal crash involving an Uber test autonomous vehicle ushered in this more cautious approach. Moreover, developers of autonomous vehicles still face difficulties in addressing simple road scenarios - such as unprotected left turns. \"The immediate future of autonomous vehicles is more subdued: plodding shuttles that drive around the block and cars that travel in confined, well-practiced routes with not one but two safety operators inside,\" according to\u00a0Higgins.          </p><p>             - As some companies such as Netflix\u00a0move to stop sharing a portion of\u00a0subscription or sales revenue\u00a0with Apple, consumers find themselves \"trapped\" in a war that's being fought on Apple's\u00a0App Store,\u00a0Bloomberg Opinion columnist Shira Ovide wrote.\u00a0\"The reason for this mess is that companies have a binary choice: give Apple up to 30 percent of each sale, or elect not to sell digital goods from their iOS apps,\"\u00a0Ovide wrote. \"Apple takes a cut of purchases made in iOS apps that use the company's iTunes payments system if people are buying digital items to use in the app.\" She added:\u00a0\"It's Apple's way or no in-app purchases.\"</p><p>             - Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey wouldn't say whether\u00a0President Trump's account would be removed from the platform if he were to tweet explicit calls for the murder\u00a0of journalists, according to\u00a0HuffPost's Ashley Feinberg. Dorsey said in an interview with\u00a0Feinberg that it is \"important that the world sees how global leaders think and how they act\" in response to a question about whether Trump could do anything that would be considered as a misuse of\u00a0Twitter and result in ban from the social network.</p><p>Feinberg then followed up:\u00a0\"OK, but if Trump tweeted out asking each of his followers to murder one journalist, would you remove him?\" Dorsey replied:\u00a0\"That would be a violent threat. We'd definitely . . . You know we're in constant communication with all governments around the world. So we'd certainly talk about it.\"</p><p>From Dorsey:</p><p>             - More tech news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - More than a dozen privacy groups called for the creation of a new federal data privacy agency\u00a0that would be tasked with regulating how companies and other organizations gather personal data, the Associated Press's Rachel Lerman and Tali Arbel reported. The plan would also impose limits on data collection by companies and would set the Federal Trade Commission aside when it comes to privacy protection. \"Privacy advocates are fed up with the FTC and with Washington failing to [rein] in the immense power the big data giants hold,\" said Jeffrey Chester,\u00a0executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of the groups that helped draft the plan, according to\u00a0the AP.</p><p>             - The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Northern California sued the federal government to obtain information about federal authorities' alleged \"social media surveillance activities,\" according to an ACLU news release. The suit, which\u00a0was filed in the\u00a0U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, targets the Justice, Homeland Security and State departments as well as the FBI,\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0and\u00a0U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.</p><p>\"The ACLU's lawsuit seeks the release of each agency's guidelines and policies governing the use of social media surveillance, communications with private businesses or social media platforms, and materials related to purchasing or building\u00a0social media monitoring tools, among other records,\" the ACLU said.</p><p>             - As the shutdown continues, a website built by the companies\u00a0Moxit and\u00a0BLEN Corp. seeks to connect furloughed workers with freelance jobs via\u00a0Unfurlough.us.

And Democrats are in on the action: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a presidential candidate\u00a0who has made breaking up Big Tech a central part of her\u00a0campaign pitch.\u00a0</p><p>             Republicans and Democrats alike on Capitol Hill say the regulators' latest moves are overdue.          </p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), one of the Republican party's top tech critics, said:</p><p>Warren (D-Mass.) said:\u00a0</p><p>The White House did not respond to requests for comment from the New York Times about the regulators' plans. But two people familiar with President Trump's thinking told the Times he would welcome action against Google.\u00a0</p><p>             Potential antitrust scrutiny should worry Google - and the broader tech industry, writes Bloomberg's Shira Ovide in a column this weekend. Google previously tangled with regulators at the FTC, but the agency ultimately decided in 2013 not to force Google to alter broad aspects of its business or to break up the company.</p><p>But Google is in a dramatically different position in Washington in 2019. The company is under fire for a laundry list of concerns, including data privacy practices, allegations of anti-conservative bias and concerns about its ambitions in China.</p><p>Ovide writes if an investigation moves forward, it \"will no doubt be broad, lengthy, messy, and impossible for Google and its investors to predict.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"That should terrify Google and every other big technology company -\u00a0because there's no guarantee that the antitrust Klieg light will turn on one company alone,\" she wrote.</p><p>             To be sure, the regulators' moves are in very early stages. Tony noted in his stories that the FTC's course of action for Amazon and the Justice Department's interest in Google are not immediately clear. But the arrangement the agencies negotiated to allow this level of scrutiny typically foreshadows greater antitrust action. (Google declined to comment and Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment over the weekend.)\u00a0</p><p>From Tony:\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: The Trump administration\u00a0is requiring almost all U.S. visa applicants to submit their social media accounts, previous email accounts and phone numbers,\u00a0the Associated Press reports.\u00a0The move marks a broad expansion of the administration's screening of potential immigrants and visitors.\u00a0          </p><p>The move -- which was first proposed in March 2018 -- just took effect as the State Department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to\u00a0request the information, including \"social media identifiers,\" from almost all U.S. applicants. The change will impact about 15 million foreigners per year.\u00a0</p><p>\"National security is our top priority when adjudicating visa applications, and every prospective traveler and immigrant to the United States undergoes extensive security screening,\" the department told the AP. \"We are constantly working to find mechanisms to improve our screening processes to protect U.S. citizens, while supporting legitimate travel to the United States.\"</p><p>In the past, these identifiers\u00a0were only requested in the past from applicants who were targeted for extra scrutiny, such as people\u00a0traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. About 65,000 applicants per year had been included in\u00a0that category.</p><p>The State Department says gathering the information from more applicants \"will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.\"</p><p>             NIBBLES: Trump escalated his attacks on AT&amp;T early Monday morning, writing on Twitter that if people stopped subscribing to AT&amp;T, it would result in changes at one of his top targets -- CNN.\u00a0Last year, the telecom giant acquired Time Warner, which is CNN's parent company.\u00a0</p><p>The tweets follow a report that Trump ordered Gary Cohn, then the director of the National Economic Council, to pressure the Justice Department to intervene in the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner Inc., CNN's parent company. Cohn reportedly warned John Kelly not to intervene, and it's unclear if the president ever made direct requests to the Justice Department. A federal appeals court upheld the merger earlier this year after the Department of Justice challenged it as anti-competitive.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: A D.C. judge dealt an early defeat to Facebook on Friday, after a judge rejected the social network's request to block a case brought by the D.C. attorney general targeting the company's data privacy practices,\u00a0my colleague Tony writes.\u00a0</p><p>D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine can now start \"obtaining all of the evidence proving that Facebook broke District law and did not follow its own policies to protect the privacy of more than 340,000 Facebook users who reside in the District,\" he said in a statement Saturday.</p><p>Racine\u00a0filed the suit against Facebook\u00a0last year, primarily in response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when a political consultancy accessed Facebook data on 87 million users without their consent. The incident combined with other privacy blunders highlighted that that the social network had violated the District's consumer-protection laws, the attorney general said, resulting in hundreds of thousands of local residents having their personal data misused.</p><p>Facebook has long argued against\u00a0Racine's allegations. Lawyers for the company contend that it never misled users about the privacy protections afforded to their personal data. They've also argued that as a California-based company, the District doesn't have jurisdiction against the company.\u00a0</p><p>             -- Tech news from the private sector:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Several 2020 presidential candidates were in the Bay Area in recent days, as Democrats increasingly court the region's wealthy donors,\u00a0according to my colleague Michelle Ye\u00a0Hee Lee.\u00a0</p><p> \"This weekend, several candidates were scheduled to appear at fundraisers in the San Francisco Bay area, including Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.),\" Michelle wrote. \"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who famously built his campaign around small donations in 2016, on Saturday held his first fundraiser of the primary this weekend in San Francisco. However, he has priced the lowest-tiered ticket at $27 - the average donation to his campaign in 2016.\"</p><p>Elizabeth Warren also was in San Francisco over the weekend, where she posed with her billboard calling for a breakup of Big Tech. Dan Geldon, Warren's chief of staff, tweets:</p><p>             -- Schools across the U.S. are increasingly investing in \"a massive digital surveillance infrastructure,\"\u00a0according to Education Week's\u00a0Benjamin Herold, often with\u00a0little attention to privacy or the systems' impact on civil liberties.\u00a0          </p><p>Companies monitor the social media posts of everyone in the areas around schools, including adults. Other companies trawl the private digital content of millions of students using district-issued technologies. In addition, the schools increasingly are adopting tip-reporting apps, facial-recognition software, and other new technology systems.</p><p>Herold notes that the technology has already had far-reaching consequences in schools across the country. Though there are only limited annectdotal reports of the companies preventing violence in schools, they have been effective in highlighting self-harm among students. But school administrators also find themselves navigating new legal and ethical quandaries.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's similar to post-9/11,\" Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a lawyer with the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University law school, told Herold.\u00a0\"There is an understandable instinct to do whatever you can to stop the next horrible thing from happening. But the solution doesn't solve the problem, and it creates new issues of its own.\"</p><p>             -- More tech news from the public sector:\u00a0          </p><p>             -- Tech news generating buzz online:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-87fbd00efbc14212b383a72567835469</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W84-HC31-JB4M-V02V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1660\"/><timeReceived>1:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As two of the tech industry's top challengers appeared in last night's Democratic debate, its recent political woes got little airtime.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Right out of\u00a0the gate,\u00a0it seemed like it could be a tough night for techies,\u00a0as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) slammed Amazon in his opening remarks, calling out the company for not paying \"one nickel in federal income tax\" last year. But mentions of other tech companies -- or privacy, data breaches or their expanding power -- largely stopped there. Except if you count when former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper said \"Google it.\"\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             That's surprising given how the two top-polling candidates onstage, Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have made Facebook and Amazon symbols of their broader push against the concentration of corporate power on the 2020 campaign trail.          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren particularly made a splash with her plan to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon earlier this year, but antitrust issues didn't come up at all last night - even after federal agencies announced a\u00a0flurry of new investigations into tech companies' power in the weeks since the first round of debates last month. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos also owns The Post.)\u00a0</p><p>             Big Tech was clearly preparing\u00a0for a challenge from the liberal candidates. One trade group, TechNet, issuing a warning before the debates kicked off that \"big doesn't automatically mean bad.\"</p><p>\"The growth and expansion of these companies should be a source of pride because it has led to jobs and opportunities across the entire country,\" said TechNet chief executive Linda Moore in a blog post. \"As the candidates continue to formulate their ideas to promote healthy economic competition, we want to ensure we do not stray from the core mission of antitrust law to protect consumers from harm.\"       </p><p>             Technology companies have been a ripe target for candidates this campaign season as public trust in the companies has faltered in the wake of high-profile data privacy mishaps, such as Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. But as candidates tried to prove onstage that they were the contender who could ultimately take on President Trump, they focused on other hot-button political topics with perhaps broader appeal, such as\u00a0health care, immigration and climate change.       </p><p>                             \"             These questions were largely orthodox horse race stuff,\" said Matthew Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a think tank that has called for greater antitrust action against the tech giants.       </p><p>             There's been a shift in public opinion about the tech companies in the last four years - but it's not clear if that's going to impact voters' decisions at the polls in 2020.\u00a0       </p><p>          A Pew Research study published earlier this week found that members of both political parties are much less positive about the technology companies. About 50 percent of people surveyed by Pew said technology companies are having a positive impact on the country, down from four years ago, when 71 percent said the companies were having a positive impact.       </p><p>          But people still don't seem to distrust them as much as other institutions that have been political targets. While 33 percent of respondents said technology companies are having a negative impact on the U.S., there was a 39 percent faction that said the same of\u00a0banks and 64 percent about the news media.\u00a0       </p><p>             However,\u00a0tech giants such as\u00a0Amazon and Google still have cause for concern beyond tech policy issues: Pew found 53 percent of Americans say large corporations specifically are having a negative effect on the country. That's likely why most of the candidates have been linking the companies to broader themes around how corporate giants are exacerbating economic inequality in the U.S. At one point last night, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg made a quick reference to his new plan to take on gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft to ensure that drivers who are currently classified as independent contractors\u00a0get more protections, including a\u00a0minimum wage.\u00a0       </p><p>             It's likely that there could be more tech news onstage tonight as the second round of debates kicks off. Both Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.Y.) will be onstage, and they have deep ties to Silicon Valley.</p><p>It could also be tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang's last chance to be on the debate stage and make his case for a universal basic income, which he says will protect American workers against a coming wave of job automation driven by artificial intelligence. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who sued Google last week for censoring her campaign, will have her moment in the spotlight. Expect her to potentially make a case against the company's dominance. She said during an interview on Fox News this week that Google's power is a threat to elections and free speech.\u00a0</p><p>          \"Tech platforms will\u00a0continue to be in the spotlight because they are unavoidable centers of power in our elections and our commerce,\" Stoller told me.\u00a0       </p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Members of Congress wasted no time in using             the breach of over 100 million credit card applications at Capital One to call for stricter laws regarding consumer privacy.          </p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) suggested that stronger laws such as the one he's been pushing are needed to hold CEOs accountable for breaches:</p><p>Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) said that he and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois) are currently drafting \"comprehensive data privacy and security legislation to protect consumers.\"</p><p>Efforts by both parties in Congress to roll out new privacy legislation has moved slowly, but the newest breach could add urgency to the process. Much like with Equifax, which recently paid out $700 million to settle with U.S. regulators after exposing the social security numbers of more than 147 million Americans in 2017, lawmakers are also looking to haul in the company for a congressional hearing.</p><p>From Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.):</p><p>Capital One is already facing an investigation from the New York Attorney General's office as well as a class action lawsuit filed in federal court yesterday.\u00a0</p><p>             NIBBLES: Trump amplified two Twitter accounts affiliated with online conspiracy theory community QAnon, my colleagues Tony Romm and Colby Itkowitz report. This is just the latest instance of the president using his account to amplify fringe followers who believe that there is a conspiracy theory to overthrow him.</p><p>One of the accounts retweeted by Trump was suspended a few hours later for violating community standards prohibiting using multiple accounts to spread spam, Betsy Woodruff and Kevin Poulsen at the Daily Beast report. The president retweeted a tweet from the now-suspended account that read\u00a0\"DEMOCRATS ARE THE TRUE ENEMIES OF AMERICA!\" Just a few days\u00a0earlier, the user had espoused\u00a0statements promoting Q-Anon and theories that Democrats had murdered children for body parts.</p><p>Trump also tagged one user in a tweet calling for voter identification laws - helping the user's reach grow from just 2,000 followers to over 11,000.</p><p>While it's unclear if Trump knows he's amplifying supporters of the conspiracy, getting the president's attention can embolden believers, Tony and Colby report. Almost immediately after the tweets, QAnon followers discussed the president's action on 8chan, a forum popular for spreading QAnon conspiracies.</p><p>             BYTES: Ring, Amazon's home security company, has been dictating how law enforcement agencies discuss their use of the technology with both their communities and the press,Dell Cameron at Gizmodo reports. Partnering with Ring allows for police departments to request surveillance footage from the devices of customers. In return, police departments promote the company to citizens. But the partnerships are often kept in secret from the community, making it more difficult for citizens to know what surveillance measures are being used against them.</p><p>Documents obtained by Gizmodo from three states show that Ring \"pre-writes almost all of the messages shared by police across social media, and attempts to legally obligate police to give the company final say on all statements about its products, even those shared with the press.\" In some cases, the negotiations over how to communicate the partnership were guided to maximize purchases of Ring through local subsidies for homeowners.</p><p>But not all law enforcement agencies seem to be on board with the aggressive strategy. At least one police department in Florida, where Ring has a number of partnerships, refused to accept Amazon's terms due to concerns it would violate public records laws in the state.\u00a0</p><p>             - News from the private\u00a0sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>Mike Issac, a tech reporter at the New York Times, counts down to the real internet primary:</p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-547e516ca6d34f27bb6e8e4a1451858d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPG-V4K1-DXKP-J1PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><timeReceived>1:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

States are becoming an\u00a0important and perhaps more\u00a0formidable force when it comes to addressing competition in the\u00a0technology industry, experts tell me.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than half of the country's state attorneys\u00a0general are planning to announce an antitrust investigation into Google next week, my colleague Tony Romm reports. The group is expected to be bipartisan, and the announcement probably will kick off a lengthy, years-long process that could have major implications for the future of the search giant's business.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The market will take this investigation seriously, and it has the potential to either nudge [the Justice Department] toward a lawsuit against Google or to give any lawsuit more bipartisan credibility,\" said Paul Gallant, an industry analyst at Cowen\u00a0&amp; Co.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gallant tells me\u00a0this lawsuit would have attracted little attention a few years ago, but that has changed in light of increased state-level scrutiny of technology and telecom companies. In recent weeks, a group of more than 15 states have\u00a0sued to block the pending merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. The lawsuits highlight how the states can be more aggressive than federal regulators after the Justice Department approved the deal and the Federal Communications Commission indicated it plans to also give it the green light.\u00a0</p><p>States have always had the tools to address antitrust issues in the tech industry. But experts explain they haven't always been used since doing so is costly and time intensive. States are now opting to taking a more active roles as the technology companies' size comes under scrutiny in the wake of high-profile privacy mishaps and election meddling.          </p><p>\"There's been a tendency to just rely on the federal government to play the lead role,\" said Gene Kimmelman, a senior adviser at the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"There's a greater recognition now that the digital marketplace is increasingly dominated by a few firms who have remained the lead players for numerous years.</p><p>\"This is all a trend that state enforcers are recognizing and stepping up to the plate to play a role in policing,\" added Kimmelman, who was known as the Obama administration's \"secret weapon\" on antitrust in the Department of Justice.</p><p>It is not yet clear whether some or all of the attorneys general also plan to unveil\u00a0additional probes into other tech giants, including Amazon and Facebook, which have faced similar antitrust scrutiny at the federal level, Tony writes.\u00a0</p><p>The states attorneys general are coordinating with antitrust officials in Washington, where there has recently been a flurry of antitrust activity. Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for the DOJ's antitrust division, said at a conference last month that his office is coordinating with the state officials, but declined to offer more details. Justice\u00a0 \u00a0is currently conducting a broad antitrust review of large tech companies, and Facebook recently said that the Federal Trade Commission opened an antitrust investigation into its business.\u00a0</p><p>State attorneys general have a history of contributing to federal regulators' moves on antitrust. In the 1990s, the states helped\u00a0build a broader case against Microsoft\u00a0after rivals warned that it used its Windows monopoly to stifle competition, Tony notes.\u00a0</p><p>It's not just antitrust enforcers that tech companies have to worry about - Congress is also getting in on the action. Most of the activity thus far has been in the House, where lawmakers are leading a wide-ranging investigation of competition in the technology sector. But Senate Republicans are also hosting hearings on the issue, including one later this month about mergers and acquisitions in the tech sector.\u00a0</p><p>But while there's bipartisan interest in looking into competition issues in the tech sector, experts don't expect the hearings to result in any legislation before the 2020 election.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's unlikely to see swift action,\" Kimmelman said. \"It's an extremely important step for Congress to educate itself and for policymakers to engage to understand the problem.\u00a0Once that happens it's much easier to move legislation in a timely fashion.\"\u00a0          </p><p>Policymakers considering whether antitrust law needs to be updated to address the tech sector may face an uphill battle. The companies under scrutiny have very different business models, and the competition concerns vary significantly from business to business. Some tech policy experts worry that Congress may not be up to the task.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's not clear that the U.S. Congress is capable of dealing with nuance and complicated challenges in this moment,\" said Blair Levin, who served in the Federal Communications Commission during the Clinton administration.          </p><p>He says there is an \"inchoate\" consensus building in Washington that it's time for antitrust action against Big Tech, but he doesn't expect quick congressional action on such a complicated problem.\u00a0</p><p>             \"There is a sense something must be done, but there's not a consensus of what should be done,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Facebook, Google and other tech titans are making a broad lobbying push in Sacramento to\u00a0change\u00a0California's consumer privacy law before it takes effect in January, Tony\u00a0reports. A lobbying organization representing social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook has even targeted people in Sacramento with social media ads warning the law could result in tech companies charging consumers for services that are free.\u00a0       </p><p>          Privacy advocates are criticizing the broad campaign to rewrite the California Consumer Protection Act as a move that would curtail consumers' rights. The campaign hasn't been successful yet - but with only two weeks left in California's legislative cycle, the companies aren't giving up. CCPA would allow consumers to see what personal information\u00a0businesses collect and sell about them, and industry lobbyists have been pushing changes\u00a0limiting what qualifies as personal information under CCPA.\u00a0       </p><p>          The Internet Association, which represents tech giants Google and Facebook, spent nearly $176,000 in lobbying over the past three months alone, Tony found. And the ads flooding California voters, sponsored under the name \"Keep the Internet free\" have\u00a0reached nearly 200,000 Twitter users.       </p><p>          While the law has faced criticism from both industry and consumer privacy advocates, as Tony points out, many proponents see it as an important model for other states as Congress has yet to pass federal privacy legislation.\u00a0       </p><p>             NIBBLES: Beto O'Rourke's campaign manager is calling on Facebook, Twitter, and Google to crack down on misinformation after\u00a0a\u00a0false story that the gunman in the Odessa, Texas\u00a0shooting had a sticker for the candidate on his car spread online this weekend. Facebook spokesman Andy Stone tells me the company is looking into the campaign's claims that inauthentic behavior amplified content promoting the false story\u00a0on its platform.\u00a0          </p><p>Campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said the tweets and posts about the unverified rumor\u00a0received tens of thousands of retweets and shares on the social media platform. She blamed a right-wing bot network for amplifying the claim:</p><p>O'Malley Dillon tweeted that\u00a0the campaign suspects at least one Facebook post was amplified by inauthentic behavior. \"The Fuentes post had 34,000 shares but just 46 comments - you'd see a much different ratio if it was spread authentically,\" Lauren Hitt, O'Rourke's national director of rapid response, told me over email, adding that the campaign has not heard from any of the tech companies named in the tweet.\u00a0</p><p>As O'Malley Dillon points out, the claims were also\u00a0amplified on Twitter by Anthony Shaffer, a former Defense Intelligence Agency officer and a member of Trump's 2020 advisory board. Shaffer stood by his comments when asked about the post by\u00a0my colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker.</p><p>The campaign isn't just calling out social networks. O'Malley Dillon also tweeted that the gunman's name was the second\u00a0highest-trending search query on Google related to O'Rourke\u00a0in the last week.</p><p>Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             BYTES: The German Marshall Fund's Alliance for Securing Democracy is rebooting its dashboard monitoring Russian information operations in time for 2020, it announced today. Researchers say the new dashboard will allow for a more comprehensive look at how Russian influence operations are evolving leading up to the election.</p><p>The Hamilton 2.0 dashboard captures content from more than 140 diplomatic and media accounts on Twitter, four state-sponsored news websites, and broadcasts and YouTube videos from RT, a Russia-funded international media outlet. This is a shift from the previous version of the dashboard that monitored more than 600 accounts linked to Russia, a hazy definition that garnered the tool criticism for potentially overestimating the presence of Russian trolls on Twitter.</p><p>The more narrow approach reflects the increasing difficulty of attributing troll accounts to Russia, Rachael Wilson, head of external affairs at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, tells me. She says efforts to detect and expose 2016-era information operations - particularly in real time - are less effective than they were immediately following the U.S. presidential election.</p><p>The role of state-funded media in spreading disinformation has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent weeks. Twitter banned recently banned ads by state-sponsored media after China-backed media outlets used the tool to spread disinformation about protesters in Hong Kong. Yet state-sponsored media still has a stronghold on Twitter and Facebook. Russian state media has spread similar pro-Beijing narratives, ASD's disinformation fellow Bret Schafer           says.       </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>Facebook said if the Homeland Security Department creates fake accounts to monitor the social media of foreigners applying for entry into the country, the company will consider the accounts in violation of its policies and shut them down             ,\u00a0the Associated Press's Tami Abdollah\u00a0reports. The company affirmed its policy following a report\u00a0last week that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revised an internal policy to allow agents to employ fake social media accounts to check people applying for visas, green cards and citizenship.\u00a0       </p><p>          \"Law enforcement authorities, like everyone else, are required to use their real names on Facebook and we make this policy clear,\" Facebook spokeswoman Sarah Pollack\u00a0told Tami. \"Operating fake accounts is not allowed, and we will act on any violating accounts.\" Pollack said the company would remove any fake accounts that were reported.       </p><p>          But Facebook has struggled to rein in the use of fake profiles by law enforcement agencies in the past. Just last year the company\u00a0wrote a letter to the Memphis police department\u00a0requesting that it stop using fake profiles to monitor black activists. The increased use of Facebook for surveillance by the federal government could force the company to grapple with implications for user privacy. The State Department began requiring visa applicants to provide their social media profiles for review last month, and President Trump suggested the Justice Department should work with all levels\u00a0of law enforcement to monitor the site to predict mass shooters.       </p><p>             - More news\u00a0from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming soon:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-22e500467d5f4dcba9d98a9ca609f09e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYY-TX31-DXKP-J12M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1986\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 4, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He wants to create a consortium to make that easier. \u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just like banks work together to\u00a0share data about common types of fraud, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) says it's time for Silicon Valley to have an equivalent alliance to share disinformation threats, as well as about hate speech and\u00a0inflammatory content. Right now, he says a bad actor could be kicked off Facebook and just go open an account on\u00a0Twitter. He wants to make sure the lines of communication are open among technology\u00a0companies so they can have a more coordinated response to malicious actors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khanna tells me he's in the preliminary stages of drafting legislation to incentivize companies to participate in such an association. He says law enforcement would also participate and share declassified information with the companies.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Social media companies were ill-equipped to detect a lot of the interference ahead of the 2016 election,\" Khanna said. \"They need more help from law enforcement agencies.\"</p><p>             Khanna is drafting this legislation as lawmakers from both parties are stepping up their oversight of Silicon Valley and regulating Big Tech is emerging as a rare bipartisan issue in Washington. While election security has become deeply partisan in the fallout of the 2016 election, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are taking a closer look at the ways tech companies are addressing disinformation ahead of the 2020 elections.\u00a0          </p><p>Khanna says he's engaged in \"constructive\" conversations about developing such an alliance\u00a0with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who Khanna says shares his concerns about disinformation on the platforms. A spokeswoman for McCarthy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0</p><p>             Ensuring Silicon Valley companies have a more coordinated response to disinformation ahead of the 2020 election will be no easy task. The companies are very competitive with one another, have varied resources to address election security and have very different standards when it comes to handling\u00a0disinformation on their platforms. That shifting standard was evident by the varied responses to a doctored video that made House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)\u00a0appear intoxicated. YouTube removed the video, while Facebook allowed the video to remain online with a prompt that notified viewers that there was additional reporting available.\u00a0</p><p>Khanna says in addition to sharing threat information with each other, the consortium would allow tech companies to talk more directly about the big questions confronting the industry and develop norms together for dealing with thorny problems. He thinks that humanists, philosophers and legal scholars should also be part of that dialogue.\u00a0</p><p>Many industries already have similar consortia where they share data about cybersecurity threats, and one already exists for information technology companies like Intel and Oracle. They're often industry-led initiatives, and other lawmakers, like Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) have called for Internet platforms like Facebook and Google to create their own group.</p><p>Already, tech companies like Facebook, Twitter\u00a0and Google do coordinate with each other when it comes to violent terrorist content, through the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. The companies recently\u00a0coordinated their response to videos of the deadly shootings in New Zealand earlier this year through that group.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) fired shots at Facebook yesterday as the company released a market research app for Android that will collect data about competing apps. Warner said the company's close monitoring of potential competitors underscores the need for greater regulation of the social media giant.          </p><p>\"One of the reasons we have seen so little in the way of accountability with the major social platforms is a lack of competition,\" Warner wrote in a statement to the Technology 202.\u00a0\"One of the ways that Facebook has maintained the status quo is by closely monitoring user activity to spot trends and potential competitors, and moving to buy them out or adopt their innovative features for Facebook. It's one of the reasons we need regulation, like interoperability legislation, that will encourage innovation, support competition, and actually give users more choices when it comes to social media.\"</p><p>Warner's comments followed a report from TechCrunch's Josh Constine\u00a0that revealed Facebook was reviving its paid market research program after shutting down similar programs earlier this year amid criticism. Facebook has previously come under scrutiny for using data from paid market research programs to quickly buy or mimic emerging competitors - so it was a bold move to revive it at the height of antitrust hand-wringing in Washington.</p><p>          The new market research app, which can be used only by adults invited into the program, promises greater transparency from the company as to what data is being collected and how it's being used. But as Josh, TechCrunch's editor-at-large, points out, the program is still a bit vague:       </p><p>Facebook's new app comes just four months after the company shut down its Research and Onavo programs following a TechCrunch report that revealed\u00a0how the company was paying teens for their phone data. Lawmakers, including Warner, accused the company of\u00a0spying on minors.</p><p>             NIBBLES:\u00a0U.S. venture firms that once sought Chinese capital are now turning it down and asking investors to sell their stakes thanks to escalating U.S.-China tensions, reports Rolfe Winkler in the Wall Street Journal. The scare has pushed U.S. start-ups to try to divest Chinese investors and caused some major Chinese firms to decamp from Silicon Valley altogether.\u00a0</p><p>Some China-backed venture capitalists have accused the Department of Defense of singling them out; others, like Chinese giant Baidu, have coped by restructuring their investments to avoid government scrutiny.</p><p>U.S. lawmakers and the FBI have raised red flags about the threat of Chinese venture firms stealing intellectual property from Silicon Valley start-ups and passing it back to the Chinese government.</p><p>\"While many people in Washington understand the gravity of the threat, that's not true across the country,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), one of the members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who has been leading the charge in briefing American companies against intellectual-property theft.</p><p>Not all of Silicon Valley is buying it. Rolfe talked to venture investors who said the heavy-handed approach out of Washington is an overreaction that is cutting\u00a0off the industry from important capital.</p><p>             BYTES:\u00a0The top antitrust regulator at the Justice Department has a warning for Big Tech: Having free or really cheap products won't protect you from greater antitrust scrutiny, according to\u00a0a report from Bloomberg's Ben Brody.\u00a0</p><p>\"The antitrust division does not take a myopic view of competition,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a speech today.\u00a0\"Price effects alone do not provide a complete picture of market dynamics, especially in digital markets in which the profit-maximizing price is zero.\" Delrahim offered that antitrust laws should work to protect competition when evaluating mergers and that \"harm to innovation\" can hurt consumers.</p><p>Delrahim blasted the tech giants as \"digital gatekeepers\" and signaled that as his agency steps up its oversight of Google and Apple, it will be looking to the past for information. Delrahim told the crowd that he did not \"pretend to have all of the answers today\" but pointed to a few choice examples to demonstrate a \"long history of trustbusting in emerging and technologically advanced markets\" by the United States. Most notably, Delrahim employed the example of the 1998 Microsoft case that forced the firm to allow rival Internet browsers on its operating system. The action paved the way for companies like Google but ultimately left Microsoft intact. The examples of Standard Oil and AT&amp;T offered more direct analogies for the potential Big Tech breakup called for by Democrats.</p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             - News from the private sector:          </p><p>             - \u00a0Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             Coming soon:</p><p>The\u00a0House Intelligence Committee\u00a0on Thursday hosts a hearing on the \"National Security Challenges of Artificial Intelligence, Manipulated Media, and Deepfakes.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-55e081f7ca9748ba8ff1211115725f1a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB2-8581-JB4M-V2K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1452\"/><timeReceived>12:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 12, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

I'm flying to Las Vegas this morning for CES.             Keep reading The Technology 202             for the latest tech policy developments at the show. Also follow along with my colleagues             Heather Kelly             and             Geoffrey Fowler             , who are already discovering new             innovations             and             getting (temporary) tattoos             of The Post's editor Marty Baron.\u00a0          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ctrl + N</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             Over the last decade, lawmakers and regulators slowly woke up to the consequences of the tech industry's unchecked rise in power. In the 2020s, they'll try to take back control.\u00a0          </p><p>The decade will kick off with a bang: Tech companies will feel the heat this year from a presidential election, increased antitrust scrutiny in Washington and a new privacy law that's just coming into effect in California. Expect Congress to be focused on tech's role in the campaigns and fighting off disinformation, while states also make greater investments in regulating the industry.\u00a0</p><p>Here are (some) of the top issues we'll be tracking at The Technology 202 in 2020:</p><p>             1. Tech companies will grapple with their responsibility to separate fact from fiction online           -           especially during a closely watched presidential election cycle.          </p><p>Their first test of 2020 came before many had even recovered from their New Years' celebrations. A deceptively edited video of former vice president Joe Biden that widely circulated on Twitter last week could be a harbinger of disinformation in the election.\u00a0</p><p>Twitter confirmed Friday that it would not remove the 19-second clip, which was edited to make the Democratic presidential candidate appear racist. The video's spread was bolstered by several reporters and people with large Twitter followings, who shared it with little context.\u00a0</p><p>As my colleague Greg Sargent wrote: \"If you thought the 2016 election was awash in disinformation and lies, get ready: The 2020 election is going to make that affair look like a knitting session.\"</p><p>Biden is warning that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to disinformation in the aftermath of the video's spread, according to The New York Times. That could put even more pressure on Silicon Valley companies to invest in rooting out falsehoods on their platform and set the stage for battles between candidates and companies in the coming years. \u00a0</p><p>             2. Disinformation tactics will evolve as Silicon Valley invests heavily to avoid a repeat of the 2016 election. \u00a0          </p><p>The cast of actors who could potentially target the 2020 races is much broader - and their arsenal of weapons is constantly evolving.\u00a0</p><p>Russia is no longer the only threat. Iran and China have shown that they are also investing in influence operations on social media. Domestic actors also played a significant role in spreading disinformation in the 2018 midterms.\u00a0</p><p>The edited Biden video, and a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that went viral last year, show how powerful video editing can be in creating a false political narrative. And researchers warn that deepfakes - which allow people to use artificial intelligence to make it appear someone is saying or doing something that never happened - are developing swiftly and creating new concerns.\u00a0</p><p>Expect these evolutions to be a key focus of Washington lawmakers in the coming weeks. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will kick things off Wednesday with a hearing on \"manipulation and deception in the digital age.\"\u00a0</p><p>             3. California's new privacy law took effect on Jan. 1, and other states will consider adopting their own data-collection restrictions in the absence of federal action.\u00a0          </p><p>It's official. California residents have new controls over their privacy. But tech companies still have some time before enforcement of the law begins in six months, so expect them to spend the first half of the year adjusting to the new regulation.\u00a0</p><p>In the absence of federal action in Washington last year, other states are considering their own privacy legislation. The tech industry is closely watching states like New York and Washington, which could adopt their own privacy legislation in the coming months. \u00a0</p><p>This flurry of activity at the state level is prompting the industry's lobbying groups to invest more in states, Axios's Kim Hart and Margaret Harding McGill write. States are also expected to take a greater role on issues such as autonomous vehicles and facial recognition.\u00a0</p><p>             4. Tech giants' power and size will be under the microscope as antitrust investigations heat up at the federal and state level. \u00a0          </p><p>Antitrust will continue to dominate the tech policy debate, especially as the House subcommittee leading an antitrust investigation into Big Tech plans to release a report on its findings in the first half of 2020.\u00a0</p><p>The action on the Hill comes as the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department have their own ongoing probes of the tech giants, and states attorneys general are also launching investigations of companies including Facebook and Google.\u00a0</p><p>Any developments in these investigations could become a key topic on the campaign trail. Many Democratic candidates have been weighing in on their positions on breaking up Big Tech as they try to differentiate their economic platforms.\u00a0</p><p>             5. The industry's treatment of contract workers will face a reckoning           -           starting with a law targeting gig-economy workers known as AB5 in California. \u00a0          </p><p>Companies like Uber, Lyft and Postmates built entirely new business models by relying heavily on contract workers to power their driving and delivery workforces. But a new law in California that aims to reclassify these gig workers as full-time employees could pose an existential threat to that way of doing business.\u00a0</p><p>AB5 took effect last week, and the companies are stepping up their efforts to ensure that they don't have to reclassify their drivers. My colleague Faiz Siddiqui this morning\u00a0reports that Uber has launched an internal initiative known as \"Project Luigi\" to fight the law. The initiative aimed to revamp aspects of the app to make it more friendly to California drivers, including adding the ability to see estimated trip fares up front and then reject a trip without penalty.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Uber and Postmates sued California to challenge the legislation on the grounds that it \"violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process because of how it targets some workers and companies.\" They're also pushing a ballot initiative to counter the law in California in 2020.\u00a0</p><p>You are reading              The Technology 202          , our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.</p><p>             BITS: Analysts and former U.S. officials warn that Iran could retaliate against a U.S. airstrike that killed one of its top generals with a variety of cyberattacks,\u00a0my colleagues Tony Romm, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Craig Timberg report. The potential attacks could hit a number of critical sectors, including the energy industry and American banking systems, experts warn.</p><p>\"Anywhere where they can cause serious, almost psychological effects, noticeable disruption,\" is a target, John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis for the cybersecurity company FireEye, told my colleagues. \"The purpose is to prove to the public that they can reach out and touch Americans.\"\u00a0</p><p>Since the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, experts tracking disinformation efforts have noticed suspicious activity from accounts pushing pro-Iran messaging on social media and messaging apps, presenting another possible proxy for cyberwar. Researchers found that social media accounts formerly used for commercial reasons, for instance, had quickly been repurposed for coordinated pro-Iran messaging. Researchers witnessed similar coordinated messaging on the messenger app Telegram.</p><p>Lawmakers are also concerned. \"We know that Iranian cyberoperations are currently scoping and preparing to attack our networks - in all sectors of society - to see where they can hit us,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>             NIBBLES: Users have flooded TikTok with political content in recent weeks, despite the Chinese-owned app's effort to avoid the limelight of the 2020 social media race,\u00a0Georgia Wells and Emily Glazer at the Wall Street Journal report. Videos tagged with #Trump2020 were viewed more than 200 million times in the last three weeks of 2019, they found.\u00a0</p><p>TikTok banned political ads last year, but advisers from both parties have expressed interest in partnering with influencers on the app to reach young voters. The Trump campaign does not maintain an official page, but it has reached out to influential accounts on the platform, a person familiar with the matter told the Journal.</p><p>U.S. agencies are\u00a0ramping\u00a0up warnings that the Chinese-owned app could pose a national security threat. The Democratic National Committee issued a notice last month warning campaigns that the app could potentially be sending data back to the Chinese government and advising campaigns not to use it. The Republican National Committee did not respond to a request for comment from the Journal.</p><p>             The Trump administration today is implementing greater restrictions on U.S. companies seeking to export some location technologies for drones, sensors and satellites,             Alexandra Alper at Reuters reports.             \u00a0The rule aims to keep sensitive U.S. developments in artificial intelligence out of the hands of rival states such as China.          </p><p>\"They want to keep American companies from helping the Chinese make better AI products that can help their military,\" James Lewis, a technology expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters. The rule will probably be welcomed by industry leaders who feared a much wider crackdown on artificial intelligence products, Lewis noted.\u00a0</p><p>The rule, which stems from a 2018 mandate tasking the Commerce Department with regulating the export of sensitive technologies, follows growing bipartisan frustration with the\u00a0administration's slow rollout of export controls. The Commerce Department has introduced similar controls for advanced telecommunications equipment.</p><p>          - CES kicks off Tuesday, and attendees can expect a keynote address by Ivanka Trump and attempts to rebrand facial identification technology as consumer friendly, my colleague Heather reports. This is also the first year the 50-year-old event will allow sex toys onto its vendor show floor. Not present this year will be previous CES winners Ezviz and iFlytek. Ezviz's parent company Hikvision and iFlytek are blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department over their alleged use in human rights violations by the Chinese government.\u00a0which are blacklisted by the U.S. Commerce Department over their alleged use in human rights violations by the Chinese government.</p><p>\u00a0Correction: This item has been updated to reflect that Ezviz's parent company Hikvision, not Ezviz, is blacklisted by the Commerce Department.          </p><p>             - More news from the private sector:          </p><p>             - News from the public sector:          </p><p>             -\u00a0 Tech news generating buzz around the Web:          </p><p>             - Coming up:          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-8711df8c20ff4ef988e9fa3a4914d3e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXD-C2M1-DXKP-J4D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1934\"/><timeReceived>1:55 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;
