But a survey released on Monday showed that more than half of such investors would not be interested in the funds, as they worried about losing money. </p><p>\"The key concern is probably the lock-up period,\" said Kevin Leung, executive director of investment strategy at Haitong International Securities, referring to the funds' requirement that investors must keep their money invested for three years. </p><p>He noted that some people may consider the share prices of the big Chinese tech firms listed overseas to be too expensive and they may have missed the period of rapid growth in these companies. With the lock-up period they would not be able to freely exit their investment if it was not achieving the returns they wanted. </p><p>The survey of 7,500 retail investors by Sina Finance found that only 44.8 per cent said they would be interested in investing. </p><p>The six listed open-ended funds would be allowed to become strategic investors in CDR issues by hi-tech firms, according to the official website of the regulator, the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). </p><p>Several of China's top tech firms, including smartphone maker Xiaomi, internet conglomerate Baidu and e-commerce giant Alibaba are poised to issue CDRs soon, after Beijing asked regulators to come up with a vehicle through which individual investors could access companies whose shares are listed overseas. Current capital control rules restrict Chinese retail investors from directly trading in overseas markets. </p><p>Xiaomi could issue the first CDR in China as early as July 9, sources close to the company have said. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2149849/xiaomi-set-float-chinese-shares-early-july\">Xiaomi set to float Chinese shares in early July</url></p><p>But for investors, many of the details of how the CDR scheme will work are missing. </p><p>Key questions include how much cash CDRs would divert away from the existing markets - these have already fallen on concerns that money would flow out of stocks into CDRs. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has dropped for three consecutive days, and touched the lowest level for the year to date on Monday, at 3,037.9. Shenzhen's ChiNext Index, which tracks mainland China listed tech firms, has lost more than 3.3 per cent in the past three trading days, closing at 1,688.6 on Monday. </p><p>Other uncertainties are whether the CDRs could be converted into securities on offshore markets, and how the prices of the CDRs are to correlate with those of the overseas-listed stocks. </p><p>The CSRC has said it would \"strictly manage the fundraising scale and pace\" by stringently selecting eligible companies. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2135572/chinas-overseas-listed-tech-giants-top-talks-trading\">China's overseas-listed tech giants in top talks for trading homecoming</url></p><p>But other analysts said that the CDR scheme has yet to earn its stripes among market participants. </p><p>\"The best tech firms should not be picked by the CSRC. They should be picked by the market. Otherwise the pricing would be always distorted,\" said Liu Shengjun, head of the China Financial Reform Institute in Shanghai. </p><p>In a sign that the CSRC may have taken note of some of the concerns, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Beijing News</emphasis> reported on Monday that the regulator had slashed the fundraising target for the mutual funds by more than a half, to 20 billion yuan (US$3.1 billion) maximum each from 50 billion yuan. The minimum amount remained unchanged at 5 billion yuan. </p><p>Alibaba owns the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">South China Morning Post</emphasis>. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2018.

Instead, after a costly war for market share on the streets of urban China, they have been driven into the arms of the country\u2019s technology giants, or out of business altogether, leaving a few survivors trying to turn a profit.</p><p>China\u2019s big cities are still peppered with these colourful, dockless bikes, ready to be hired with a scan of a QR code. But the market has been severely chastened, both by the flawed economics of the industry\u2019s business model and by local authorities, who are responding to public anger about the civil cost of flooding the pavements with bikes.</p><p>Having spent billions and grabbed global headlines in their bid for market share, China\u2019s surviving bike-sharing apps are now under pressure from regulators and investors to clean up.</p><p>Consumer demand rises</p><p>More consumers are taking advantage of this relatively cheap transport option. The latest survey of 1,000 consumers by FT Confidential Research found 82 per cent of urban Chinese consumers used shared bikes over the past six months, up from 79 per cent two years ago, when competition was at its most intense. The number of users saying they ride such bikes as part of their daily commute increased to 41 per cent from 31 per cent.</p><p>Hellobike, which is backed by Alibaba\u2019s Ant Financial, is now the leading bike-sharing service in China, chosen by 35 per cent of users, up from just 2 per cent in 2017. Those opting for Mobike, which was acquired by delivery giant Meituan-Dianping for $2.7bn, fell slightly to 29 per cent. Ofo, which has also received investment from Ant but now faces an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e7da9b6-037c-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1\"> uncertain future</url>, was chosen by just 9 per cent, down from nearly 30 per cent two years ago.</p><p>Pushed towards profitability</p><p>There are now an estimated 1.5m shared bikes on the streets of Beijing, down from 2.4m two years ago. The city government removed nearly 400,000 shared bikes in the first half of this year alone and plans to reduce bike numbers by another 500,000 in the second. At least 58 city governments have taken punitive action against bike-sharing operators so far this year, including caps on how many bikes can be deployed.</p><p>The crackdown has forced operators to cut their cash burn, slim down and focus on efficiencies. Half an hour on a Mobike in Shanghai now costs Rmb2 ($0.30), double last year\u2019s rate, while Hellobike\u2019s equivalent price has increased from Rmb1 to Rmb2.5.</p><p>Consumers have generally accepted the increases. Just 30 per cent of respondents said they were using the services less or had stopped altogether, compared with the 53 per cent who either said higher prices had no impact or were unaware that prices had risen at all.</p><p>We estimate that a Mobike now needs to be ridden 0.8 times a day to break even, down from 1.2 times a day before prices were raised. The Beijing government says Mobikes were used an average of 1.7 times a day in the first half of this year, suggesting services in the capital are making a profit. Mobike\u2019s overall losses narrowed in the second quarter thanks to its shrinking number of bicycles and higher prices. Hellobike chief executive Li Kaizhu has reportedly said his business made a profit in more than 100 cities last year and could be profitable as a whole this year.</p><p>Enter the tech giants</p><p>Like so much of China\u2019s internet economy, this market has been shaped by the intervention of the country\u2019s big technology companies. Mobike\u2019s active user numbers increased 200 per cent after the service was included as a \u201cmini app\u201d in Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous WeChat platform in April 2017. Tencent is a backer of Meituan and played a key role in its acquisition of Mobike. One year after Ant invested in Hellobike, nearly 60 per cent of orders for the service come from the Alipay mini-app, according to research firm QuestMobile. </p><p>The financial backing of big technology companies also\u00a0removes uncertainty surrounding user deposits, which has become a key question after a cash crunch at Ofo forced customers to wait for their funds, and after the collapse of several operators. Now in the arms of Meituan, Mobike no longer requires customer deposits, while Hellobike\u2019s deposit requirements are linked to the Sesame Credit scores supplied by Ant. Asked what factors influence their choice of bike-sharing app, 41 per cent of consumers cited low deposit requirements, up from just 29 per cent two years ago.</p><p>Resistance to big tech appears futile. Although the company\u2019s founders were reluctant, Mobike found it hard to say no to a deal with Tencent-backed Meituan. Although Meituan pledged to keep the founders on board and preserve the brand, the company is encouraging Mobike orders to flow through Meituan\u2019s own app, while Meituan Bikes are slowly replacing Mobikes on the streets. Mobike\u2019s founders have since left the company.</p><p>Ofo presents a case study of what to expect going it alone. The company was set on remaining independent, rejecting an offer to merge with Mobike, an acquisition offer from Didi and a co-operation agreement with Ant Financial. This left Ofo without any of the financial and technology support that the embrace of China\u2019s big technology companies can bring.\u00a0Ofo is now in retreat, reining in its ambitious domestic and global expansion plans and unable to compete with the newly acquired Mobike and the Ant-powered Hellobike.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scout.asia/en-gb/\"> scoutAsia</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> is a corporate data and news service from Nikkei and the FT, providing in-depth information about more than 660,000 companies across more than 20 countries in east Asia, south Asia and Asean.

This is FIRST MOVE and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Slowing down. China sees a drop in new coronavirus infections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vision mixed. SoftBank profits plunging 99 percent as WeWork and Uber investments weigh.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And fixing the fold. Samsung hopes consumers and investors flip out over its new phone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Wednesday. Let's make a move.</p><p>A warm welcome once again to our FIRST MOVErs all around the globe. Great to be with you.</p><p>New Hampshire Democrats are feeling the burn today from Bernie and Buttigieg and I have to say Wall Street bulls are pretty fired up, too. Let me walk you through what's been happening.</p><p>U.S. futures solidly higher once again, as you can see after the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ closed at fresh record highs yesterday. The Dow, the relative underperformer, the Boeing burden continues. No orders last month and tech regulation fears I think are taking some of the heat out of Microsoft yesterday, too.</p><p>Meanwhile, stocks in Europe also hitting record highs. Asia also had a good session, too. The Shanghai Composite advancing for the fifth straight session. Asian stocks had a good session, too.</p><p>India as you can see, up from eight tenths of one percent. Thailand up one percent. Investors it seems willing to rely on Central Bank stimulus to offset any broader coronavirus and growth risks here.</p><p>Well, that was the message from Fed Chair, Jay Powell. He said the Fed stands ready to act if the virus endangers the U.S. expansion. Don't need to do anything, he says just yet. Back on Capitol Hill today for more testimony. So we will be watching that -- soothing words though from Central Banks clearly helping the mood in the bond markets, too.</p><p>Take a look at the U.S. 10-year yields, back up over 1.6 percent today bouncing off those five-month lows and the other big safe haven play, the U.S. dollar sitting near four-month highs.</p><p>The economic bulls will be closely watching this dollar strength of course, could pressure profits for U.S. multinationals in next earnings season.</p><p>All right, let's get to the drivers. China reporting its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since January on Wednesday. The count still rising though: 1,100 deaths and 45,000 infections have been confirmed.</p><p>Thousands of people remain stranded on cruise ships. Cases aboard the Diamond Princess in Tokyo continue to multiply, too. Another cruise ship carrying some 2,000 people has been turned away from four different ports.</p><p>David Culver joins me from Beijing, David, early days at this stage, but the suggestion it seems that we are seeing a degree of light at the end of the tunnel, how confident can we be at this stage, if at all?</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: With all of these numbers, Julia, we always have to consider the source. I mean, this is the Chinese government putting out this data. And that's really all we have to rely on here.</p><p>And they are certainly, here in state media, focusing heavily on these recent drops in the total number of reported cases. It's something that they deem as reflective of effectiveness for this containment effort, which in some cases, is a rather extreme containment effort that many folks are still living amidst the lockdown zones, tens of millions of people, in fact.</p><p>But the thing that we're going to be really looking forward to is this, really starting again of businesses, if you will, and that's going to be February 8th, where we're going to see tens of millions, rather 160 million is what they're projecting, who are going to be coming back to the major cities like Beijing, like Shanghai, and they're going to be getting back to work.</p><p>But Julia, what does that mean? It means people are going to be once again congregating in masses, so as to travel back to these major cities.</p><p>So that in of itself is a concern from a medical standpoint for exposure. But it's also not necessarily indicative that business is just going to resume as normal.</p><p>In fact, we know that even for some migrant workers, they don't even have jobs in some cases to come back to. And that's because if you look at, for example, one case, a family worked for an expat family, they evacuated.</p><p>So they simply have nothing to step back into and that is actually indicative of several different scenarios that we have heard from many migrant workers.</p><p>But all in all, it's going to be interesting to see if consumer confidence boost over the next week or so as well. That's something that's lagged here for obvious reasons. And quite frankly, folks still really aren't leaving their homes all that much.</p><p>I will say, you know, anecdotally driving even into work, you see more and more people with each passing day, but still not the crowds that you normally see here in Beijing -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it was interesting, I saw two different stories in the last several hours, one jd.com, the e-commerce giant saying that they're going to hire thousands of people to try and offset some of the impact here, which I think was an important thing.</p><p>But also that the Formula One that was going to be held has now been canceled and that pushes us into April, just to give you a sense of the cautiousness that's being still applied here.</p><p>When we're talking effectively two months out here with the idea of pulling masses of people together for a big event. There's still, to your point, a high degree of cautiousness at this stage and efforts to mitigate it going on.</p><p>[09:05:29]</p><p>CULVER: I think you're absolutely right. And part of that as well is looking at how the airlines have handled this. I mean, some of these airlines have gone to your point, into April.</p><p>So to say there's a light at the end of the tunnel -- that is certainly with Chinese state media wants to portray in many ways and perhaps they're right when it comes to this peak that's projected to be by one leading epidemiologist here in the next 10 days or so.</p><p>But there's also the reality of restarting everything and getting factories back to production and that's going to take time, weeks if not months.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, David Culver. Great to have you with us, as always. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>To our next driver now. SoftBank profits virtually wiped out, big losses from its massive tech fund dragged third quarter profits down by some 99 percent compared to the same quarter last year.</p><p>Sherrise Pham is in Hong Kong for us on this story. Sherrise, great to see you with us. I mean, I mentioned it at the top of the show, WeWork incredibly painful in this quarter; Uber, the papal losses for both of these things impacting, but it was a tale of two halves of course because Sprint in the last 24 hours, a good thing for SoftBank and their investment.</p><p>So talk us through the details here because it's complicated.</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes, day of contrast for SoftBank here, right? On the one hand, we've got their share price, climbing to a six-month high, closing up nearly 12 percent in Tokyo today on the back of that really positive news that the Sprint-T-Mobile merger is going to go through, a merger by the way that Masayoshi Son has been trying to engineer for years. That's a big albatross off of his neck.</p><p>But of course now, he is dealing with the massive losses from the Vision Fund which continue to plague SoftBank's earnings.</p><p>Vision Fund reported $2 billion in operating losses. That was enough to completely wipe out the operating profit that was brought in by SoftBank's telecom carrier unit.</p><p>So really, not a good sign for Masa Son and he was saying, look, the Uber losses and the WeWork losses are still painful and for the first time today, he also acknowledged reports and admitted that these recent losses to the Vision Fund are going to have effect on his next mega tech fund. Have a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MASAYOSHI SON, CEO, SOFTBANK (through translator): The WeWork challenges and Uber challenges for example, our share prices went down since IPO of Uber for example.</p><p>Due to those unexpected events, we have cast a concern amongst potential investors for SoftBank Vision Fund 2.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHAM: Unexpected events he called it there. I think some analysts would disagree with him on that and that a lot of people were foreseeing that WeWork was a troubled company, before SoftBank was pumping billions of dollars into it and driving the valuation of that company sky high.</p><p>And so what was he talking about there, though? The Vision Fund 2 now in danger of losing some of those potential investors.</p><p>Let's remind folks of who some of those potential investors were. There were some big names. They included Microsoft, iPhone builder Foxconn Technology, Apple itself, as well as Standard Chartered.</p><p>We reached out to all of those companies, most either declined to comment or they did not respond to a comment. But Masa Son coming out himself and saying these guys are rethinking their investment because the Vision Fund performance has spooked them and made them very, very concerned about the performance of his company and his fund -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, it makes sense. It makes perfect sense to me. I mean, even just the Sprint, the idea of what was achieved in the last 24 hours and there is a dichotomy of the disappointing investments, and this was one of those, let's be clear,.</p><p>But that the shift, I believe, $44 billion off the balance sheet, so that at least in the short term is helpful, but to your point about the complications of trying to raise another fund here and perhaps some pressure here from investors.</p><p>Elliott Management, the activist investment, openly building up a stake in SoftBank here, perhaps, to push for change here and some reassessment of how the Vision Fund and how SoftBank decides to make these kind of investments.</p><p>What do we think of that and what do we think SoftBank ultimately thinks of that?</p><p>PHAM: Son did address that today. He kind of alluded to it in the earnings presentation, but then he was directly asked about it in the Q&amp;A, which is always the spicier part of these presentations, I will say.</p><p>And he said, look, I agree with Elliot Management that our shares are grossly undervalued and he said that he met with Elliot Management about two weeks ago and they're on the same page regarding a couple of things. That includes a buyback and also increased transparency.</p><p>At the moment, SoftBank's Board only has two independent directors. He says he agrees with Elliot that they need more independent directors, and they already were having talks with people and are going to announce candidates very soon.</p><p>But one place where there seems to be a little bit of friction is also what kind of a buyback, how big it will be and the timing of it.</p><p>I believe, the reported buyback that Elliot is pushing for is somewhere between $10 billion and $20 billion. It seems really unlikely that SoftBank is going to want to initiate that kind of a buyback at that level especially considering how much trouble he's having now trying to fund Vision Fund 2.</p><p>So it will be a little bit of a wait and see, but we are in for more of a long ride with this one -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I think we can call that a clash of the titans, quite frankly. It's going to be an interesting one to watch.</p><p>Just a quick point on this, Bernstein is saying that even with all the losses that we've seen from SoftBank, it's deeply undervalued.</p><p>The Vision Fund generated a rate of return of 24 percent through September of 2019. So, that's going to be an interesting point, perhaps for SoftBank and those guys to make. Sherrise Pham, thank you for joining us.</p><p>PHAM: Indeed. Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Always a pleasure. Let's move on. Senator Bernie Sanders winning the New Hampshire Primary after narrowly beating former Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar, though came in third after strong debate performances. Former Vice President Joe Biden ended up finishing in fifth place. He left for South Carolina even before the polls closed in New Hampshire.</p><p>Meanwhile, entrepreneur, Andrew Yang is ending his presidential campaign. Wow. What a night. Jessica Dean is live in Manchester, New Hampshire with all the details on this. Jessica, give us your views here because for some, it's about Bernie's relative win, it's the rise of Pete Buttigieg. But also Amy Klobuchar just in the last few days, too. Lots to discuss.</p><p>JESSICA DEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there's a lot of news coming out of New Hampshire this morning. I think you start with Bernie Sanders who secured that victory last night. His campaign very pleased with that, of course. He is a neighboring senator.</p><p>So there was some pressure on him to perform here. He you won it so soundly back in 2016, when he was running against Secretary Clinton at the time, so his campaign very pleased with that.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg, a mayor of a small town in the middle of the country, who no one had really heard of what -- a year ago -- really almost, you know, a very close second place there, and really is going to propel both of them forward into this next phase of the campaign, where we really build out into more diverse states.</p><p>And then, as you mentioned, Amy Klobuchar, of course, maybe the biggest surprise of the night that she finished so strongly here in New Hampshire. It was something that they were able to build on from Iowa and then into New Hampshire.</p><p>But you know, even her campaign, I think, was surprised at just how strong of a finish she had. We had some exit polling that CNN performed here showing just a high number of people who made their decision late in the game from that debate that happened last Friday until you know, where they went to vote yesterday.</p><p>So really in a concentrated amount of time, and that Amy Klobuchar was really able to benefit from that.</p><p>So what happens now, we move into Nevada. We move into South Carolina. We move into Super Tuesday -- all, you know, more diverse states, which Joe Biden's campaign is very, very excited about. They're ready for him.</p><p>Do they think that he can flex some muscle with more diverse populations like African-Americans support, Hispanic support, but as we move into Nevada, what's going to be an interesting thing to watch, healthcare of course has been a huge issue in this primary and the discussion between what is the best way forward to better the healthcare system?</p><p>What is going to be interesting is the unions out there and how they see -- they're very powerful -- how do they see healthcare?</p><p>And one of the most powerful unions out there, the culinary union has been circulating a flyer pointing out specifically Bernie Sanders and his Medicare-for-All policy saying that's not good for union workers, because union workers have fought so hard to get that healthcare in place and they say that that will be taking it away.</p><p>So there's going to be -- expect to hear a lot of discussion about that, especially from Pete Buttigieg, whose Medicare-for-All who want it, which is more of a public option. And then Bernie Sanders, of course on the other side, which is this massive overhaul of the healthcare system Medicare-for- All -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the fight for broader appeal here. Jessica Dean, great to have you with us. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right. Coming up after the break, Samsung adds a flip phone to its foldable range, bending over backwards to make them more durable.</p><p>Plus --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW YANG (D), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am the math guy and it is clear tonight from the numbers that we are not going to win this race.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The breakup of the Yang Gang -- what went wrong for this businessman's pitch for the presidency? Stay with us. We're back after this.</p><p>[09:18:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. We are still looking at like seeing a solidly higher open for U.S. stocks this morning as we count down to the start of the trading day on Wall Street. All the major averages look set to make fresh records this morning.</p><p>We are higher by a half a percent as you can see premarket; that of course despite the coronavirus freeze. February is turning out to be the best month on Wall Street since June of last year. All the major averages are up some three percent or more for the month so far.</p><p>Big tech also in focus once again. Shares of Microsoft and Facebook falling over two percent Tuesday on reports that the U.S. is ramping up its antitrust investigation of some of these major tech firms.</p><p>Meanwhile, ratings agency Fitch warns that while we know the coronavirus will slow China's growth, the scale of the impact won't be clear for some time yet.</p><p>Brian Coulton is Chief Economist at Fitch Ratings and joins us now. Brian, great to have you with us.</p><p>The interesting thing here is you are looking potentially and seeing an outright decline in China's real GDP for the first quarter of 2020, and we're talking on a quarter on quarter basis. I mean, that's unprecedented.</p><p>BRIAN COULTON, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FITCH RATINGS: We've got data going back to the early 90s in China for sequential GDP growth and we can't find our negative numbers.</p><p>So this is really kind of uncharted waters -- uncharted waters for the world economy. You know, we've always been talking about a slow growth scenario in China, but actually, the Chinese economy is shrinking even for one quarter is going to be a really big deal for the rest of the world.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What does that mean on an economic basis, but also on a psychological basis to your point, fine, you know, we've only got data back going 40 years or so -- modern Chinese economic history, but the impact of that I don't think we can underestimate.</p><p>[09:20:10]</p><p>COULTON: There's been a complete transformation in the impact of China on the world economy since the SARS outbreak in 2003. China's GDP is now something like 18 percent of the global total, up from five percent back then, it's now 50 percent of metals demand, huge share of global auto demand, 25 percent of the global auto market. And it's been accounted for a third of global growth.</p><p>So, you know, any given shock to China is going to have a much bigger impact than we had back then, and what we saw over the last 18 months, two years in the world economy, China slowed down because they were focusing on deleveraging or derisking the financial sector that had a really big fallout on global growth, particularly in the Eurozone.</p><p>So this is going to matter. You know, we used to say when I first started working on the world economy, when the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold and it's a bit of an unfortunate simile.</p><p>But you know, that's the case now for China. It really is having a huge impact on everything else.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you're talking at this stage a worst case scenario for Chinese GDP in 2020 of just above five percent. You know, we often joke about the structural setup in China that they can kind of decide what the GDP number is going to be at the beginning of the year.</p><p>So what does that mean, that five percent or 5.2 percent in terms of your assessment actually mean in practice here for China, because the automatic assumption here is they will be stimulating like crazy to support the economy.</p><p>COULTON: I mean, that scenario assumes that the panic and the disruption goes on right through March. And you know, there's been some better numbers in recent days that you know, the number of new cases has slowed down. So maybe that's a bit of a harsh assumption.</p><p>But if we do get disruption right the way through to March into the second quarter, then we could be looking at year-on-year growth in Q1 close to three percent.</p><p>Now three percent is a sort of number that we've all been looking at when we've been trying to assess the impact of a hard landing in China.</p><p>So I think that number would really generate a very strong response from the government in terms of easing fiscal policy, trying to boost infrastructure.</p><p>So we would get a very sharp bounce back in the second half of the year, and that's why I think we'd still probably be looking at numbers around five percent or slightly above, even in that worst case scenario.</p><p>So I don't think it's a question of massaging the numbers, I think it's a question of them, three percent will be well outside their comfort zone, and they would not want the economy to grow that slowly. So they would really push the accelerator in terms of trying to get growth back up in the second half of the year. And I think they have got the levers to achieve that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That's such a great point. It's the comfort level with the numbers and the economic output that we're seeing here.</p><p>I do want to ask you about your decision at the back end of last year to lower the rating and the outlook on Hong Kong in particular. The authorities there said your assessment of the situation was incorrect.</p><p>You were concerned about the institutional set up, the rule of law, the impact that potentially could have on the business community.</p><p>In reflection, do you remain happy with the rating and the outlook that you have in Hong Kong or has anything changed? Because we haven't seen businesses shifting out to the region. They still look at it as an opportunity and a conduit in and out of China.</p><p>COULTON: We never said that it would affect Hong Kong in that sort of way. It was about the linkage between Hong Kong and China becoming much stronger over time, and so the gap between the two ratings was looking stretched.</p><p>We have seen the Hong Kong economy already into recession because of the impacts of the social unrest on the economy. And now this China shock is going to make things worse.</p><p>So in terms of the macro economic situation, though, it's really looking quite soft for Hong Kong at the moment.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Brian, fantastic to have your insight. Brian Coulton, Chief Economist at Fitch Ratings. Thank you for that.</p><p>Now, one of China's biggest e-commerce firms is taking on workers who have been laid off because of the coronavirus.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier on the show, jd.com says it is opening up 20,000 new positions mainly for warehouse workers, couriers and drivers. Now, some of the jobs are temporary, but online shopping has seen a boom as people in medical quarantine order goods from home.</p><p>All right, let's turn our attention now to South Korea where Samsung is having another go at making a foldable smartphone, it's called the Galaxy Z Flip and it folds into a square.</p><p>Its first folding phone, the Galaxy Fold came out last year, if you remember, but early reviewers said it didn't work so well and it broke easily.</p><p>Samantha Kelly has one of the new phones. She has actually tried it out. This is very exciting. Sam, what do we think of this phone? Have they managed to get away from that awkward history with their first attempt?</p><p>SAMANTHA KELLY, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR: Right. So yesterday was a big day for the company out in San Francisco where it announced its new S20 flagship smartphones.</p><p>But to your point, everybody is talking about the Z Flip phone. So we have one here, it comes out tomorrow in stores.</p><p>And basically it's much smaller than the first version, which kind of opened like a book. This is a clamshell design here, totally new design, new hinge which was one of the big problems that we saw with the first version with them breaking and the screen flickering.</p><p>Now we've only had this for a little bit, so we can't really test the battery and how well the hinge will hold up.</p><p>But I really like the new design. It's much sturdier and what I really like is there's so many big smartphones these days. Everything is big.</p><p>But this is definitely a throwback to the original flip phones that we saw years and years ago where it's smaller, so it's much easier to throw into a bag.</p><p>There's also a small display on the front, too, so you can get running notifications. But what I really like too, is you know, we're so used to having a smartphone, flash notifications and glow when we get something in, and this is sort of a way to kind of close that.</p><p>So we'll see whether or not how this stacks up in reviews, but it's certainly a nice form factor here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And $600.00 cheaper than the Galaxy Fold as well. So I am sure people will like that.</p><p>KELLY: Oh my goodness.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's going to be interesting to see. Samantha Kelly, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that assessment of the phone available tomorrow.</p><p>KELLY: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much for that. All right, we're counting down to the market open. We are set to see fresh record highs for the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 as you can see. We're adding to the gains we were seeing just 15 minutes ago.</p><p>The market open is next and it looks like we're going to go. Stay with us. You're first FIRST MOVE.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live from New York. That was the opening bell over at the New York Stock Exchange and U.S. stocks are in rally mode this morning.</p><p>The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ as we anticipated making fresh all-time highs early on in the session here. The Dow also on track for a record close.</p><p>Traders will be monitoring Fed Chair Jay Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill. Of course, he spoke yesterday saying that the Fed would take action if the impact of the coronavirus threatens U.S. growth going forward.</p><p>In the meantime, take a look at what's going on in energy prices. Oil strengthening for a second straight day, significantly actually. A bounce back here.</p><p>China has reported its lowest daily number of fresh coronavirus cases since January and we saw OPEC today drastically cutting its outlook for oil demand in 2020.</p><p>Now, you'd expect that to have the reverse reaction in the oil markets, but I have to say, I think that's pretty much baked into the price right now, of course. Just two days ago, oil was trading at one-year lows.</p><p>What about a look now at our Global Movers. Shares of Shopify rallying to all-time highs. The Canadian e-commerce company reporting stronger than expected Q4 earnings. It's also raising its 2020 outlook as you can see, up some 17 percent, just shy of -- Shopify there.</p><p>Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond shares tumbling. The popular home furnishing retailer warning that sales slowed by a greater than expected rate in December and January Wow. Down some 26 percent.</p><p>Lyft shares also under pressure, down more than six and a half percent. Uber's ride sharing rival says revenue topped $1 billion for the first time in Q4. But Lyft says it won't be profitable until 2021. That's around a year later than Uber says they can get there.</p><p>Uber shares as you can see, little changed in the session.</p><p>All right, let's leave the ride hailing race behind and go on to a fresh race here and we're talking about the race to the White House.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders scoring a victory in Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire narrowly holding off a challenge from Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our campaign is not just about beating Trump, it is about transforming this country.</p><p>[CHEERING]</p><p>SANDERS: It is about having the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military industrial complex.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It was a bad night for Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden, too.</p><p>CNN Senior Political Analyst, David Gergen joins us now. David, fantastic to have you with us on the show. We can talk about Bernie Sanders and the implications of what we saw in that vote last night.</p><p>But I do want to talk about the stunning demise, it seems of Joe Biden and the support that he is getting. He predicted that he would lose here and he'd already moved on. Are we looking at the end game here for Joe Biden?</p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you, Julia, for inviting me on. I do think he's in deep, deep trouble now. And the most important story of the campaign so far has been the near collapse of Joe Biden.</p><p>He was the front runner everyone counted on him to take the fight to Trump. He's finished fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire.</p><p>You know, I wonder, I must tell you, you know, the Trump folks were going after him and Ukraine, they wanted to smear him. I wonder whether the controversies over his son and over his own personal relationship with things in Ukraine wound up weakening him as a candidate in this race.</p><p>Whether, in fact the Trump people got what they wanted after all. So we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>I would tell you as well, Julia that it's also true that Joe Biden is not campaigning for the Presidency. It has not been his forte. This is his third time seeking the presidency. He has yet to win a primary or a caucus.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting what it does do therefore is potentially open up the center ground. I mean, we saw voters going for Pete Buttigieg here. Amy Klobuchar's rise even just since the debate that we saw last week has been quite fascinating hereto.</p><p>But then, of course, you've got the wild card here, which is Mike Bloomberg. What do we think here and what do we think is acceptable to the party? And we'll leave Bernie Sanders out of it for a second and we'll come back to that.</p><p>GERGEN: Well, I do think that Bernie Sanders has become the front runner. But uneasy rest of the crown. He after all, again four years ago when he won New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton. He won it massively. He won by 20 points.</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>GERGEN: This time, he won by two points and the turnout was not particularly good. But very importantly, as you said, the departure of Biden has opened up this moderate lane and what was interesting last night is, if you add up all the people who voted for say the progressive far left candidates versus those who voted for the moderate left candidates.</p><p>The moderate left drew the most votes by about 52 percent of voters went for the more moderate candidates, and about 36 percent of the voters went for the far right or far left, I'm sorry, progressives.</p><p>So that explains why there is this open invitation -- maybe not an invitation but why Mike Bloomberg is gaining strength.</p><p>He is a person, of course with enormous ability here. Here in New York, he was elected to Mayor three times, and he has formidable strengths, including his resources. And very, very interestingly, a poll last week showed that in head on heads among the Democrats who are now still in the race against Trump, Mike Bloomberg has the biggest lead against Trump. It is a nine-point lead according to a Quinnipiac poll.</p><p>That quite -- it took me aback because I didn't think he'd come that far that fast.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, you know, CNN's polling shows that by and large, Democrats here are saying, look, we do ultimately want someone that can take the fight to Donald Trump here, that can beat Donald Trump rather than necessarily somebody who we agree with all their policies.</p><p>I just want to pull in what Elizabeth Warren said in congratulation for the win here for Bernie Sanders and the sort of dig that was implied. Just listen to this for a second.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE If we're going to beat Donald Trump in November, we are going to need huge turnout within our party and to get that turnout, we will need a nominee that the broadest coalition of our party feels like they can get behind.</p><p>[CHEERING]</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And this for me is the question about Bernie Sanders here. Yes, he got 25 percent, but it is what -- only a quarter of the votes here and how does that support translate on a more national level for voters? For the Democratic Party themselves?</p><p>The views that others that have worked with him in D.C. and say, this is not a person that unites, in fact, he's not achieved much since his time in Washington. It's been a long while. What do we think of this guy's popularity on a nation basis?</p><p>GERGEN: On paper, you would think that if Bernie Sanders wins a few more, he would be a front runner and be almost impossible to stop.</p><p>But as you suggested, Julia, the pros in the Democratic Party are frightened of a Bernie Sanders candidacy. He is an avowed socialist, and America has a long history of opposing socialism being much less, you know, going all the way back to the 1920s.</p><p>We've been much less receptive to a socialist. We never had a socialist party in the United States. You look across Western Europe, and most of the countries there have had socialist parties, still have socialist parties. But that's been a never to the United States.</p><p>So, when you take the long view, it's just hard to imagine Bernie Sanders emerging as the nominee, but he is on a better track than he has ever been before.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So that's a title he can take at this stage, the most popular socialist in America, quite what he can do with that remains to be seen.</p><p>GERGEN: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you so much.</p><p>GERGEN: Stay tuned, Julia. Glad to see you this morning.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Likewise, sir. Thank you. All right, we're going to take a quick break.</p><p>But up next, the Spotify of the Middle East. The co-founder of the music streaming app, Anghami will be here. He says he welcomes competition from Western rivals. Stay with us. We're back after this.</p><p>[09:42:01]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Meet the Spotify of the Middle East. Dubai-based Anghami is the leading music streaming app in the Middle East and North Africa. It boasts 73 million users, a library of 31 million songs and a billion streams a month.</p><p>Now Bloomberg reports the company is considering a sale which could value it up to $400 million. I'm joined now by Elie Habib, he is Anghami's founder.</p><p>Elie, fantastic to have you on the show. You've revolutionized digitized music consumption in the Middle East and North Africa. Talk to me about what your company ultimately is doing? How it works and why you're not worried by some of the big competition that's now looking at the region?</p><p>ELIE HABIB, FOUNDER, ANGHAMI: Hello, Julia. Thank you for having me. Basically, you know, we had the dream, roughly eight years ago, that you know, the region has no legal streaming service.</p><p>I mean, we have absolutely no legal anything in terms of, you know, IP rights, whether it's books or movies or music. We thought that we, you know, locals could come up with an idea, you know, come up with a concept of streaming music in the region and get people to buy into that.</p><p>And you know, we had not that big of a dream in terms of numbers. We thought we're going to get, like maybe 300,000 users in the first year. And we eventually got a million in the first three months and after that, we realized we're onto something. And we kept growing.</p><p>Right now, looking at that, yes, we are growing where 2019 was our biggest year on records and you know, way more than what I could have expected. Hopefully, it validated the idea that when competition comes in, if you're properly armed, not just a local brand, because local helps, but if you have a good product and the local brands and local knowhow, understanding of what your users want, you can keep growing.</p><p>So yes, I'm not worried. I'm happy that there's competition because after all, competition breeds more creativity on our end.</p><p>And right now we're not exactly the same product like others in the region. But we're fighting to make sure that we remain the number one by far like we did in 2019.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What differentiates you? Because you do have a mix of local artists, of international artists? What kind of demand that you see for a mix of those products? And to your point, you say we're not exactly the same. Why aren't you? What are you doing differently?</p><p>HABIB: We started -- you know, when we started there was like no book to follow, right? For us, we understand that the user to actually to listen to music, to eventually get to pay to music need to believe in something. They need to believe that what it can do, the platform interacts with him in a way that would make sense for a user to pay.</p><p>[09:45:07]</p><p>HABIB: And we need to find ways that the user would pay without it being a credit card commitment.</p><p>People in the Middle East notoriously don't use credit cards online. You know, the biggest platforms like Amazon has I think 60 percent cash on delivery. In our case, you know, cash on delivery wouldn't work in the streaming world.</p><p>So one, we made sure that we're actually integrated with all the telcos in the Middle East. We currently integrate with 36 telcos, that's not exactly all, but that's most of what matters, right? Over 85 percent of active people in the in the region can subscribe via mobile operator on Anghami, which is kind of unique to everybody.</p><p>We provide, moreover, we don't just do Arabic, you know, or international, the people in the region listen to a mixture of both.</p><p>You would want to listen to Fairouz in the morning, and maybe some Britney Spears later when it's night, that's normal.</p><p>I mean, that's the kind of weird combination, but I've seen way worse than that, honestly. So we understand the user DNA, the user taste, and that took us many billions of streams for us to understand that and that's the differentiation that will require a lot of other competitors to take, you know, many years to actually get to the sense of understanding the users.</p><p>But for Anghami, we differentiate ourselves by our product. Our product is actually uniquely social, which is, you know, no other product has the features of Anghami in terms of social because we think that music streaming the way it was invented, originally, it was started from, you know, back from the Walkman and eventually to the iPod and all of -- and then eventually to Pandora and Spotify stopped over there.</p><p>We think that consumption in the music have to be different.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Elie, I am going to interrupt you. Forgive me for interrupting you, Elie, because I don't want to run out of time without asking you, but I love the point that you make about payments, because that was going to be one of my key questions is how do people pay when actually credit card penetration is so low? So I do think that's important.</p><p>Talk to me about potentially selling. I mentioned in the introduction about whether you're open to be bought by somebody, one of these competitors. Do you want to remain independent? Or are you having conversations and are you open to being bought at some price, at least?</p><p>HABIB: Yes, I mean, what's open for us is that we actually signed up JPMorgan to raise a fund, you know, to raise -- around funding. And since doing that we've gone -- we've been approached by multiple parties who are interested to buy -- to carve some equity or to buy out the entire company.</p><p>We're contemplating that. We've not decided. What's for sure for me is that I'm very much interested on how Anghami heads in. I mean, we're not going to sell out just to sell out. We want to actually make sure that Anghami keeps growing properly in the region.</p><p>And we're in a very comfortable place. We are one of the streaming services that are profitable. And that is kind of unique in the world of music streaming. And why? Because we know how to spend our money and how to grow and how to invest.</p><p>We think 2020 is going to be very big. Whether we are going to sell, I can't answer that right now because we haven't decided, but whether we're going to keep growing and doing more investments, for sure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Congratulations, Elie. Come back and talk to us soon. Fascinating. I've got plenty more questions for you. I can tell you. Elie Habib there, co-founder of music streaming app, Anghami. Great to have you with us.</p><p>HABIB: Thank you. Thank you for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right. Thank you. Still ahead, sharpening up the FAANGs. The FAANG stocks have been a fantastic way to track the growth in tech investment. Here on FIRST MOVE, though we can keep -- it might be time to consider expanding this pretty exclusive club. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:51:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back. U.S. President Donald Trump praising some of the big U.S. tech companies at the White House yesterday. He says four in particular are making corporate America great again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have four trillion companies. One is Microsoft, one is Apple. One is Google, one is Amazon.</p><p>So you have Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. And so you have an M, you have an A, you have a G and you have an M. You have MAGA --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: President Trump calls them the MAGA stocks. It's his variation on a group better known on Wall Street as the FAANGs. The FAANGs have been Wall Street's shorthand for the hottest U.S. tech names for years.</p><p>But with new global titans gunning for growth, maybe the FAANGs have become a bit long in the tooth. So FIRST MOVE has a plan to make the FAANGs great again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY (voice over): It's the exclusive club that the tech world obsesses over -- the FAANGs. Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. They've been members since 2013, then Apple joined the gang a few years later.</p><p>But with Tesla increasingly defined as more tech than tires, and Microsoft, a $1 trillion market cap Cloud colossus, maybe the FAANGs need a bit more bite.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN IVES, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: The FAANGs continue to be the Mount Rushmore of tech. I think right now, Tesla and Microsoft -- Microsoft being probably more front and center -- are the only two names that I could see in terms of expanding that FAANG definition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY (voice over): Perhaps a full throated FAANG overhaul is now in order.</p><p>Call them if you will, the FAANTAMs of Wall Street, all the original FAANGs plus the might of Musk and the riches of Redmond.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, Netflix, Tesla, Amazon and Microsoft, seven corporate bellwethers to better represent the tech titans of today.</p><p>The FAANTAMs might represent a strange new world for some, but perhaps one day, they'll get some tech world acclaim.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Paul La Monica joins me now. Look, Paul, that's my version of a mask. Little bit more high-end.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: On behalf of all your viewers, Julia, I'm glad that you went with that Andrew Lloyd Webber and not \"Cats.\"</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'll leave that to my colleague, Richard Quest, of course, I think. Let me move on quickly.</p><p>Paul, what do you think? FAANTAMs and then then we'll talk President Trump.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I mean, there is obviously more to this market momentum then those really large tech stocks that dominate the S&amp;P 500. Actually, the story earlier this week, calling them the S&amp;P Five essentially when you look at the market cap concentration in that index.</p><p>But of course, Tesla and Netflix also are extremely popular right now. You could throw in some of the international companies like Alibaba and Tencent as well, you know, that's why some people refer to the BATs in China -- Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.</p><p>So we all know that Wall Street loves acronyms and so does President Trump, obviously. But one thing with Trump here that I find curious, he has often taking potshots at these companies, particularly Amazon, the Jeff Bezos, \"Washington Post,\" and now he's praising them for their market milestones, because he is trying to make it about him and that he deserves the credit.</p><p>Not so sure about that, and remember, also, the F.T.C. is now looking at the acquisitions of all these companies. There's talk of potential breakups, so it's just very strange.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It is very strange. And this -- to the point though, it is the heart of innovation and success in corporate America and jobs are being created. So there is a balance to find here. It's just clearly a little bit difficult at the moment perhaps.</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, yes. Definitely. And obviously, I mean, we're going to see what happens with the Democrats with Bernie Sanders winning New Hampshire. He hasn't been a big fan of large tech companies either.</p><p>And, you know, will these companies have to get broken up? Will there be more taxes? You know, well, we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I think my other observation, hey, would be MAGA perhaps stands for Make Alphabet Google Again, because we still -- we keep calling it by the wrong name and --</p><p>LA MONICA: It's kind of like the coming to America joke. You know some people still call Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay. I think most people still call Alphabet, Google.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Please. I know time. Time to call it Alphabet. Anyway, Paul La Monica, thank you so much for playing with us. We have to go.</p><p>That just about wraps up the show. I like FAANTAMs. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours. We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020021201cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6F-S991-JB20-G1KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000D3XE</classCode><className>SAMSUNG GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS335220 MAJOR HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Data from KPMG showed that money poured into the sector throughout the world doubled to US$111.8 billion in 2018, driven by mega deals.<br/><br/>At a technology level, BoComm believes that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will enjoy sustained favor from investors throughout the year while KPMG expects blockchain technology to attract more capital on its execution over experimentation.<br/><br/>The fintech sector is also expected to see further consolidation as competition will become more intense, industry watchers have warned.<br/><br/>BoComm research noted that fewer new entrants joined the sector from 2016, with the number of newly registered companies dropping to 370, half of that in the peak year of 2015.<br/><br/>The growing partnerships between banks and fintech firms will also lead to more competition among fintech companies, according to industry watchers.<br/><br/>To extend financial ecosystems and the \u201ctouch points\u201d with their customers, lenders such as Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China Construction Bank and China Merchants Bank announced plans to develop open banking by working together with fintech allies.<br/><br/>Last year, a number of fintech firms recognized the opportunity of helping banks to comply and get ready for data sharing as well as customer acquisition and scaling.<br/><br/>Established participants will endeavor to become more competitive while new entrants will be looking to enter the lucrative market.<br/><br/>KPMG expects collaboration between fintechs and banks to grow further in a wider Asian region, particularly in areas such as \u201cKnow-Your-Customer,\u201d anti-money laundering and digital identity management, including facial recognition and voice recognition.<br/><br/>The mass user traffic owned by Chinese Internet majors has become increasingly attractive to commercial banks and reports from 21st Century Business Herald said some credit card segments would pay as much as 400 yuan (US$59.6) to acquire a potential card-holder from those giants.<br/><br/>Fintech companies are expected to allocate more resources to serve corporate clients. And there will be two main types of such service providers.<br/><br/>Companies such as Ant Financial, Tencent Holdings and Du Xiaoman Financial, a financial service unit split off from the search behemoth Baidu Inc, will function more like \u201cecosystem platforms,\u201d which will offer financial institutions comprehensive services including technological enablement as well as sharing their massive user traffic and rich business scenarios.<br/><br/>The other way out for fintech firms is to become leaders in technological development. They can help financial institutions access long-tail customers and assist them in building better connections with their clients through their competitive technologies, the BoComm\u2019s report added.<br/><br/>China Top Credit Inc, for instance, is a company that seeks the second type of growth path. The Shanghai-based firm is focused on offering financial information and services for the consumer finance industry, with participants from banks, securities houses, trust firms and big tech companies.<br/><br/>Last year, it launched a new business line to serve its enterprise clients.<br/><br/>Lin Shiyi, head of the business segment, told Shanghai Daily that such a move reflected their long-term strategy of becoming a pure tech company.<br/><br/>Lin anticipated that in the future, financial institutions like banks will shoulder more active management roles for their business while their fintech partners will be more likely to serve \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHADLY-8543220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHADLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR9-JVN1-JC5R-2056-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383971</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"689\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Shanghai Daily Publishing House</copyright><publicationName>Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 26, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Senate opening the impeachment trial of President Trump. We are looking at the next steps as tensions rise on Capitol Hill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we've got a big show this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining the conversation this morning, Moody's Capital Markets Chief Economist John Lonski is here, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Assistant Editorial Page Editor James Freeman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Welcome back.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, so China needed a deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, China needed a deal for sure.</p><p>The market keeps going up and up and up in the U.S. Record-breaking stories.</p><p>Once again, the market breaking through unchartered territory once again yesterday. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq ending the trading day in record territory with a powerful 267 point rally on the Dow, up 1 percent yesterday, 29,297 the close on the Dow yesterday. The S&amp;P was up 27 and the Nasdaq up almost 100 points, better than 1 percent, as markets fueled a -- were fueled by the signing of the phase one China trade deal and the Senate passing USMCA, as we told you about yesterday, as growth in the United States remains on an uptrend.</p><p>Over in China, it is reaching the lowest point in decades. Chinese economic growth slowing to 6.1 percent last year. We think it's 6.1 percent. That's what they tell us. Economists are blaming the big slowdown on trade pressure and tariffs.</p><p>What do you say, John?</p><p>JOHN LONSKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S CAPITAL MARKETS: There you go. I mean this is as expected. China was much more vulnerable to the imposition of tariffs and the trade war than the U.S. economy. It's showing up in the data. China has a very strong incentive to adhere to this phase one agreement as ambitious as it might be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: One thing I'll point out that we've got a record in the stock market here in the United States. Meantime, the Democrats are trying to remove President Trump from office. We will get to that in a second.</p><p>But there are some good numbers coming out of China. The Shanghai shipping index, which is export freight rates, suddenly jumped to the highest level since 2015. And this is a great -- probably a better leading indicator than economic growth.</p><p>\"The Wall Street Journal\" writes also about this. The price of copper is up more than 7 percent in the past two months. Again, in industrial metal used around the globe, another bellwether for global health.</p><p>And then all those surveys of purchasing managers in the Eurozone have shown continued weakness. New export orders have been going up in recent weeks. This is global growth. So, again, the market is telling you something about a global economy rebound.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Shipping is an incredibly important indicator.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so is copper. I totally agree.</p><p>LONSKI: And that is because of a reduction in trade risks, that's what you're seeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. And -- and --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and the same thing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: The market is moving. I mean we're seeing shipping across the world. That's -- that's an indicator of what's happening across the world.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I think another interesting indicator, you've been reporting this week on bank earnings, and you see within, especially those JP Morgan results, also Citigroup, some of the others, the business customer getting more optimistic, doing more investment deal making. I think that has a lot to do with these trade clouds being lifted. And if we're hoping for that return to really big capital expenditures, businesses making investments in new plant and equipment, I think the table is set for that now with this deal concluded.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I always like to look at the message of the market. And the message of the market right now is that this impeachment trial is going to be a big flop.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think if anybody really believed that President Trump was going to be taken out of office, we would not see Dow 29,000, we would not see money moving into stocks, if there was a real worry that policies were going to change. So I thing you have to look at the message of the market.</p><p>Now, anything can happen in the next couple of weeks in the Senate trial, but, of course, we will see about that.</p><p>Go ahead, John.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, this is very similar to Clinton's impeachment, late 1998 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.</p><p>LONSKI: Where the equity market took off and went through the roof.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Except Clinton wasn't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we were also on the doorstep of a new era with the dot com boom, but yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and Clinton wasn't up for re-election, which is another important point. But you've seen -- I -- we keep saying this on this program, but you cannot emphasize this enough, income inequality is shrinking in this country. You've seen a complete reversal in income growth where it's rank and file workers are seeing the greatest wage gains, not the rich. That this is a reversal of what was happened under President Obama.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it is really astonishing.</p><p>Steve Forbes talked about this yesterday, that there's been a sky-rocketing number of Latino businesses being formed. You have income growth in every metropolitan area in this country. Not a single one -- we haven't had that since the early 90's.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a great point.</p><p>Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts swearing in members of the Senate yesterday, marking the official beginning of the impeachment trial of President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, SUPREME COURT: I attend the Senate in conformity with your notice for the purpose of joining with you for the trial of the president of the United States.</p><p>Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trail of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?</p><p>SENATORS: I do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, this coming as the Government Accountability Office yesterday determined that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld aid to Ukraine and the White House slammed those findings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, James, oh the -- the hang ringing, oh, the GAO said it was illegal.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, illegal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The funds then eventually released. This is literally something that the left was hanging all of their chapeaus on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What, it -- well, you wrote -- I'm teeing it up for you because you got the --</p><p>FREEMAN: Thank you. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Best column in the op-ed page today.</p><p>FREEMAN: I was just enjoying your commentary for a moment.</p><p>But, yes, I've heard some media reports this morning calling GAO independent. It is not independent. This is a group of bureaucrats that works for the Congress. They works for legislators. In this case, a Democratic legislature, Chris Van Hollen in the Senate, asked them to opine, essentially asked them to agree with him that there was a violation of law here.</p><p>I've also heard that this is a non-partisan organization. Just for the record, the employees' union at the GAO is the IFPTE. In the 2016 election cycle, they gave 100 percent of their donations, this is their PAC, to Democrats. So, um, let -- let -- let's not --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God, 100 percent.</p><p>FREEMAN: Let's keep in perspective. There's also the point that this is not a ruling from a court. This is an opinion from some staff who work for members of Congress. And I think as the White House has pointed out, it's pretty hard to make the case there's a legal violation when the deadline was September 30th and the funds got released September 12th.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I -- let me point something out. If this new information, whether it's what Lev Parnas is saying, again, a credible witness, question mark, whether it's this Government Accountability Office report, this goes to the issue of Nancy Pelosi and co and co rushed the impeachment process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-huh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So if you -- rather than waiting and continuing to investigate, subpoena John Bolton, push it through the courts, they rushed it. And here's where we are. That rather than -- she has relinquished control of the impeachment process. They can say they're continuing to investigate all they want, but now the senators and the House brief are due by Saturday, tomorrow, at 5:00 p.m., POTUS brief due by noon on Monday. It commences on Tuesday.</p><p>Where we are now is, the Senate's in control. The Senate control by the Republicans. And they can do what they want. And there's a big move to just look at the evidence that's presented to them to half-baked articles of impeachment. The second one, an obstruction of Congress, which is simply the president standing up for the power of his office.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so that -- that's what's happening. They -- it's proof to the American people that it's purely political and the Democrats rushed it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I think people see through it and that's why we see the market performance that we're seeing. People understand that this is just a lot of politics.</p><p>We have a new member of the trillion dollar club. A little larger, that trillion dollar club. Google, parent company Alphabet, becoming the fourth company to surpass $1 trillion in market value, joining Apple, Amazon, Microsoft. The valuation helping push markets into record territory yesterday.</p><p>And so here you have, again, money moving into stocks, into technology, something that would not be happening if you expected that we were going to see taxes go higher, regulation become tighter and trade deals reversed. That is the trifecta of economic policy that this president instituted and has fueled markets.</p><p>FREEMAN: But I think it's also a warning for this president and -- and other leaders that given the value of these companies, these efforts to go after big tech, whether in the U.S. or we see it in Europe on the tax side, we see it in lots of countries on the privacy side, this is going to have a big market cost if -- if the world -- the world's governments decide to go after these companies in a big way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about censoring conservative conversation? What do you want to see happening? I mean shouldn't there be boundaries so that there can't be cheating around an election?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think the -- kudos to FaceBook for standing up to the crowd saying you need to start preventing banning editing political advertising. I think that -- that kind of censorship is not what we want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think -- and I also question whether a new regulator in Washington is going to deliver the balance that people may want as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it -- but this one -- this trillion dollar number on Google, it puts a bullseye on their back --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A target on their back in terms of the Democrats. They will get hammered over and over again by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, assuming they're not fighting with one another.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Uh-huh.</p><p>LONSKI: One thing to remember, $1 trillion is about 5 percent of U.S. GDP. If you have $2 trillion companies, that's 10 percent of GDP. That's mindboggling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, that really is --</p><p>LONSKI: It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you put it that way, John, you're right.</p><p>All right, we are just getting started this morning. We've got a lot coming up.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi versus FaceBook. The House speaker slamming the social media giant for what she says is misleading the American people.</p><p>Then, from combat to company. One veteran-owned company making flip-flops and other footwear for men and women. We've got that story there.</p><p>And then historic auction. President John F. Kennedy's belongs on the block today. We have some of those items right here on set. Wait till you see that.</p><p>But we'll slip in a short break.</p><p>And then former White House Strategist Steve Bannon is here talking all things impeachment to 2020 and a Justice Department investigation into leaks. Yes, they are looking at Jim Comey. We've got that new information. Don't miss that.</p><p>Plus, another manager loses his job over the sign steeling scandal. Carlos Beltran is out and hasn't even managed a game. History is made for one team with a female coach.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New developments in regard to the Iranian missile strike on U.S. personnel in Iraq.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details this morning in headlines. Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>After it was released that 11 U.S. soldiers were evacuated and treated for a concussion-like symptoms following the strike in Iraq, despite earlier claims that there were no casualties, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini said in his first weekly sermon since 2012 that it had, quote, divine support in delivering a, quote, slap in the face to the United States. The sermon came amid a rash of violent protests related to the downing of a Ukrainian airplane that killed all 176 people on board.</p><p>Well, Microsoft is taking on climate change. It's looking to trap all of the carbon dioxide it's ever sent into the atmosphere by the year 2050. All part of Microsoft's goal of becoming carbon negative by 2030. Microsoft plans to invest a billion dollars over the next four years to support company's developing technology to remove or reduce carbon dioxide.</p><p>\"The New York Mets\" part ways with new manager Carlos Beltran months before the kickoff to the 2020 season. All of this coming in the wake of the MLB sign stealing scandals. Beltran was named in the report in the Houston Astros, but he was not disciplined by MLB. The Mets hired him just three months ago. He didn't get to manage a single game. The Mets will not pay his $3 million salary.</p><p>And the San Francisco Giants making her-story, get it, after hiring MLB's first female full-time coach. There she is, Alyssa Nakken. She first joined the team as an intern back in 2014. She played softball in college in Sacramento State. No word yet if she will be one of the seven coaches, the team has 13, but only seven are allowed to dress in uniform for the Giants' games, but big achievement for females in MLB. Go Alyssa.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Her-story.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Her-story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like it.</p><p>Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Beltran?</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh, I don't know, I'm not a big baseball guy.</p><p>I think maybe this is -- let to sort of no such thing as bad publicity. Maybe it keeps the off season more interesting and get young people into baseball again. I don't know. I'm not a --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I -- a lot of baseball --</p><p>LONSKI: I --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Steve Forbes, Brian Kilmeade, they think that this is a huge cheating scandal that will damage baseball and put an asterisk next to the Astros World Series championship.</p><p>LONSKI: Then you know all about the 2018 Red Sox, the degree to which they benefited from cheating. You know, Alex Cora was the manager, came from Houston with the same technique, shady techniques that perhaps helped his team.</p><p>And then you ask yourself, the money these guys are getting paid on the Red Sox, I think one guy signed a contract for one year for $27 million. He was the MVP in 2018. Were those numbers inflated by cheating.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, big numbers.</p><p>All right, we'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, not quitting each other. GAP decide to call off its split with Old Navy. More on that and the about face. The stock is, as you can see, up 5.25 percent this morning on that news.</p><p>Then singer selected. Demi Lovato's new Super Bowl gig making buzz this morning.</p><p>We're back right after this break. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Markets are breaking records again. Check out the futures this morning. We're looking at a gain of about 80 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average, pushing further into uncharted territory. All three major indices closing at the highs of the day yesterday with strong gains across the board. Investors riding high off of the strong bank earnings that we saw this week and the phase one China trade deal signing. That ceremony this week.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about markets and investing today is Skybridge Capital co-Chief Investment Officer Troy Gayeski.</p><p>Troy, it's great to see you.</p><p>TROY GAYESKI, CO-CIO, SKYBRIDGE CAPITAL: Yes, great to see you again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So would you put new money to work in stocks now or are you shorting this market?</p><p>GAYESKI: No, I think you want to put new money to work until the Feds stops expanding their balance sheet, which they claim they're going to do until the end of Q2, but they've given themselves plenty of wiggle room to continue to expand that.</p><p>What we know is that that's -- the Fed's the most powerful institution. They've been driving markets since the financial crisis. They took a pause there in '17 and '18 when fiscal policy took over. But the -- the path of least resistance is higher prices for the time being.</p><p>FREEMAN: So is there a multiple that you would say, OK, it's time to stop buying?</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, I think 20x (ph). I mean our thesis coming into the year is - -</p><p>FREEMAN: Twenty times forward earnings --</p><p>GAYESKI: Forward earnings, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: On the S&amp;P?</p><p>GAYESKI: That's correct. Yes. So coming into the year, we were roughly 18, 18.2. And our thesis was that at some point in the first half you had a reasonable probability to hit 20. After that, I think you want to get a little more cautious because remember what the Fed is doing here and, you know, they've done so many policies changes over the last 18 months that you can't discount that.</p><p>But basically what they're doing is they're running -- they're willing to run higher probability of medium-term bubble risk in order to further lower near term recession risk. But it -- but once they stop extending their balance sheet, there -- there will be a correction. It's just a question of how severe.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rather than looking at the multiple, you can just easily look at the ten-year yield and -- because in recent history, particularly in November of 2018, when it got to nearly 3.25 percent, that's when the bottom fell out of the market. So that -- that's a good indicator of Fed policy and also an appetite for risk that once that yield starts going up, it becomes more attractive to investors. But right now it's -- it's stocks. And the dividend yield on the S&amp;P over 1.8 percent on the 10-year.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, and let's not forget, too, there is a non-zero probability of a meaningful blow off top here, right? I mean we haven't seen a bubble in equities yet, but we could very easily get there. And, you know, people could peel off risk at 20x, but we could end up meaningfully higher. And then the unfortunate part of that is, you know, a lot of people forget, but the -- the last two economic downturns were caused by collapsing bubbles, right? You had a collapsing equity bubble coming out of the Internet, you know, era and you had a collapsing housing bubble.</p><p>So it is more concerning, medium to long-term, that that could help lead to an economic downturn again. But for the time being, recession risk has gone down meaningfully, growth overseas has at least stabilized --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GAYESKI: And the Fed's pumping in new liquidity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what you're saying is there's just not a lot of wiggle room at this point in terms of an earnings miss. I mean the good news is, is that the backdrop has been pretty strong.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're in the midst of the fourth quarter earnings season right now. It's been a strong start in terms of the banks, right?</p><p>GAYESKI: Particularly for Morgan Stanley.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see anything on the horizon in terms of guidance, in terms of negative commentary from the corporate side of things that could, you know, mess with that wiggle room?</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, I mean, in terms of the broader market, it's unlikely that we get enough negative surprises to knock this trend off in the short-term. I mean clearly, geopolitically, that's always there, right? So clear -- if we had gone to war with Iran, all bets are off, right? If things heat up with North Korea, all bets are off.</p><p>But it's really difficult, when you look at economic fundamentals or you look at consumption growth, you look at the growth in government spending. You know, decline in CapEx has -- has certainly abated and some argue CapEx might even come back and be a positive contributor.</p><p>You know, Europe stopped falling off a cliff. They've at least stabilized.</p><p>So, you know, if Target has bad earnings, that's not enough. You know, everyone expects, you know, mediocre outcomes for most retail.</p><p>I think if the banks came out earlier this week and showed massive increases in delinquent loans or net interest margin was collapsing more than the markets expected, that might have been a problem. But unlike --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how about if it looks like Joe Biden is going to be the candidate?</p><p>GAYESKI: Well, yes, so now we're getting into the election, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GAYESKI: And from our perspective, (INAUDIBLE). So, as you get into late Q2, Q3, market attention will be much more focused on that outcome. So, you know, I think that consensus from most investors now is that Trump will win easily. We would caution people that it's easy for a Republican to win Pennsylvania. You know how hard that is, Maria, historically. But that does look like the way it's going.</p><p>The secondary assumption, if not Trump then Biden, and people think Biden will be a classic corporatist Democratic president like Clinton and Obama. The danger with that, though, of course, is if you look at Biden's plan, you know, taking the corporate tax rate from 21 to 28 percent, taxing capital gains as the same rate as ordinary, that's obviously not a market- friendly plan. So as we get into Q3, and you talk about what could cause a meaningful downturn or correction, it's clearly an election outcome that's suboptimal for earnings and for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I mean John Lonski, do you see any other market-friendly plans on the Democratic stage?</p><p>LONSKI: None whatsoever. But I would say that -- let's not forget that in the event the economy falters, doesn't do as well as expected, I think interest rates are going to come down quickly. I think the Fed's going to be quick to act because the Fed is indicating repeatedly they're not that worried about inflation. Let it run a little bit over target. They don't care. And they're going to cut rates to keep this recovery going.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, that's what they're -- I mean that's what they've basically done, all right, they've cut three times, they're expanding their balance sheet aggressively.</p><p>LONSKI: And in 2020 we have to see those lower interest rates, lowering borrowing costs from 2019 begin to feed in to spending, provide a boost in spending, a faster rate of growth for home sales. You know, we have the highest weekly reading on mortgage applications for the purchase of a home this latest week for the current recovery.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, I mean, clearly lower interest rates have finally affected housing and housing construction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GAYESKI: I mean earnings --</p><p>LONSKI: All those are next in line.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, of course.</p><p>LONSKI: They need a boost.</p><p>GAYESKI: But, look, the reality is, is consumption growth's been 2.5 plus the last several years and we've created 2.1 million jobs last year, 2.6. No one expected that. Very hard to see growth of consumption less than 2 percent. So there's 140 basis points of GDP. You layer over government spending, which is going to grow somewhere between 50 and 75 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Another stimulant.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, you're already at two, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GAYESKI: So that's why, you know, when you look back at all these people that were calling for like 80 percent probability of a recession risk in 2020, the math never worked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GAYESKI: The peak -- peak recession risk was one in three --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they just kept talking themselves into it, recession, recession -- even as we were getting growth number after growth number.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, the American people are smarter into that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Try to talk them into an impeachment, trying to talk them into a recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bingo.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, and --</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GAYESKI: How often do the average consumer pay attention to headlines around the economy? At least --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they're -- they're blowing off all of the noise in Washington.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They are but -- they are the headline. They are the headline. They know, ask anybody how -- what their job is like. Are they making more money? Are they changing jobs? Do they feel secure?</p><p>LONSKI: Yes, the average consumer is also looking at their 401(k).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.</p><p>LONSKI: Yes. And that's going on.</p><p>GAYESKI: If they have a job, their home price is going up and they're not paying that much for gas, you know, they're going to consume.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and --</p><p>MCDOWELL: There are 100 million people invested in 401(k) plans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A hundred million people. So, you know, when the Democrats want to dismiss what's going on in the market, it's just for the rich, that is just simply not true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And on November 9th, on November, 2016, the Dow was at 18,000.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look at where we are right now.</p><p>Troy Gayeski.</p><p>GAYESKI: It's amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you.</p><p>GAYESKI: Yes, great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Troy Gayeski joining us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A quick break, and then Nancy Pelosi versus FaceBook. The House speaker slamming the social media giant for what she says is misleading the American people. We will get into it.</p><p>And then the age of misery, when unhappiness hits an all-time high. We will tell you when to expect it.</p><p>Plus, a real purple haze. An Arizona pot farm turns the sky purple. We will explain how.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. TGIF. It is Friday, January 17th.</p><p>Take a look at markets this morning, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We are looking at unchartered territories yet again. Futures pointing to another record high on Wall Street right out of the gates on the Dow Jones Industrial average, up 77 points right now. The Nasdaq futures up 33 and the S&amp;P futures currently up 7.75.</p><p>This after the major indices closed at all-time high of the sessions yesterday. Buying driven by strong earnings and the Senate passing USMCA yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European gains across the board. As you'll see, the FT 100's up half a percent, 36 points. The CAC quarante in Paris up 50 points, almost 1 percent, and the DAX index in Germany higher by 95, three quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, modest gains coming after China's economy grew at the slowest pace last year in nearly 30 years, 6 percent, 6.1 percent. There were some upbeat numbers, data on Chinese industrial production, but, as you can see, the Shanghai composite was flat overnight.</p><p>Then this, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unloading on FaceBook yesterday.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti now on headlines.</p><p>Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Was it deserved, Maria? Nancy Pelosi accusing FaceBook of using its technologies to mislead users, saying its business model is aimed at making money.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): And I think that they have been very abusive of the great opportunity that technology has given them. But my thought about them is, they don't want -- all they want are their tax cuts and no anti- trust action against them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Meanwhile, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that FaceBook is dropping a plan to sell ads in WhatsApp. The move marking a reversal from the controversial idea that forced the creators of WhatsApp to resign.</p><p>GAP is scrapping plans to spin off Old Navy into its own company. GAP says the cost of breaking up and softer performance led to that decision. The announcement coming at a tough time in retail. Macy's is closing stores. JC Penney and Kohl's also out with disappointing sales.</p><p>It's not purple rain, but it is certainly a beautiful purple haze. This is light coming from a medical marijuana farm falling over the sky in Snowflake, Arizona. You can see the odd purple glow. Some people thought this was pretty. Other complained about the light pollution from Copper State Farms, which is the largest medical marijuana wholesaler in the state. But I think the answer is, Maria, red lights and blue lights are needed to make the plants grow. Red and blue together make purple.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ah, so that's what it is, you have those lights, red and blue lights. Got it.</p><p>Lauren, thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile this, USMCA crossing the finish line, headed to the president's desk. The NAFTA replacement passed the Senate yesterday 89-10, sending the deal to the president's desk. There was excitement on both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi thinking this could led to infrastructure reform.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): When we come back that first week, we will be rolling out our infrastructure legislation.</p><p>We do believe that now with the passage the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement that they might be interested in cooperating in other ways.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is \"The Wall Street Journal's\" senior writer Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>Jon, good to see you.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh we've been talking about infrastructure for a long time.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that gets done?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Not this year. Not this year. I mean the -- the -- we're heading towards election season and we're also in the middle of an impeachment, so it doesn't seem like it.</p><p>But I think -- I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's trying to make it look like business as usual. Yes, we're impeaching the president. No big deal. Business as usual (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Or also that she's leading -- or that she's leading the charge, that somehow --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like she should get credit for USMCA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, that it was somehow her idea to renegotiate --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Canada-Mexico trade deal, which was a campaign promise by President Trump when he was running for the office. I love the cooperating -- cooperating with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: No, I think the good news here is that things are lining up pretty well for the president in 2020. You know, he just got this deal done with China. He got USMCA passed. So much uncertainty held back the economy last year, and particular on the investment front. That uncertainty disappears. And I think we're -- we're setting up for another pretty decent year on -- for economic growth.</p><p>LONSKI: And I would say on infrastructure, less of a need for increased government spending when the unemployment rate is at 3.5 percent and you have small businesses indicating that their biggest problem is a lack of quality labor.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, but, I mean, I think the economy could use -- the United States could use more spending on roads, bridges, 5G technology in rural areas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not worried about the $22 trillion in debt?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're not worried about a $2 trillion price tag?</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's a -- that's a big problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gulp.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That's certainly a big problem. Yes.</p><p>I wanted to ask you a question, Maria. You were just in San Francisco.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Did you get a chance to walk around, see the streets at all?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I did.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Is the homeless problem like -- as big as --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I did. We did a shoot with the police and we went to a lot of the areas in downtown San Francisco. And then we went to residential areas. And it's unbelievable.</p><p>We are going to be doing a special on it. There are tents that are lining the streets so you cannot walk on the sidewalk, Jon. It's unbelievable. And you drive on the street, the whole street smells like marijuana. I -- it's -- it's just a sad and -- and just terrible thing to see. San Francisco.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I -- can I point out something too.</p><p>By the way, you -- if you were on social media, Jon Hilsenrath, you would know that because Maria already has posted some photos from that tour --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That she did of San Francisco.</p><p>But we need to start pushing back on the fallacy that it's a housing shortage that's causing the homeless problem. A great deal of homelessness is caused because people are mentally ill. And we've spent literally the last 60 years in this country pushing against institutionalization, moving away from that, and these individuals who were clearly struggling --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With mental illness are on the streets and they're not being cared for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And money is not the solution. You've seen it here in New York. Almost a billion dollars has been spent --</p><p>FREEMAN: Well -- well but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's also addiction. A lot of these people are addicted also.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, but -- I think there's -- there's -- I mean regulation is an issue here because they just -- they don't build -- they don't build new housing there. They don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It goes back to policy.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And they won't -- and they don't build up. You know, these are places that need more space. There's, you know, technology talent flocking to all of these cities in California and they're driving --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Especially when you want to be a sanctuary city.</p><p>HILSENRATH: They've driving -- they're driving everybody else out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's also a sanctuary city. They've got open doors. And then they've got a lot of free stuff, free -- these policies, you know, enabling people to just not work and stay on the streets and be addicted. It all goes back to policies. The police were saying to me, look, we want this changed. We need a different policy to help these people actually give them opportunities to work.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's releasing people from prison and people who are mentally ill.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: It's a lot --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And there's been research done about this. There's --</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's -- it is a big movement in this country. And you've seen what I was going to say is, here in New York City, that you've had about a billion dollars spent on the Thrive Initiative, which is being run by the mayor's wife --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's been completely wasted. And the problem with the mentally ill and people who are mentally unstable has actually gotten worse.</p><p>So, again, governments the problem and government is the -- provides no solution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the government is the problem. It's definitely the policy.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think there's a lot of policy issues. Where you have cities with similar climate, Texas, Florida, they don't have the same homeless problem. They (INAUDIBLE) sheltered homeless problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They don't -- they have different policies.</p><p>FREEMAN: So there's a policy issue in California and San Francisco in particular.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, definitely. Absolutely. I agree.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I didn't mean to change the subject.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, no, I'm glad -- I'm glad you asked me, because it was something that we were very interested in and we did take a little while to go and walk around with the police to see where the worst of it is. And it was -- and, by the way, it was just like a mile away from where there are tents all over the streets, up and down, a mile away, Pacific Heights is a beautiful neighborhood.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean it's like you can't walk a mile without seeing it.</p><p>HILSENRATH: This is what I find so fascinating.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then you have all the white collar people in the Weston Hotel, at JP Morgan, the bankers come out of the hotel, tents down -- up and down the street.</p><p>Go ahead, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: These are the most industrious, economically strong places in the country.</p><p>California has had a very fast expansion. Silicon Valley is driving the world economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is not new. This is a policy that's been in place in San Francisco --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Since I was born. Since the summer of love and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's getting worse, though, Dagen. It's getting -- it's -- what new is it's getting -- it's gotten worse.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I lived in San Francisco in -- during the dot com bubble and bust and it was exactly like that then and they did nothing about it and it's only gotten worse.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where they tolerate people basically shiving (ph) your tires every night because you're not parked correctly and they don't do anything about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're not drug dealers, you know, they're selling drugs and there's no accountability. You know, that -- that was one of the issues that the police kept saying to me, that there's no accountability. You could see people, you know, addicted, selling drugs, these petty crimes. They're not going to jail. They're on the streets. So it's just continuing the issue.</p><p>I wanted to ask you about China --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But -- but we're close to out of time. But do you think that's going to -- is that going to get imported to the United States? Does that impact the rest of the world because China's seeing this --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, I think -- I think the release of uncertainty is really helpful. You know, when it comes to China buying $200 billion worth of American stuff --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: My point is, I believe it when I see it. You know, look at what's going on in commodity markets right now. Commodity prices aren't moving. Stocks are up but soybean prices haven't got anywhere. That's the dog that isn't barking. That's telling you that people are very skeptical of the Chinese -- that China's going to follow through on these promises.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally agree with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And, look, their economy is slowing down. How are they going to ramp up $200 billion worth of purchases when growth is slowing down?</p><p>BARTIROMO: My worry was, when they took that deal that was agreed upon, according to Secretary Mnuchin, at the end of the year, 200 billion, 40 to 50 in ag buys, enforcement mechanism, they should have released the English version of that immediately so that everybody -- we could know what the promises were, instead of giving it to the Chinese and perhaps in translation changing it because there were certain words like, for example, maybe they'll buy as per market demand, in other words, they'll buy what they want when they want.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right, and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's not -- or they won't necessarily stick to 40 to 50 billion. I'm -- great. I agree with you, I'm skeptical that they're going to keep their promises.</p><p>LONSKI: I just want to put this in context. They say that the Chinese are going to buy an additional $200 billion of U.S. exports. That's $200 billion extra, compared to what is less than $185 billion of goods and services, exports for the U.S. being purchased today. That's crazy. More than doubling the current amount over two years. Wow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I -- it is a wow.</p><p>Jon, thank you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Jon Hilsenrath, \"Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>Quick break, and then former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon is here talking all things impeachment 2020. Then a Justice Department investigation into leaks. Don't miss that. We've got a big interview coming up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Two veterans investing in business and women's education, where they once battled terrorists. Footwear company Combat Flip Flops, expanding into jewelry and other apparel, and with a percentage of sales providing funds to educate girls in Afghanistan. It doesn't get much better than this.</p><p>Joining us right now, former Army Ranges and co-founders of Combat Flip Flops, Matthew Griffin and Donald Lee.</p><p>Great to see you guys. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW GRIFFIN, CO-FOUNDER, COMBAT FLIP FLOPS: Good morning.</p><p>DONALD LEE, CO-FOUNDER, COMBAT FLIP FLOPS: Thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What a phenomenal idea.</p><p>Tell us how you started the business, why you started this, how the transition from military life has been, Matthew?</p><p>GRIFFIN: We started this business a few years after getting out of the military. Starting going back to Afghanistan and I saw where businesses were providing more security and stability and improvement than conflict was. And so we walked into a combat boot factory in Kabul, Afghanistan, and had the idea for Combat Flip Flops.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How's it going?</p><p>LEE: It's going. It's going. As you can imagine, you know, manufacturing in close conflict areas is difficult but we're getting through it.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where are you -- where do you manufacture right now, guys?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Right now we manufacture in Afghanistan, Colombia, Laos and right here in America at home.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where here in the United States?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Now, we printed a variety of different t-shirt and hat locations all across the nation and then we deliver to our customers as fast as we can.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I just tweeted this out, I'm about to send the tweet actually so that our -- my followers understand, this was aluminum, this is a bracelet, but this was what? This was part of land mine?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes, so that's our Be a Better Human bangle. And we have our Be a Better Human coin wrap. But, yes, they were landmines dropped during the Vietnam War and they were detonated and cleared and then local artists turned it into jewelry. And then each piece sold clears three square meters of landmines.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, my God, that's incredible. Where are these -- these scarves made?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Those are made in a woman-owned factory in Kabul, Afghanistan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is rad.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That is incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, this is exciting because my wife has never liked me wearing flip flops, but with these I could say, you are literally helping the children of Afghanistan.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: (INAUDIBLE) wear those.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes, for each piece -- for each piece of footwear sold, we put a girl in school in Afghanistan for a day. And we like that because educated women raise educated families and educated families are resistant to radicalism.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it.</p><p>So how -- what are these made of? I mean tell us about the products.</p><p>LEE: Those are --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You go.</p><p>LEE: So those are the -- the flip flops you're holding are our flagship model, the AK-47s leather upper combat boot rubber foot -- sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: AK-47.</p><p>LEE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: From an AK-47 here.</p><p>LEE: The shell casing on the strap.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, my God.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes. So each one of our products tell a story. That's the AK-47. These are the Flop Raiders (ph). These are the Mark 19's. So they have military names, but they're the new weapon for change.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How many people are you employing now?</p><p>GRIFFIN: It really depends on the time of year, but anywhere between 50 to 200.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And most -- and veterans? What percentage are veterans?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes, 40 percent of our company is veterans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's amazing.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazing. What a great idea.</p><p>Guys, thank you.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And thank you for your service to our great country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Come back.</p><p>LEE: We will.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Don't be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Keep going.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm telling a former Army ranger this, don't be nervous on TV. It's OK&gt;</p><p>Live TV's a lot harder than it looks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Matthew --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this scarf is only less than $20.</p><p>GRIFFIN: $20.</p><p>LEE: $20.</p><p>MCDOWELL: $19.99.</p><p>FREEMAN: For a scarf, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, right, what's the price of these?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Those are $59.99 and the Flop Raiders are $39.99. And then our Mark 19s are $64.99.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you feel good wearing them. That's for sure.</p><p>FREEMAN: Deal (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: Matthew Griffin, Donald Lee, thank you so much.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Check out the company.</p><p>Coming up, the age of misery. The point when unhappiness hits an all-time high making a buzz this morning.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Time for the morning buzz.</p><p>First up, Demi Lovato set to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl, a week after taking the stage at the Grammys. The two appearances marking her first performances since rehab.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love this. I wish her luck. We all do. It is a very important moment. My favorite anthem was Lady Gaga at Super Bowl 50. Yes, better than Whitney Houston because Whitney Houston rang to a recorded track. She was lip-syncing. Lady Gaga killed it and we wish Demi Lovato the best.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: But Lauren Daigle at the college football national championship.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>FREEMAN: Very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, middle-age misery. Forty-seven apparently the magic number when it comes to being unhappy. A new study says that that's the peak moment for sadness. A Dartmouth professor pointing to a 50, a so- called -- I'm sorry, to a so-called happiness curve with the absolute lowest point just over 48 years old.</p><p>LONSKI: This has what -- this is what has become of economic research at Dartmouth of all places? Haven't you ever heard of the midlife crisis?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And how about, you know, 60 is the new 30.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>LONSKI: It just goes on and on.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right. What would we do without experts?</p><p>LONSKI: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: But I think this is kind of insulting now that I've got that in the rear view, it's all happiness from here until, well, you know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what the brilliance of being over 50 -- I just turned 51 -- is you stop giving a damn about everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's like, oh, I got a little pooch in the gut, don't care. I'm eating a piece of chocolate cake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well --</p><p>LONSKI: I think you're lying about your age.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because -- no, I'm 51.</p><p>LONSKI: You're (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I'm 51. All day, 51.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So it is easy being green, especially if you're this adorable puppy. A North Carolina family celebrating a new litter when lo and behold the fourth puppy arrives with a splash of color. The vet was not concerned and says the color will fade. The puppy's name, Hulk, of course.</p><p>Have you ever seen -- look at the color.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>James.</p><p>MCDOWELL: James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, it does make it easy. If you've got a big litter, you know which one is yours. So that's -- that's always helpful. And who wouldn't want that little guy.

The CSI 300 Index of big caps gained 1.3 per cent, or 42.07 points, to 3,363.90, while the ChiNext gauge of smaller companies edged up 0.8 per cent, or 11.81 points, to 1,455.50. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before the market open, the yuan edged up against the US dollar after the People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.8183 per dollar, 0.24 per cent higher than the previous fix. That triggered a round of bargain hunting in stocks after recent falls, said Francis Lun, chief executive officer of Geo Securities. </p><p>He also noted that the improved mood had offset concerns over draft rules by the China Securities Regulatory Commission released on Friday for a trading link between the Shanghai and London stock exchanges. The plan has raised the question of whether money would flow out of Chinese stocks. </p><p>\"There is a Chinese saying: the thunder is big but the rain is very small - a lot of sound but little substance. It is like the Hong Kong-China connect - not as big as was expected,\" he said. </p><p>Meanwhile, concerns over turbulence in emerging markets would be restricted to Argentina and Turkey with East Asia seeing minimal impact, he said. </p><p>In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index gained 0.94 per cent, or 260.80 points, to 27,973.34, but was unable to recover the 28,000 level amid lingering concerns over the ongoing US-China trade war and its impact on the city. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.71 per cent, or 77.06 points, to 10,890.63. </p><p>Among movers, Tencent rebounded with a 1.74 per cent rise to HK$338.60, in its first gain in five days. The technology giant is one of the key investors in Meituan Dianping, China's largest online services platform, which is planning a US$4.4 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong. It would be the city's second big tech float this year, after mobile phone maker Xiaomi. </p><p>CK Asset, one of the flagship companies of the Cheung Kong conglomerate, rose 4.78 per cent to HK$58.15 after it said it had bought back 1.8 million shares for HK$100.2 million (US$12.8 million). Its sister company, CK Hutchison Holdings, gained 3.1 per cent to HK$91.25. </p><p>Telecoms gained traction late in the day after Bloomberg reported that the Chinese government may engineer a merger between carriers to boost its push into advanced 5G mobile networks. China Unicom climbed 5.86 per cent to HK$9.58, having reached a 30-day high of HK$9.77 earlier in the session and leading gains on the Hang Seng Index. China Telecom rose 4.01 per cent to HK$3.89. </p><p>Mainland Chinese banks were heavily traded throughout the day, seeing slight gains by the close. China Construction Bank ended up 0.58 per cent at HK$6.97, Bank of China rose 0.28 per cent to HK$3.53 and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ended up 0.35 per cent to HK$5.79. </p><p>Insurer Ping An, which saw the second highest turnover, rose 1.25 per cent to HK$76.80. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2018.

Well, it\u2019s been another week in the grip of the rapidly-globalising COVID-19. I\u2019m now spending a good chunk of time explaining to friends and family in Europe how they can expect their daily lives to change as the virus spreads. Is the effective shutdown of the global economy now possible? I don\u2019t get the sense that Europe or the US are well prepared. Our main scoop this week shows how China is carving out special treatment to allow a few high-tech champions to keep manufacturing. Also check out the CSIS\u2019s\u00a0comprehensive report (When sages speak) on China\u2019s tech advance and Delivery Hero\u2019s appetite for an Asian saga (In the spotlight). Finally, don\u2019t forget Tech Scroll Asia is free for one month \u2014 get your friends or colleagues to sign up\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://ft.com/asia-tech\"> here</url>.</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story \u2014 Exclusive</p><p>Dispatches from China\u2019s virus-hit supply chain present a mixed picture. This\u00a0 on-the-spot report \u00a0from the FT\u2019s Sun Yu in Henan province depicts deep disruption. But semiconductor and display makers in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, are being given special permission to maintain operations, according to this exclusive in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/China-quietly-keeps-Wuhan-tech-projects-running-despite-lockdown\">Nikkei Asian Review.</url></p><p>The special treatment for Yangtze Memory Technologies \u2014 a memory chipmaker that aims to be a rival to Samsung, SK Hynix and others \u2014 underlines its strategic importance to Beijing. It is allowed to continue shipping products out of Wuhan and has received components in through the city\u2019s cordon sanitaire since early February, sources said.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis>\u00a0Such special treatment is repeated for display industry leaders BOE Technology Group and China Star Optoelectronics Technology, which also have facilities in Wuhan. These companies make screens for smartphones, computers, televisions, tablets and other appliances.\u00a0</p><p>BOE has also issued \u201cvirus bonds\u201d, taking advantage of the newly-sanctioned financial instruments to maintain cash flows throughout its network of affiliates to keep operations going.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis>\u00a0The willingness of Chinese authorities to make rare special concessions to important tech companies shows the high esteem in which such corporations are held. But the general disruption across China\u2019s supply chain appears set to persist, particularly for small and medium enterprises with lower priority access to resources and official favour.</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter Mercedes Ruehl.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The head of TikTok\u2019s\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India</emphasis>\u00a0business laid out a bullish vision in an interview with our New Delhi reporter Stephanie Findlay, predicting\u00a0 50 per cent growth \u00a0in users in 2020 after being temporarily banned last year.

Banks including HSBC, Natwest  and Lloyds  were among the risers, on relief that the Bank of England may not impose negative interest rates, along with property firm Land Securities.</p><p> Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets, reckons investors appear to be warming towards equities and other risk assets again. </p><p>After all, ' nothing has fundamentally changed so why not buy everything at slightly discounted prices again after the recent sell-off, ' is a question the bulls will be asking themselves. Central bankers have made it crystal clear that interest rates will remain very low for a long time to come and will be there to provide further support should it be required.</p><p>The relatively low COVID-linked deaths mean investors are not showing too much concern towards rising virus cases. Instead, they remain optimistic over the potential approval of a vaccine soon, which together with ongoing central bank support will probably help accelerate the recovery.</p><p>What's more, we have had data showing profits at industrial companies in China grew for a fourth consecutive month in August, underscoring economic recovery signs. Sentiment has also been supported, among other things, by hopes that the UK and EU officials will make progress as a key week of Brexit talks begins.

Businesses are facing difficulties, people are losing their jobs, and prospects about the future remain uncertain.</p><p>While euro area economic activity rebounded in the third quarter, the recovery remains incomplete, uncertain and uneven. Consumer spending has resumed significantly, but consumers remain cautious owing to anxiety about their job and income prospects.</p><p>Similarly, business investment has been picking up, but weaker demand and elevated uncertainty continue to weigh on firms' investment plans.</p><p>In this context, job retention schemes and national guarantees on bank loans remain critically important factors in reducing uncertainty and softening the impact of the pandemic.</p><p>The public health crisis will \"continue to weigh on economic activity and poses downside risks to the economic outlook\", Lagarde adds. </p><p>enltrIntroductory statement by President Christine @Lagarde at a hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/QGXvsuIaMa\">https://t.co/QGXvsuIaMa</url></p><p> - European Central Bank (@ecb) September 28, 2020</p><p>block-time published-time 2.39pm BST </p><p>Shares in Uber have jumped 3% in early trading, to $35.54, after it persuaded a London court to grant it a new licence to operate in the capital.</p><p>block-time published-time 2.36pm BST </p><p> Wall Street jumps   </p><p> The New York stock exchange has opened sharply higher, as investors try to put recent losses behind them. </p><p>The D ow Jones industrial average has jumped by 376 points, or 1.4%, to 27,550. </p><p>The broader S&amp;P 500 is up 48 points or 1.5% at 3,346, while the tech-focused Nasdaq  is up 159 points or 1.4% at 11,072.</p><p>This follows some choppy weeks - with the Dow falling over 4% during the last four weeks.</p><p>The jump in Chinese industrial profits overnight may have lifted the mood on Wall Street. There's also renewed hope that Congress might agree a new package to protect the US economy from the pandemic.</p><p> Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM  explains: </p><p>The recovery in stocks likely comes down to hopes that a US stimulus deal isn't entirely dead after all. The market selloff has evidently put enough pressure on politicians to water down their demands, with the Democrats unveiling a new proposal of $2.4 trillion and keeping the door open for an even smaller package of $2.2 trillion. </p><p>block-time published-time 2.30pm BST </p><p>While jobs are being created at Aldi, they're unfortunately also being lost at Pizza Hut. </p><p>The owner of Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK will go ahead with plans to shut 29 sites, putting 450 jobs at risk, after creditors voted through an agreement to try to save the pandemic-hit business. </p><p>Pizza Hut Restaurants, the brand's biggest franchise arm in the UK, has agreed a reduction in rent and bills with its landlords and other creditors through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). </p><p>The CVA will not affect Pizza Hut's delivery operations, which are operated separately. The UK restaurants are run under a franchise arrangement with Yum! Brands, the S&amp;P 500 company that is also the owner of the KFC and the Mexican-themed Taco Bell chains. </p><p>The closures will be spread across much of the UK, with branches in London, Glasgow and Cardiff among those affected.

Profits at Chinese industrial companies jumped by 19% in August, the fourth straight month of gains. The figures suggest that China's economy is continuing to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, with demand picking up at home and abroad. The news sparked a rally in Asia, and helped European stocks to rally by over 2% today - in their best session since June (a day after the worst session since June!). Wall Street is also higher, with the Dow currently up 492 points or 1.8% at 27,666. A deputy governor at the Bank of England has indicated that he doesn't believe interest rates should be cut below zero. Sir Dave Ramsden's comments helped to send the pound sharply higher today, with sterling up 1% against the US dollar, and 0.7% higher against the euro. The pound also benefitted from hopes of a Brexit deal, with crunch talks between the UK and EU resuming this week. In other news... ECB president Christine Lagarde has warned that the eurozone recovery is fragile, so politicians need to provide job retention schemes and loan guarantees Uber has been granted a further 18-month licence in London after an appeal found it was a \"fit and proper\" company to run private hire car services. The owner of Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK is pressing on with plans to shut 29 sites, putting 450 jobs at risk Caesars, the US gambling firm, says it is in \"advanced discussions\" concerning a possible cash offer for William Hill Budget supermarket chain Aldi is creating 4,000 UK jobs..... as the race to takeover rival ASDA speeds up Goodnight. GW Boom! European stock markets have posted very strong gains, as a burst of optimism sends share up across the globe. The Stoxx 600 index of European listed companies has closed 2.3% higher tonight, as it made a strong recovery from last week's losses. Germany's DAX led the rally, surging 3.2%, with France's CAC gaining over 2.3%. Every sector gained ground, led by banks and consumer cyclical firms. Hearing aid manufacturer Sonovo surged 13%, and steelmaker ArcelorMittal gained 11%. In London, the FTSE 100 index ended the day 85 points higher at 5927, a one-week closing high. Banks including HSBC, Natwest and Lloyds were among the risers, on relief that the Bank of England may not impose negative interest rates, along with property firm Land Securities. Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets, reckons investors appear to be warming towards equities and other risk assets again. After all, 'nothing has fundamentally changed so why not buy everything at slightly discounted prices again after the recent sell-off,' is a question the bulls will be asking themselves. Central bankers have made it crystal clear that interest rates will remain very low for a long time to come and will be there to provide further support should it be required. The relatively low COVID-linked deaths mean investors are not showing too much concern towards rising virus cases. Instead, they remain optimistic over the potential approval of a vaccine soon, which together with ongoing central bank support will probably help accelerate the recovery. What's more, we have had data showing profits at industrial companies in China grew for a fourth consecutive month in August, underscoring economic recovery signs. Sentiment has also been supported, among other things, by hopes that the UK and EU officials will make progress as a key week of Brexit talks begins. This may help explain why the pound was clearly the biggest riser among the major currencies this morning. More takeover news: The billionaire owners of the British petrol forecourts operator EG Group have taken pole position in the \u00a36.5bn race for control of Asda after being named the preferred bidder by the supermarket's US owner. Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who are working with the private-equity firm TDR Capital, have pushed out a rival offer from the private-equity firm Apollo Global Management (who are also in the race to buy William Hill...) More here: Britain's stock market is pushing higher, with bank shares getting a lift from today's burst of optimism. HSBC is still sharply higher, up 8%, after China's Ping An expanded its stake in the lender. Other financial stocks are rallying too, with Natwest up 7.5%, Lloyds gaining 7% and Barclays up 6.9%. Sir Dave Ramsden's suggestion that the Bank of England won't cut interest rates below zero is bolstering the banking sector - as negative rates are extremely bad for profitability. So with an hour to go, the FTSE 100 is now up 106 points or 1.8% at 5949. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has warned that the eurozone economy is weak - and needs fiscal support. Testifying to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Lagarde warns that the recovery is highly dependent on the Covid-19 pandemic - so government packages to protect loans and jobs are vital. Lagarde explains: The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still being felt across the euro area. Businesses are facing difficulties, people are losing their jobs, and prospects about the future remain uncertain. While euro area economic activity rebounded in the third quarter, the recovery remains incomplete, uncertain and uneven. Consumer spending has resumed significantly, but consumers remain cautious owing to anxiety about their job and income prospects. Similarly, business investment has been picking up, but weaker demand and elevated uncertainty continue to weigh on firms' investment plans. In this context, job retention schemes and national guarantees on bank loans remain critically important factors in reducing uncertainty and softening the impact of the pandemic. The public health crisis will \"continue to weigh on economic activity and poses downside risks to the economic outlook\", Lagarde adds. Shares in Uber have jumped 3% in early trading, to $35.54, after it persuaded a London court to grant it a new licence to operate in the capital. The New York stock exchange has opened sharply higher, as investors try to put recent losses behind them. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 376 points, or 1.4%, to 27,550. The broader S&amp;P 500 is up 48 points or 1.5% at 3,346, while the tech-focused Nasdaq is up 159 points or 1.4% at 11,072. This follows some choppy weeks - with the Dow falling over 4% during the last four weeks. The jump in Chinese industrial profits overnight may have lifted the mood on Wall Street. There's also renewed hope that Congress might agree a new package to protect the US economy from the pandemic. Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM explains: The recovery in stocks likely comes down to hopes that a US stimulus deal isn't entirely dead after all. The market selloff has evidently put enough pressure on politicians to water down their demands, with the Democrats unveiling a new proposal of $2.4 trillion and keeping the door open for an even smaller package of $2.2 trillion. While jobs are being created at Aldi, they're unfortunately also being lost at Pizza Hut. The owner of Pizza Hut restaurants in the UK will go ahead with plans to shut 29 sites, putting 450 jobs at risk, after creditors voted through an agreement to try to save the pandemic-hit business. Pizza Hut Restaurants, the brand's biggest franchise arm in the UK, has agreed a reduction in rent and bills with its landlords and other creditors through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The CVA will not affect Pizza Hut's delivery operations, which are operated separately. The UK restaurants are run under a franchise arrangement with Yum! Brands, the S&amp;P 500 company that is also the owner of the KFC and the Mexican-themed Taco Bell chains. The closures will be spread across much of the UK, with branches in London, Glasgow and Cardiff among those affected. However, the deal will save the jobs of more than 5,000 workers, a spokeswoman said. Over in parliament, Boris Johnson's spokesman has told reporters there is still \"much to be done\" before a trade deal can be agreed with Europe. But while there are still significant gaps, a deal is \"still possible\", he adds (via Reuters). The pound has slipped back slightly, but is still solidly higher against the US dollar (at $1.286) and the euro ((EURO)1.102). Brexit deal optimism has lifted the pound to a three-week high against the euro, up one euro cent at (EURO)1.105. Some traders are hopeful that the crunch talks between UK and EU negotiators this week could lead to a breakthrough. John Hardy of Saxo Bank says there is a \"more positive tone\" surrounding the negotiations, but points out there are still serious hurdles to overcome: The Brexit talks are set to get more formal this week and starting tomorrow, with this round seen as a last dash effort if any agreement is to be made on Boris Johnson's timeline aiming for mid-October agreement. Particular focus from the EU side will apparently be on how any trade deal will be enforced after the recently passed Brexit bill could walk back key portions of the Withdrawal Agreement, which effectively stipulated a customs border across the Irish Sea (separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.) Brad Bechtel of Jefferies is somewhat sceptical, though, telling clients: There were some positive articles in the press about the prospects for Brexit. The 9th week of negotiation begins today and there were articles indicating that both sides seem to be getting closer which will allow them to enter the 'tunnel' or final stage of talks for an agreement. I'll believe it when I see it but for now its helping the GBP. Wall Street is on track to open strongly in two hours time, following the positive moves in Asia-Pacific markets, and in Europe. Big tech shares are primed to jump - with Apple up 2.4% in pre-market trading and Amazon rising 1.8%. The jump in Chinese factory profits over the weekend is lifting spirits in the markets, and helping investors focus on the recovery from the Covid-19 slump. Tech shares are due a good day. Between then, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have lost roughly $817nn during September, according to Marketwatch, which puts the group on pace for the steepest monthly slump on record. BoE deputy governor Dave Ramsden also warned that Covid-19, Brexit and the presidential US election are all risks to the UK recovery. Ramsden says the slump in UK growth during the lockdown was not as sharp as the Bank had feared, but it still expects unemployment to jump sharply in the next few months. He also warned of the danger of labour market 'scarring' - meaning some people will struggle to find work even once the crisis is over. Back in the markets, the pound is surging even higher. Sterling is now up 1.7 cents against the US dollar today to $1.29, a new one-week high. Brexit optimism is one factor. Another is that deputy Bank of England governor Dave Ramsden has dampened suggestions the UK could impose negative interest rates. Ramsden told the Society of Professional Economists that he didn't believe interest rates could be cut below their current record low, saying: \"For me, I see the effective lower bound still at 0.1 which is where Bank Rate is at present. Ramsden added, though, that the BoE had a duty to examine whether negative rates could play a role in the recovery. This is a hot issue at the Bank. Over the weekend, BoE rate setter Silvana Tenreyro said there are \"encouraging signs\" that negative interest rates could boost the struggling economy. She told the Sunday Telegraph: \"We have been discussing our toolkit in recent months, including how effective negative rates might be in the current context. The evidence has been encouraging.\" Uber's general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, has welcomed the court ruling, saying: \"This decision is a recognition of Uber's commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL (Transport for London).\" Here's my colleague Gwyn Topham on Uber's London licence ruling: Uber has been granted the right to a fresh licence in London after an appeal found it was a \"fit and proper\" firm to run private hire car services. Westminster magistrates court ruled in favour of Uber almost a year after Transport for London refused the ride-hailing firm a licence extension over safety concerns. The deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said he had \"sufficient confidence that Uber London Ltd no longer poses a risk to public safety ... despite historical failings,\" after hearing three days of arguments this month. He said Uber had tightened up review processes to tackle document and insurance fraud and it now \"seems to be at the forefront of tackling an industry-wide challenge\". You can read the Uber ruling online, here. In it, senior district judge Tanweer Ikram says Uber has taken steps to improve its operations in London and reduce regulatory breaches, so deserves to have its London licence handed back. He says: ULL [Uber London Limited] does not have a perfect record but it has been an improving picture. The test as to whether ULL are a 'fit and proper person' does not require perfection. I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more. But he concludes by suggesting that Uber could face certain (undefined) conditions..... Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London PHV operator's licence. I do, however, wish to hear from the advocates on conditions and on my determination as to the length of a licence. Shares in Uber have jumped over 6% in pre-market Wall Street trading, after it won its London licence back: In his ruling, Tan Ikram, deputy senior district judge at the Westminster Magistrates Court, said that \"despite their historical failings\" Uber was now a \"fit and proper\" organisation to hold an operator's licence. Taxi app operator Uber is celebrating this morning, after winning back its licence to operate in London. A judge at Westminster Magistrates court has just decided that Uber should be allowed to keep operate, despite its historic failings including allowing drivers with fake IDs to conduct thousands of journeys. Reuters has the details: Uber has won a legal bid to restore its London operating licence, a judge decided on Monday after the city's transport regulator stripped it from the taxi app over safety concerns. Transport for London refused to grant the Silicon Valley-based company a new licence in 2019 due to what it called a \"pattern of failures\" and Uber argued it has since assuaged concerns over insurance verification and driver identification. Uber has still been running in London on a provisional licence. The pound is adding to its earlier gains, amid hopes that the UK and EU can agree a free trade deal in the coming weeks. Sterling it now up nearly a cent against the US dollar at $1.283, its highest level in almost a week. But Neil Wilson of Markets.com warns there could be more bumps before a deal is reached. Brexit talks resume this week and despite all the noise, both sides want a deal. Whilst the UK threw a spanner in the works with the internal market bill, the real substance of the trade deal is what matters. On that front the EU and UK are about 90% there. The problem is the remaining elements and without these sorted there is no deal. Nevertheless there is hope that they will enter the 'tunnel': the period of closed, detailed talks that would lead to a deal. If there is white smoke this week then sterling will rally strongly, but I would expect this to drag on for a while longer, for deadlines to be missed and for GBP crosses to remain exposed to negative headline risk. The race to take over UK betting group William Hill has moved forwards this morning. Caesars, the US gambling firm, says it is in \"advanced discussions\" concerning a possible cash offer for William Hill, which runs high street bookmakers shops and online betting services. Tom Reeg, CEO of Caesars, told the City: \"The opportunity to combine our land based-casinos, sports betting and online gaming in the US is a truly exciting prospect. William Hill's sports betting expertise will complement Caesars' current offering, enabling the combined group to better serve our customers in the fast growing US sports betting and online market. This follows the news on Friday that Caesars and private equity firm, Apollo Management International were both considering a bid. That sent William Hill's shares soaring 40% on Friday, hitting 312p for the first time in over two years. Caesars and William Hill are already partners on sports betting in the US, and there's been rising speculation that they could combine their operations in some way. However... traders may have got over-excited last week. Caesars says today it is considering offering 272p per share. William Hill's shares have now fallen back to that level, a drop of 12% today. Budget supermarket chain Aldi is bucking the trend of rising job losses in the UK, by unveiling plans to create thousands more positions across the country. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: Aldi is to create another 4,000 jobs and open 100 new stores as part of a \u00a31.3bn investment drive in the UK. The new jobs are on top of 3,000 permanent roles the discount supermarket chain has created this year after grocery sales surged during the coronavirus pandemic, while many other businesses have laid off staff. The German retailer is targeting 1,200 stores in the UK by 2025. Aldi is Britain's fifth-largest grocer with 894 stores and more than 36,000 staff. It is also upgrading more than 100 existing shops, as well as expanding its warehouses. The jump in Chinese factory profits has helped all the major European markets bounce back this morning. The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 index has jumped by 1.5%, after hitting a three-month low on Friday night after its worst week since June. Sterling has risen against other major currencies this morning, as a crucial week of Brexit deal talks begins. The pound has hit its highest level against the euro in over a week, at (EURO)1.1003, and is also up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.28. Formal negotiations on the post-Brexit UK-EU trade deal resume tomorrow, with top negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost meeting on Friday. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is heading to Brussels today for talks with EC vice president Maros Sefcovic for talks. Given the disruption caused by Covid-19, both sides are under pressure to reach an agreement - ideally in time for an EC council meeting in the middle of October (Boris Johnson's imposed deadline). Most UK businesses have been unable to prepare for restrictions on EU trade, due to the pandemic, and are desperate for a deal that avoids chaos at the UK border. The prospect of queues of 7,000 lorries snaking across Kent does not appeal to CEOs already trying to cope with the latest rules on Covid-19. Mohit Kumar of Jefferies says: The last scheduled talks between the UK and Europe start this week and if there is to be an agreement by 15th October, then positive breakthrough should happen before end of the week. We are hopeful that a last minute deal would be reached, but the negotiations have become complicated following the recent UK Internal Markets bill, which is likely in breach of international law. Every sector on the FTSE 100 is up this morning, led by financials (+4%), real estate (+1.5), consumer-focused firms (+1.3%) and utilities (+1%). But, at below 6,000 points, the Footsie is still down over 20% this year: Drinks firm Diageo is also rallying, after reporting that its outlook has improved. Diageo, which make Johnnie Walker and Talisker whisky, Smirnoff vodka, Tanqueray and Gordon's gin and Guinness stout, has seen stronger sales in America, Europe, and China. CEO Ivan Menezes told the City: Our US business is performing strongly and ahead of our expectations, reflecting resilient consumer demand and the spirits category continuing to gain share within the total beverage alcohol market. Increased retailer confidence is resulting in some re-stocking in the off-trade channel. The on-trade channel is now open in all states, with some capacity restrictions. In Europe, off-trade demand remains robust and the on-trade channel has largely re-opened with the easing of lockdown measures in most countries, although the risk of additional restrictions remains where infection rates are worsening. In China, the on-trade channel continues to recover, although larger banqueting occasions are returning more slowly. Diageo shares have jumped by 5.5% to \u00a326.60, a two-week high. Britain's FTSE 100 has opened 1.3% higher, gaining 78 points to 5921. HSBC is the top risers, surging by 10% at the open after Chinese insurance group Ping An increased its stake in the banking giant. HSBC's shares hit a 25-year low last week, amid worries that US-China relations were worsening. Other European markets have also opened higher, with Germany's DAX gaining 1.7% and France's CAC up 1.4%. Here's Reuters' take on China's factory profits: China's recovery has been gaining momentum as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports propel a rebound. Industrial firm profits grew 19.1% year-on-year in August to 612.81 billion yuan ($89.8 billion), the statistics bureau said. That compares with a 19.6% increase in July and is the fourth straight month of profit growth. However, industrial firms' profits still face external pressures as rising tensions between Washington and Beijing cloud the global trade outlook. Raw material manufacturing profits increased by 32.5% in August, up from 14.7% in July, according to Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau. This was driven in part by a rebound in the prices of international commodities such as crude oil and iron ore, he added. More here: China's industrial profits grow for fourth straight month This chart shows how China's factory profits have been recovering steadily since cratering at the start of the pandemic. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There's an autumnal chill in the air this morning, but investors are warming to equities again after an encouraging jump in Chinese factory earnings. Profits across China's manufacturing companies have grown for the fourth consecutive month, government figures released over the weekend show. In August alone they jumped 19.1% year-on-year, as the world's second-largest economy continued to recover from the shock of the Covid-19 pandemic. This means that industrial profits so far this year are only 4.4% lower than in January-August 2019 -- quite a recovery, given the turmoil in the global economy. Raw material producers, equipment makers and electrical manufacturers all posted particularly solid jumps in profits The figures suggest that China's recovery gained momentum over the summer, as Beijing's stimulus efforts kick in. This is a welcome sign for the markets, amid fears that Europe's recovery could fizzle out in the next three months as rising Covid-19 cases. Stephen Innes of AXIcorp explains: Profits of China's major industrial firms remained on the steady path to recovery in August. Indeed robust earnings in China's colossal production and operations engines provided further evidence of a strong economic comeback. The data augers well for the China growth story and the outlook for commodity prices. So, after losing ground last week, European stock markets are set to rebound this morning. The UK's FTSE 100 is expected to gain over 1%, having flirted with a four-month low on Friday. Asia-Pacific indices have already posted gains, with Japan's Nikkei rising 1%, China's CSI 300 up 0.6% and South Korea's KOSPI rallying 1.3%. Also coming up today Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, is testifying to MEPs about the eurozone economy today. She may face questions about the strength of the euro, Europe's faltering recovery, and the prospect of another ECB stimulus package soon.

initial public offerings, approving an amendment to the country's securities law that also aims to better protect investors and prevent insider trading.Mainland authorities have recently stepped up moves to attract listings of big tech firms, including launching a new technology board in Shanghai in July, as the country's economy has stuttered to its slowest rate of growth since the early 1990's.'This amendment is a big breakthrough as it cuts red tape and the cost for companies when going public,' said Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute at Wuhan University of Science and Technology.\u00a0'It is the most significant revision of the Securities Law in history.'The new registration-based IPO system in the newly amended law \u2014 which comes into effect on March 1, 2020 \u2014 requires strict information disclosures from companies seeking to list.\u00a0The listings, however, do not need approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, according to a draft law published on Saturday.\u00a0It has also removed the need for companies to be profitable before listing.The revised law includes better protections for minority investors, said Gong Fanrong, director of the finance committee legal team under China's National People's Congress.It calls for companies to establish dispute resolution mechanisms to address shareholder grievances and improve transparency, he added.Companies found guilty of making false or misleading statements or withholding important information from shareholders could face penalties ranging from one to 10 million yuan ($ 143,000 to $1.4 million).It also includes tougher punishments for securities fraud and insider trading.\u00a0Individuals found guilty of insider trading will be fined two to ten times the value of their ill-gotten gains.Intermediaries and professional services firms found guilty of faking information during IPOs will be fined two million to 20 million yuan, compared to 300,000 to 600,000 yuan at present.The law also says securities industry employees, including regulators and those who work for brokerages or stock exchanges are bared from trading in stocks.Lawmakers have debated amendments to China's securities law for nearly five years.MENAFN3012201900280000ID1099490656</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

newly amended law -- which comes into effect on March 1, 2020 -- requires strict information disclosures from companies seeking to list.</p><p>The listings however do not need approval from the China

better protections for minority investors, said Gong Fanrong, director of the finance committee legal team under China's National People's Congress.</p><p>It calls for companies to establish dispute

This is the fourth story in a series that will detail the challenges private firms face and outline the government's attempts to address them.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a frustrating time for Chinese furniture makers like Jason Chen, whose meagre profits have fallen victim to the US-China trade war. But the dark cloud of that conflict has one silver lining: good technical workers are no longer so hard to find. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chen, who manages two factories that make wooden frames for sofas and tables in eastern China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, has not had to lay off any of his 600 staff despite the blow to his business. He was fortunate to have a mostly independent supply chain, but still had to scale down the workforce in the smaller factory and move them to the bigger factory to save costs.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>\u00a0 </p><p>In late October, he hired two experienced sample makers laid off by other factories. Their salary demands were \"not too high\", because there were few other jobs to be had. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2178708/can-chinas-leaders-restore-confidence-private-businesses\">Can China's leaders restore confidence to private businesses?</url></p><p>However, not everyone is fortunate and capable enough to spread risk between different baskets. </p><p>\"If between half and 70 per cent of one's business comes from the US market, then it's hard to survive,\" Chen said. \"I estimate that small manufacturers with fewer than 200 employees will disappear after January.\" </p><p>That is when US tariffs on US$200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including furniture, were initially<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>scheduled to rise to 25 per cent from the initial 10 per cent rate levied in September. But after Donald Trump and Xi Jinping met on December 1, the tariff increase was put on hold until March while the US and China continue trade negotiations. </p><p>The trade war has created an extra, unexpected burden for Beijing: to maintain enough jobs as the economy slows. This is particularly true, given the extra hardship they face, for private sector firms, which account for about 80 per cent of all jobs and 90 per cent of new jobs, according to government data. </p><p>Last year, China was the largest exporter of furniture to the United States, with US$11.3 billion worth. The tariffs have had a chilling effect on its 6,000-plus domestic furniture manufacturers, most of which are privately owned, and brought down the number of employees in the industry to about 1.1 million at the end of October, the lowest in three years, according to official data. </p><p>The top leadership knows well the importance of having enough jobs. In the statement that followed the latest meeting of the policymaking Politburo in December, stabilising employment was mentioned first, before efforts to stabilise finance, trade and market expectations. </p><p>On the surface, the job market seems well under control. The official survey-based<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>unemployment rate released by the National Bureau of Statistics remained unchanged at 4.9 per cent in September and October before falling slightly to 4.8 per cent in November, while the average jobless rate in 31 major cites was even lower at 4.7 per cent in November - compared with the global average rate of 5.7 per cent reported by the International Labour Organisation. </p><p>According to the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the government created more than 12 million new jobs in urban areas during the first 10 month of this year, achieving its annual target two months early. </p><p>But the overall numbers hid a stark difference in the available supply of labour between small and large firms. For private enterprises with a workforce of less than 100, job supply fell below demand in the third quarter, whereas large firms offered an average of 2.87 jobs for every applicant, according to the China Institute for Employment Research (CIER) at the Renmin University of China in Beijing.  </p><p>Using job data from April to September from recruitment website 51jobs, Song Xuetao, an economist from Tianfeng Securities, found that about 2 million vacancies disappeared over the six months and recruitment by private firms with 50 to 500 staff fell more sharply than for state-owned enterprises.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>\"Under the current economy, small and micro firms contribute 80 per cent of all jobs, around 70 per cent of technological innovation, more than 60 per cent of GDP and more than 50 per cent of tax revenues,\" said Dong Dezhi, an analyst from Guoxin Securities. </p><p>\"Turning around the businesses of small and medium enterprises<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>to help job creation is where we can make a breakthrough to stabilise the job market.\" </p><p>Beijing has certainly become a little restless as the trade war continues. In mid-November, the State Council drafted a policy paper containing proposals ranging from refunding the unemployment insurance contributions of companies that do not lay off staff to giving subsidies to jobless 16-to-24-year-olds.

Migrant workers in particular are being given subsidies, tax breaks and other financial incentives to \"return home and start up\" their own company. </p><p>Since the early 2000s, almost all new jobs in China have been created in cities. The labour market is facing challenges from two ends: industrial consolidation and automation reduce the job supply, while a shrinking workforce, rising labour costs and declining job market participation - driven down mainly by women leaving the labour force - all contribute to depressing the demand for jobs. </p><p>But thanks to a surge in service jobs, particularly at small companies, urban employment growth has remained relatively stable even as China's economy has slowed. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2179259/will-china-make-good-its-latest-promise-give-private-firms\">Will China make good of its latest promise to give private firms more access in a market that favours the state sector?</url></p><p>\"Both basic and advanced services are contributing to this [jobs] growth, but it's the basic services industries that have been the stronger growth driver in most recent years,\" read a recent report from The Conference Board, a New York-based research firm. </p><p>\"They have become the catch basin for the lower-skilled segment of the workforce, absorbing a large share of less skilled workers, presumably transitioning from legacy sectors.

The employment sub-index in the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>November Caixin<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>Purchasing Managers' Index for the service sector, which mainly captures small private firms, showed that the workforce in the service industry grew mildly in the past two months but could not offset downsizing in the manufacturing sector.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>A monthly survey from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business gauging more than 300 alumni, mostly executives at private companies, also showed<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>their intentions to recruit staff had plunged over the past two months to the worst level in six years. </p><p>In the export sector, hiring demand fell by more than half in the third quarter, according to the CIER, which partners with job hunting site Zhaopin to produce a quarterly report.  </p><p>The supply of new jobs declined even more in coastal cities such as Ningbo and Suzhou that rely heavily on international trade. </p><p>Meanwhile, job postings in the internet and IT sector, which had been fertile ground for well-paid service jobs, fell by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier. A senior executive at a mid-sized internet firm of about 1,000 employees, who preferred not to be identified, said she had raised performance targets to improve productivity, even though she had not frozen headcounts or laid off staff. She noted that many of the jobseekers knocking on her door came from the peer-to-peer lending industry, in which hundreds of platforms have collapsed since July after the government tightened regulations. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2179397/china-running-out-options-bolster-confidence-slowing-economy\">China running out of options to bolster confidence in slowing economy, analysts said</url></p><p>Earlier in October, reports of big tech firms such as Huawei, Tencent and Alibaba freezing recruitment shocked the public.

Short video platform Kuaishou recently stopped hiring through headhunters, according to a recruiter source. Meituan Dianping, a Hong Kong-listed online platform that generates most of its revenue from food delivery, this year reported about 250 job cuts - 0.5 per cent of its workforce. </p><p>\"Salary is a priority, but many candidates for tech start-ups care a lot about job stability at the moment,\" said Eva Li, a Beijing-based headhunter who helps tech companies find engineers. </p><p>For now, the transition from industrial (secondary) jobs to service sector (tertiary) jobs seems smooth, partly because a strong economy over the past few years has created many entry-level, low-skilled jobs - such as in package or food delivery - but boosting entrepreneurship to offset demographic challenges requires consistent government support, which is easier said than done, according to Gao Yuan, senior economist from The Conference Board. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2173560/what-does-opening-exhibition-giving-credit-soes-and-xi-jinping\">What does 'opening up' exhibition giving credit to SOEs and Xi Jinping say to China's private firms?</url></p><p>\"As growth continues to slow, it will become increasingly difficult for the government to maintain the balancing act between upholding employment stability and advancing structural reforms,\" Gao said.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>One risky factor for employment stability is the rise in Chinese worker protests in service industries, according to China Labour Bulletin (CLB), a Hong Kong-based non-governmental organisation that tracks labour strikes.

In January 2020, as part of a trade deal with the US, financial regulators said foreign banks could apply to own their onshore securities businesses outright from April 1, eight months earlier than expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In doing so, Asia's largest economy is finally opening the doors to its $21 trillion capital markets and forcing national champions such as Citic Securities and CICC to compete openly with the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For now, the frustrations of the past are forgotten. Once foreign banks have the right licences, they can trade securities and commodities, and manage wealth and assets, onshore for local and international clients, all in their own names.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's the theory anyway. No one is confused about the scale of the task ahead. Making money in China is never easy. Beijing spent the last two decades either keeping foreign firms at bay or grudgingly handing out marginally expanded operating licences.</p><p>Even pioneers struggled. In 1993 Morgan Stanley was the first New York firm to open an office in China. It went on to build two onshore brokerages, first with CICC, then with Huaxin Securities, underwriting a slew of first-time China stock offerings both on and offshore. Yet its Huaxin joint venture posted a net loss of $99.8 million in 2018 on revenues of $175 million.</p><p>UBS is another trailblazer, courtesy of its 2006 bailout of troubled Beijing Securities. It renamed the firm UBS Securities and crucially won management control, despite only owning 25%. Yet the brokerage pocketed a profit of just $10.1 million in 2018, down 76.5% year on year, on revenues of $824 million.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">David Chin, UBS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>In October 2019 UBS Securities was the first foreign bank to sponsor an IPO on Shanghai's new Nasdaq-style Star Market, helping Haohai Biotech to raise Rmb1.5 billion ($212 million).On the positive side of the ledger, Citi's JV with Shanghai-based Orient Securities generated profit of $179.1 million in 2018. But even that number must be seen in context. Citigroup posted global net income of $18 billion in 2018 and $19.4 billion in 2019, making its China business a few generous drops in the bucket.Every data point shows foreign firms lagging local rivals. Citic Securities, China's largest investment bank by assets, posted net profit of $1.73 billion in 2019 and $1.33 billion in 2018. Compare that with the $1.5 million in net profit posted in 2018 by the seven largest foreign JVs combined. And the fact that, according to Dealogic, while China's brokerages earned combined fees of $1.9 billion from all onshore equity capital markets deals in 2019, foreign banks generated revenues of just $106 million.\"Every international bank is tiny compared to local competitors,\" admits David Chin, head of investment bank, Asia Pacific and China country head at UBS.It's a view shared by his peers.\"Onshore investment banking in China is dominated by local players, and I have the feeling it will stay that way,\" says Shuntaro Nagashima, group head of international planning at Japan's Daiwa Securities.

What if Beijing backtracks or drags its feet again in the light of Covid-19 and the risk of global recession?Despite past events, that seems unlikely.\"China needs sophisticated capital markets and investment banking solutions to support its economy, an economy which will at some stage become the largest in the world,\" says\u00a0Werner Steinmueller, Asia-Pacific chief executive of Deutsche Bank.  <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Werner Steinmueller, Deutsche Bank\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>For that, it needs foreign help.As the coronavirus ebbs in China, regulators are making a show of rolling out the red carpet.On March 20, JPMorgan Securities (China), the US bank's majority-owned mainland brokerage, opened for business, offering clients primary research, client advisory work, and sales and trading.At the opening ceremony, Shanghai's Municipal Office of Financial Services stated its \"determination to further open its financial industry\" to foreign firms.Ten days later, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were given the nod by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to increase ownership of their onshore joint ventures to 51%; both filed for approval to China's securities regulator to do so last year.Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, founded in 2011 and based in Shanghai, offers proprietary trading of bonds and investment banking services.Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, an alliance with Beijing Gao Hua Securities formed in 2004, provides M&amp;A advisory and underwrites securities.As to the question of whether or not China is worth the candle, the answer is an unequivocal yes. It already dominates Asia's capital markets.Fees earned by investment banks in China-led deals in 2019 totalled $7.17 billion, accounting for 75% of all Asia ex-Japan revenues, according to Dealogic. The onshore figure that year, $4.77 billion, was nearly double the size of the offshore one ($2.4 billion), underlining the scale of the opportunity for foreign banks advising mainland clients both at home and overseas.\u00a0 Onshore investment banking in China has grown faster than the offshore part over the past 20 years. The onshore fee pool is now around two to four times the offshore fee pool in every given year\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0David Chin, UBS And the country has kept its foot on the pedal, even during the coronavirus lockdown. China accounted for 78% of all Asia ex-Japan ECM activity by volume in the first three months of 2020, according to Dealogic, and 77% of investment banking revenues. And those revenues are growing too.\"Onshore investment banking in China has grown faster than the offshore part over the past 20 years,\" notes UBS's Chin. \"The onshore fee pool is now around two to four times the offshore fee pool in every given year.\"That reinforces the view that two Chinas are emerging.One is a huge onshore market that caters to providers of everything from debt to derivatives, asset management to advisory.The other is the offshore part of the portfolio, as banks serve the needs of China's big corporates as they expand across the world.That bifurcation is only likely to accelerate as the world emerges from coronavirus and multinationals cut their dependence on goods made in the People's Republic.    Shanghai vice mayor Wu Qing and JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung at JPMorgan Securities (China) Company Limited's grand unveiling ceremony  DynamismInterviewed for this story, bankers were asked how much China would contribute to pan-Asia investment banking volumes \"\" including Japan \"\" by the end of the 2020s.Responses ranged from 50% to 80% \"\" not higher but never lower \"\" startling given the relative youth of China's capital markets and the fact that until quite recently the country didn't have a private sector.\"Within 10 years, the majority of all Asia capital markets [activity] will be strongly China related,\" says Toshiyasu Iiyama, senior managing director at Nomura Holdings and head of the Japanese firm's China committee. \"That share could actually be higher, depending on how fast China opens up its capital markets. Once the market is fully liberalized, the dynamism will kick in.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Toshiyasu Iiyama,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Nomura Holdings\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>A senior banker at a US firm in Hong Kong says: \"Within 10 years in Asia, of five managing directors working in every sector, be it TMT [technology, media and telecommunications], industrials, financial institutions or real estate, three will be mainland Chinese by origin. That is how important China will be.\"That might be egging the cake \"\" but the point remains. China is the future of Asia's capital markets, and foreign firms seeking a raft of new licences will surely get them. It will then be up to them to make it work.Morgan Stanley hopes its longevity and record of getting pioneering deals over the line will keep it ahead of the pack.\"Those foreign banks with the agility to adjust to rapidly changing regulations and market practices, with deep experience in integrating international best practices, and the commitment to serving clients onshore, will be best placed to succeed,\" says the firm's co-chief executive of Asia Pacific and chief executive of China, Wei Sun Christianson.Along with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and UBS are probably the gold standard in China. All have solid teams and strong brands. The trio \"\" in that order \"\" head Dealogic's ranking of all China ECM deals completed onshore and offshore in the 2010s by foreign banks.Goldman opened its first mainland office in 1994, making its name on deals such as China Telecom's $4.2 billion Hong Kong-New York listing, which raised $4.2 billion in 1997 against the backdrop of the Asian financial crisis.Its co-president of Asia Pacific, Todd Leland, has publicly expressed his commitment to owning 100% of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua at the \"earliest opportunity\". It's an ambition shared by most of its peers, including Morgan Stanley.Under a five-year plan announced last year and running until 2024, Goldman has said it will inject hundreds of millions of dollars into its onshore business. Over the course of 2020, it aims to apply for asset management and wealth management licences to run alongside its markets, advisory and investment banking businesses. Ahead of the gameUBS is also ahead of the game. In late 2018 it was given the nod to raise its stake in UBS Securities to 51% \"\" the first foreign firm to be granted the honour. The next step is securing sole control.UBS Securities has offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.Citi is in a slightly different position.It expects to exit its joint venture with Orient Securities in the second quarter of 2020, then to apply for a series of licences allowing it to trade securities, futures, foreign exchange and commodities.Christine Lam, chief executive of Citi China, says operating in China \"is no different to any other large market \"\" our priority is to replicate what we can do for clients in the US or the UK, or out of Singapore, for our global and local clients. China is a strategic priority for Citi globally.\"Deutsche Bank hasn't announced any new plans with Zhong De Securities, its alliance with Shanxi Securities. But in September 2019 the German bank was given the right to act as a lead underwriter on all forms of onshore bond sales.The type-A licence, issued by interbank bond market regulator Nafmii, grants Deutsche greater access to China's $13 trillion debt market, putting it on an \"equal footing with domestic banks in the debt capital markets,\" says Deutsche's Steinmueller. \"We have hired people for the syndicate team, and are up and running and pursuing our first deal. We have a great deal pipeline and we see tremendous opportunity here.\"On April 17, Credit Suisse was granted approval to become majority owner of its onshore JV, Credit Suisse Founder Securities (CSFS), raising its stake in the brokerage to 51% from 33.3%. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Wei Sun Christianson, Morgan Stanley</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Beijing-based CSFS sponsors and underwrites government and corporate bonds, as well as A-share stock offerings. Since October 2016 it has run a broking business in Qianhai, part of the southern city of Shenzhen.China won't just be a second or third home to US and European firms \"\" Japan wants to play its part too.It's easy to forget that until it was elbowed aside by Wall Street in the 1990s, Tokyo was Beijing's chief financial ally.When Bank of China floated a \u00a520 billion ($180 million) samurai bond in 1985, it was led by Nomura. When Citic printed its own \u00a530 billion samurai that year, it turned to Daiwa Securities for help.Those deals mattered at a key moment in China's development and the country never forgets a favour. In November 2019, Nomura Holdings secured a licence from the CSRC allowing it to run its own onshore securities trading, proprietary trading, investment consulting and asset management businesses.The new outfit, Nomura Orient International Securities, overseen by chairwoman Qing Yu and chief executive Dongqing Sun, is 51% owned by Nomura, with the rest controlled by two investment vehicles, Orient International Holding and Shanghai Huangpu Investment.Nomura's Iiyama says its onshore investment banking business is \"going to be a slow build out.\"The firm wants to be a full-service brokerage within five years, by which time it aims to have offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen.Qing, a well-known figure in Beijing who worked in the finance ministry for 20 years, was a pivotal figure in China's inaugural yen-denominated bond, printed in 1994. Nomura led that deal and the two sides have stayed in touch with each other ever since.\"Our deep relationships in China have been built over many years,\" notes Iiyama.Daiwa Securities is a rare returnee, having terminated its joint venture with Shanghai Securities in 2014 after years of underperformance. Now, it is back.In September 2019 it filed to own 51% of a new brokerage, with the rest controlled by Beijing State-owned Capital Operation and Management Centre, and Beijing Xicheng Capital. Both are investment vehicles controlled by the capital's municipal government.Daiwa hopes to secure an operating licence early in the fourth quarter of 2020, but its group head of international planning Nagashima admits the process \"may drag on until winter.\"      Economic colossusNot long ago China was a single-track market, where foreign JVs were restricted to underwriting stock offerings and doing a spot of trading. Now it's a financial and economic colossus run by technocrats desperate to emulate the power and prestige of Wall Street.\"China wants and is moving towards a large and fully professional and international-facing capital markets system, but a key prerequisite for that to happen is a freely transferable renminbi,\" says Steinmueller.But Beijing wants to do more \"\" and foreign firms know it.For proof, take a look at the operating licences they covet most. JPMorgan is focused on delivering its global product lines to clients onshore, notes the US bank's China chief executive Mark Leung. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mark Leung,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">JPMorgan</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Anything that is critical to our global and local infrastructure for us to stay competitive we will do,\" he says. \"So if you look at asset management, wealth management, investment banking, corporate banking, commercial banking, all of these are where we have a strong global presence and where we see the market opening up here and as important to get in.\"\u00a0\u00a0UBS's Chin says the Swiss bank will put the bulk of its resources to work expanding its reach into \"markets, banking, research and wealth management\", while Nomura's Iiyama has his eye on opportunities with high net-worth individuals.\"Wealth management is a huge opportunity,\" he says. \"The A-Share IPO market is very crowded and difficult to get into, particularly as a new foreign entity.\"Daiwa's Nagashima wants to secure four operating licences spanning investment banking, broking, asset management and proprietary trading.\"Investment banking is the main focus, but does not mean the other business areas will be disregarded,\" he says. \"Our aim is to act as a bridge between China and the world, and in particular with Japan.\"For many firms the chief focus beyond investment banking is on asset management and wealth management \"\" and for good reason.McKinsey projects the onshore asset management business to be worth more than $5 trillion by 2022, with the entire market, including trust firms, funds and insurers, to surpass $22 trillion in value the same year, generating $70 billion in annual revenues.On April 16, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issued draft rules set to open up China's $3 trillion trust industry to foreign investors.The article that requires foreign firms to have at least $1 billion in assets registered onshore at the end of the previous year \"\" a rule that has long hampered inward investment \"\"\u00a0 has been cut.Wealth management is another no-brainer.China accounted for 57% of all assets in Asia at the end of 2018, according to Boston Consulting Group. Our focus in China is to be complete but not comprehensive\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Mark Leung, JPMorgan Real estate consultancy Knight Frank reckons China had 373 billionaires at the end of 2019 \"\" a 206% rise in five years. Some of that wealth has found its way out of the country to the likes of London and Singapore, but most is still tied up onshore in stocks, funds and real estate, or lying around in deposit accounts.China knows it must find ways to manage better what it has onshore \"\" and foreign firms can help, though no foreign institution can do it all, nor would they want to.\"Our focus in China is to be complete but not comprehensive,\" says JPMorgan's Leung. \"We are not going to do everything. It's about putting our products on the ground in the right context and remaining focused on where we can add value to global clients coming and to Chinese clients.\"Perhaps the stiffest challenge in the years ahead is not securing the right licences but a tussle for talent that may become an all-out brawl.While banks are cutting staff in most markets, in China they're scurrying to hire.As part of its five-year plan Goldman aims to double headcount to 600 by 2024. UBS will also double staffing levels, hiring 400 new people over the next five years.\"Given how miniscule our market share is right now, it would bring us closer to something we aspire to,\" says Chin at UBS. \"It's not overambitious.\"The bank plans to hire locally and to relocate bankers to the mainland from Hong Kong and Shanghai.Nomura's Iiyama says the bank will boost its headcount to 200 by the end of 2020, then to 400 in 2022 and 500 in 2023. By then it aims to offer a full gamut of services, largely to Japanese clients working onshore, including wholesale banking, equities and fixed income trading, and asset and wealth management.Daiwa's team is on track to grow to 100 by the end of 2020, from 20 at the start of the year.But it is one thing to find the people you want and quite another to convince them to join. War for talentOver the last 20 years China's economy has become a machine, pumping out new billionaires every month, not to mention billions of dollars of fresh securities, yet talent hasn't kept pace. That presents a problem for banks keen to hire hundreds of investment bankers, wealth managers, analysts and traders.The problem isn't at the pointy end of business. Most big banks employ a power-player or two: Chin at UBS, Leung at JPMorgan and Christianson at Morgan Stanley.The problem lies further down the pyramid. Graduates from the best business schools still hanker to join the best Western banks. They have cachet and clout, as Euromoney found when quizzing some of the country's top MBA students in Beijing in late 2019.This group of graduates of a top domestic business school all saw the world the same way. They wanted to join one of JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs, the only names that came up over the course of a two-hour conversation that spanned everything from finance to football.But there was a problem \"\" they all wanted to live in New York, London or Singapore; anywhere but mainland China.\"I'll come back in 10 years when I've made my money,\" was a common refrain.That puts banks in a bit of a pickle. Some want to hire a few dozen bankers each year; others, a few hundred.\"The war for talent is amazing,\" says a Shanghai investment banker. \"Imagine a country with 1.4 billion people and not enough talent in a key industry. But that's the reality.\"Head-hunters in Hong Kong and Shanghai are working overtime to meet their clients' needs. It isn't easy, given they all want the same thing: bankers who are, notes Chris Wong, head of China at recruiter Selby Jennings, \"not only good on paper, but who have necessary experience and exposure to the market. It is a must to have good technical skills and an ability to present well.\"The perfect candidate, the \"~unicorn', does exist, but how likely is that person to want to move?\" he asks. High demandAn additional problem is that most good China-focused bankers \"know their value and are in high demand\", he says, not just from investment houses but from big-tech and private equity.This quest for the best is tricky, as banks are exacting and finicky employers.\"Talent identification and retention is an important part of our business,\" says Morgan Stanley's Christianson. \"Offshore and onshore, not only are our people highly capable, bilingual and bi-cultural, they also have deep experience and long records of service at Morgan Stanley and highly value professional integrity.\"\"It is difficult,\" adds JPMorgan's Leung. \"The challenge is to find global citizens who share the right culture with technical and local context. We are trying to deliver the firm on the ground with some China characteristics so that order can't change; we have a focus on culture and integrity.\"He says the US bank's ability to grow its business onshore \"is based on the speed of regulatory opening-up and our ability to hire the right people.\"\u00a0 Just because the market offers tremendous opportunities, it doesn't mean you should over-expand or invest too far ahead of the actual business opportunity\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Wei Sun Christianson, Morgan Stanley But finding even one person with strong local connections and an ability to navigate China's political and regulatory landscape isn't easy. And that's just one side of the coin: bulge-bracket lenders also want talent with a certain urbanity and ability to communicate in English.\"In Hong Kong, it's a lot easier to hire \"\" to fill an MD position I know where to look and how to hire,\" says UBS's Chin. \"It's very different in the mainland, partly because the talent pool suitable for an international firm is small.\"That is forcing head-hunters to look in all sorts of unlikely places.\"We have to be creative,\" says one recruiter. \"We've looked in the World Bank, at Chinese politicians with international exposure, at China's development banks.\"One expert asked to fill a senior role for a Western bank compiled \"an incredibly random list that looked in all sorts of unusual of nooks and crannies,\" says the recruiter. \"The person we found was strongly local, knew regulators, had some international experience and could present quite well to the board. He wasn't an obvious choice, and 10 years ago he probably wouldn't have been, but the world has changed.\"Some hires are a logical next step on ladder. In September 2019 Deutsche announced Jeffrey Peng as its new head of China wealth management, based in Shanghai.Peng was previously at Bank of Singapore, the private banking arm of OCBC Bank, where he built its asset management division and onshore securities business.So far, so normal: yet Peng will report to Rose Zhu, president and chairman of Deutsche Bank (China). Her colourful career includes a stint as personal translator to president Xi Jinping \"\" the kind of role one rarely finds on LinkedIn feeds.     Local partnersNot all firms have a recruiter on retainer. Nomura is relying on local partners to fill its top roles.\"Our mainland team is very localized,\" says Iiyama. \"Out of 100 people or so there, there are no Japanese nationals, though we have a Japanese national at the director level. I believe that is the way to be successful in China.\"He says his new hires \"know the country inside and out. Their world is China, they see what's going on at the governmental level, at the corporate and regulatory levels, what people in the street think.\" <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Shuntaro Nagashima, Daiwa Securities</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>That approach can work, given that once you eliminate the language factor, the talent pool, notes Daiwa's head of international planning Nagashima, \"is huge\".He adds: \"The people I have hired so far [in mainland China] are talented and experienced. Most of them are mainlanders, but some are returnees who have trained in places like London.\"Ten years ago, the answer for some was to hire a so-called \"~princeling' with links to the Party or big state firms. That helped boost deal volume, but when US regulators called it bribery, the fines came tumbling down the pipe.\"These days, even if you haven't done anything wrong, if there is a whiff of the \"~princeling', no bank will want to know you,\" says a recruiter.Some might look to hire from domestic brokerages, but even that isn't a great solution.A senior position at a Citic or a CICC, notes a mainland investment banker, \"offers a mainland banker name-recognition, power, kudos, remuneration. You can earn $1 million there as an MD and double that or better with bonus.\"Why give that up for the stress of a new, more complex job at a bank your clients may not know?Foreign banks are willing to pay for the right name. In January 2020, Credit Suisse hired Wang Jing as its new head of mainland China private banking, prising her from China Merchants Bank.Wang is on a reported $2 million a year plus a bonus of $1.5 million. She will report to China chief executive Zhenyi Tang, hired last year from Hong Kong brokerage CLSA, on a salary of $2 million, rising to $10 million after bonuses. Move to ChinaThen there is the task of convincing bankers, whether mainland \u00e9migr\u00e9s or foreigners, to move to China. The top rate of income tax is 45% in the People's Republic, against 22% in Singapore and 15% in Hong Kong. <table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Franck Petitgas,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Morgan Stanley International</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Even if you convince a banker to overlook that, many are put off by any number of issues, from language and cultural barriers to urban pollution.

Not in the short term.</p><p>\"There will always be a gap between the foreign and local players in China,\" says UBS's Chin. \"You only need to look to the US as a classic example.

There are many reasons, but ultimately domestic investment banks will always enjoy a natural competitive advantage.\"\u00a0</p><p>But China is a 100-year marathon not a 10-year sprint.

Here, dozens of Chinese\u00a0sorted through their buys from a\u00a0Shilla Duty-Free pick-up counter, taking advantage of the chance to buy products sold cheaper here than at home.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Working quickly to take off all the signs that these products were freshly bought, they hastily stuffed them into suitcases, a tactic to dodge customs' $5,000 goods limit on arrival back in China. Some were sorting products on the table but many had planted themselves on the ground, scratching away at the boxes and wrapping until a bed of packaging threatened to engulf them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shilla had five staff members on hand to distribute the blue plastic bags and continuously clean up the scene, which could pass for a tornado's path. As one plane departed for China, 26 carts filled with packaging were wheeled away.</p><p>While some people were stocking up for themselves or friends, much of this product would go on to be resold in daigou networks. Chinese tourist shoppers and enterprising resellers have made their footprint known nearly all around the world from Paris to New York but Jeju Island, in particular, has risen to one of the premier destinations for Chinese to engage in this kind of price arbitrage. It provides an easy location, just a 90-minute flight from Shanghai, and in contrast to the rest of South Korea, visa-free access to Chinese passport holders.</p><p>The cottage industry becomes evident as soon one embarks on a plane from China for the quick jaunt.\u00a0The duty-free shopping magazine aboard Korean Air's Shanghai-Jeju route is a 240-page tome, a kind of heftiness that recalls the golden days of publishing.\u00a0In lieu of a \"wake me for meals\" sticker, the airline provides \"wake me for shopping\" labels.</p><p>Seoul suffered when political tensions over the THAAD missile defense system saw China ban group tours from going to South Korea but Jeju proved resilient with its flow of parallel traders. Nonetheless, however well the island weathered those tensions then, the gray market that has prospered here and all across the globe could find it has met its match with China's new e-commerce laws.</p><p>The new rules that took effect on Jan. 1 were a wide-sweeping set aimed at regulating the e-commerce space. Although online shopping has exploded in the nation, expanding to approximately 30 percent of the country's total retail sales, there's been little government oversight until now.</p><p>\"The idea behind the law to protect consumers in China,\" said Jeff Unze, president of strategic partnership at Beyond, an app that specializes in cross-border shopping for Chinese consumers.\u00a0\"That's the intended purpose: to make e-commerce more fair.\"</p><p>\"You have a lot of resellers, and fly-by-night companies that come on to platforms, sell tens of thousands worth of product and then before products can be returned, or product quality is assessed they shut down and pop up as something else on Taobao,\" Unze added. \"It's really to protect the consumer, have better regulation to make sure everyone is paying taxes and working customer services, that everyone has legitimate products, and really force some of the bad actors out.\"</p><p>The new rules do a number of things. For one, it makes platforms such as Taobao and Pinduoduo at least in part responsible for the sale of counterfeit items. Failing to address claims of counterfeit items could lead to fines of up to 2 million renminbi.</p><p>It\u00a0also widens the channel for legitimate cross-border shopping, something on which Chinese consumers face spending caps.\u00a0\"The new law raises the tax-exemption limit for cross-border purchases, with the single purchase amount limit increasing from 5,000 renminbi (or $720 at current exchange) and the annual amount limit increasing to 26,000 renminbi (or $3,780 at current exchange),\" explained Rogerio Fujimori, analyst with RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>But causing the industry some anxiety is the increased scrutiny on the kinds of small internet businesses, the model that resellers rely on, requiring them to register for a license and pay taxes. It's a further tightening the screws on the gray market which has already been hurt by stricter border checks and a general move to lower tax rates on imported consumer goods.</p><p>\"Given that daigou primarily profit off of the markup between overseas products and those already sold in China, their margins will become even thinner and they may exit the business completely,\"\u00a0Azoya Consulting predicted.</p><p>In late September over a holiday period, Shanghai customs officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/china-border-enforcement-sends-chills-through-luxury-sector-daigou-1202868623/\">clamped down harshly on resellers</url>, increasing checks on travelers and even inspecting every passenger on a plane coming from Jeju Island. The move made luxury stocks tremble worldwide. Already then, traders started to recognize that the winds had shifted against them.</p><p>Mailing product from overseas to China as personal packages, another favorite method of resellers, has also dried up substantially.</p><p>\"With the postal method, the idea is the check rate is so low with customs, they can compete on it,\" Unze said. \"Last year, it was 2 to 3 percent. In 2018, it's been 20 percent. If suddenly you had to pay duties on 20 percent versus 2 percent, that presents a real big hardship.\"</p><p>Brands themselves can be expected to be hit in a ripple effect, at least in the short-term although many are optimistic it will redirect sales to official channels over time.</p><p>\"In the long-term, this is positive for the sector,\"\u00a0said Fujimori, \"as it establishes a more level playing field by curbing parallel trading [and] import duty avoidance, protecting luxury brands in Mainland China and supporting luxury e-commerce development, which is still in its infancy.\"</p><p>While how quickly the effects materialize depends on how the rules are enforced,\u00a0Nancy Zhang, head of partnerships at the cross-border e-commerce tech company BorderX Lab, said that \"up to 20 to 30 percent of what a company might assume are consumers in a home market could actually derive from resellers\" and that companies should be prepared.\u00a0In the U.S.,\u00a0\"we would encourage companies to do audits of their customer base. Look for signs such as shopping addresses known to be freight forwarding addresses in California, or Flushing, Queens, or Oregon,\" Zhang said.</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/the-death-of-daigou-china-ecommerce-1202941437/\">China's New E-commerce Laws Could Derail Daigou</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/trend-2019-watch-regulation-of-facebook-google-amazon-1202942656/\">What to Watch: Regulation of Big Tech</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/media-trends-2019-voice-devices-news-1202942252/\">What to Watch: Voice Devices Bringing the News</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WOWEDA-1202941437</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WOWEDA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V43-K1X1-DYJW-X06F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434863</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1116\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WWD</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000C5P4</classCode><className>AMOREPACIFIC CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC2844 PERFUMES, COSMETICS, &amp;

With more than $100 billion worth of loans and rising worries among Chinese consumers about privacy, Beijing is moving to rein in a freewheeling, well-funded boom in online personal loans.

In early December, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said it would crack down on unlicensed cash loan companies and put a lid on high-interest loans.</p><p>China\u2019s small loans are piling up. More than 8,600 companies offer some form of small loan, and about $145 billion of those debts remain unpaid, according to the People\u2019s Bank of China. Other estimates run as high as $392 billion, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The government does not track default rates among online lenders, which disclose little on their own.</p><p>\u201cWe are worried that in an environment where there is no effective credit system, people tend to overborrow, especially when capital comes in,\u201d said Bai Chengyu, an executive at the China Association of Microfinance, who is no relation to Bai Shichao.</p><p>These lenders originally emerged as a solution to that problem: how to lend to people with no credit history. By most estimates, that could total about one billion people.</p><p>China turned to the fast-moving technology sector.

Few details were provided.</p><p>The new online lending platforms also raise issues of privacy, a new but growing area of public concern in China. Many platforms that track smartphone use have access to data like location services, phone contact lists and call logs that can be used to track and harass delinquent borrowers.</p><p>\u201cThe government has struggled a lot because they realize that consumers\u2019 personal information is everywhere,\u201d said Liu Yue, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing. \u201cBut they don\u2019t really know how to change that because the data is already being used.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Bai of the China Association of Microfinance added that \u201csome cash loan companies use all kinds of soft violence to press customers to pay their loans back.\u201d</p><p>Last month, Guangdong Province in southern China warned that more than a dozen apps had security loopholes that allowed companies to steal user information. Some of this information was then used to harass borrowers and their friends and families.</p><p>One of those was an app called Paipaidai. Its parent company, PPDAI Group, recently listed its shares in New York. The Guangdong authorities said the app sends out users\u2019 contacts without permission. The practice \u201cseriously exposed users\u2019 privacy,\u201d the authorities said.</p><p>One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.</p><p>Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to \u201cuse whatever method to deal\u201d with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai.</p><p>Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China\u2019s most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree.</p><p>One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app \u2014 Yongqianbao, or \u201cuse wallet\u201d in Chinese \u2014 helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.</p><p>Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history \u2014 and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan. It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.</p><p>\u201cIt is hard to determine how the machine knows,\u201d said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance, \u201cbut it is much more accurate\u201d than a traditional loan officer.</p><p>Even borrowers like Mr. Bai who don\u2019t pay back \u2014 what Mr. Jiao calls a \u201ccontrolled delinquency\u201d \u2014 help the company by providing data, the company says.</p><p>Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system, \u201cbut there is still a long way to go,\u201d said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.</p><p>Mr. Bai said he received a $270 loan from Yongqianbao in September. Thanks to the high interest rate, the balance had grown to more than $330 by mid-November.</p><p>In exchange for loans, he has given lending platforms considerable personal information \u2014 and they are now using it. First they called the people he listed as emergency contacts, he said. Then they started calling other people on his phone contacts.</p><p>Some debt collectors sent him texts saying they could trace his location through his phone. \u201cIt is meant to threaten you,\u201d Mr. Bai said. That ability could not be independently verified. In addition to the thousands that he owes to cash lenders, Mr. Bai owes more than $2,000 for rent and other personal debts.</p><p>Mr. Bai said he now realized that it was not worth trading his privacy for quick cash. \u201cBut at that time, whenever I saw a cash loan service,\u201d he said, \u201cI wanted to borrow.\u201d</p><p>Follow Alexandra Stevenson and Cao Li on Twitter: @jotted and @caocli. </p><p>PHOTO: Bai Shichao, a deliveryman in Beijing, in his unheated room on the outskirts of Beijing.

The practice \"seriously exposed users' privacy,\" the authorities said.</p><p>One Paipaidai borrower, a man named Lin in a small town in Fujian Province called Quanzhou, said he had racked up about $75,000 in loans from 30 different platforms for living expenses and an investment in a shoe store. Mr. Lin, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of reprisal from debt collectors, said he received multiple calls a day from them.</p><p>Mr. Lin showed images of text messages from one called Yongsheng Outsourcing that threatened to \"use whatever method to deal\" with debt that he owed to Paipaidai. When contacted by The New York Times, a person at that number declined to say whether he worked for Yongsheng or Paipaidai.</p><p>Paipaidai did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Bai Shichao, the food deliveryman with the growing debt problem, tapped some of China's most closely watched and best-funded online lending services during his borrowing spree.</p><p>One of those was a company named Smart Finance. Its app - Yongqianbao, or \"use wallet\" in Chinese - helps it build a credit rating system based on 1,200 data points related to user behavior. Yongqianbao then connects potential borrowers with lenders. Backed by the venture capital vehicle of Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google China and a prominent start-up investor in China, it has approved 1.5 million loans a month.</p><p>Its algorithms look for correlations between behavior and repayment history - and some of those are unusual. Yongqianbao considers how quickly people type on their phones, how often they eat takeout or how much power is left on their smartphone batteries when they apply for the loan. It also evaluates whether the borrower took the time to read the Yongqianbao user agreement. Approval can come in eight seconds or less.</p><p>\"It is hard to determine how the machine knows,\" said Jiao Ke, a former Baidu product manager who created Smart Finance, \"but it is much more accurate\" than a traditional loan officer.</p><p>Even borrowers like Mr. Bai who don't pay back - what Mr. Jiao calls a \"controlled delinquency\" - help the company by providing data, the company says.</p><p>Smart Finance uses repayment behavior data to help strengthen its credit rating system, \"but there is still a long way to go,\" said Carrie Fang, a spokeswoman for Smart Finance.</p><p>Mr. Bai said he received a $270 loan from Yongqianbao in September. Thanks to the high interest rate, the balance had grown to more than $330 by mid-November.</p><p>In exchange for loans, he has given lending platforms considerable personal information - and they are now using it. First they called the people he listed as emergency contacts, he said. Then they started calling other people on his phone contacts.</p><p>Some debt collectors sent him texts saying they could trace his location through his phone. \"It is meant to threaten you,\" Mr. Bai said. That ability could not be independently verified. In addition to the thousands that he owes to cash lenders, Mr. Bai owes more than $2,000 for rent and other personal debts.</p><p>Mr. Bai said he now realized that it was not worth trading his privacy for quick cash. \"But at that time, whenever I saw a cash loan service,\" he said, \"I wanted to borrow.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Alexandra Stevenson and Cao Li on Twitter: @jotted and @caocli.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000005561970</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R8K-XVC1-DYR7-C4WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1290\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 25, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009S94</classCode><className>PEOPLE'S BANK OF CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002NOA</classCode><className>BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009CXY</classCode><className>TENCENT HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS541513 COMPUTER FACILITIES MANAGEMENT SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BABA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>0700 (HKSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001813</classCode><className>WAGES &amp;

Participants in GlobalData's 2018 Mass Affluent Investors Survey were asked to rank eight statements according to how much they affect them. More than a quarter ranked the statement \"I can't imagine living without technology\" within their top three, meaning only a few countries in the world place greater importance on technology. </p><p>Meanwhile 57.3% of Chinese investors state that they are \"always the first to try a new product,\" making them more open to new business models.As such, it is unsurprising that Chinese investors are also more likely to make use of automated investment services than their global peers. While only 4.2% of Chinese consumers use a robo-advisor as their primary investment provider, this is almost double the global average of 2.3%. And the proportion of individuals who have at least tried a robo-advisor stands at 31.8% in China, compared to 13.7% on a global scale.Admittedly, new entrants will face competiton from China's big tech giants, such as Ant Financial and Ping An-backed Lufax, as well as start-ups like WaCai. And the country's big banks including China Merchants Bank have developed their own robo propositions. Yet China's investment market is set to grow rapidly, meaning it is far from saturated.China's wealthGoing forward, growth will further be aided by a shift out of deposits and greater uptake of investment products. According to GlobalData's Retail Investments Analytics, Chinese consumers allocate 72% of their liquid wealth to deposits, while another 20% is allocated towards equities. The remainder is split between mutual funds and bonds. For a developing market, the proportion allocated to fee-bearing investment products is already relatively high. However, there is room for growth in India, for example, consumers only hold 56% of their liquid wealth via deposits. As the Chinese investment market continues to mature we expect the proportion of non-deposit holdings to continue to rise, further contributing to the development of the local robo-advice market.A growing middle class is another trend in favor of automated investment platforms. Millionaires and HNW investors are often the key focus in China's wealth market, with competion in this space increasingly fierce. But this is changing. Over the next four years, another 8.3 million individuals will qualify as mass affluent as per GlobalData's Wealth Market Analytics. This equates to another $1.7tn up for grabs, which constitutes a signficant opportunity for robo-advisors. Investment management companies should shift their focus to investors lower down the wealth spectrum, as the automation of investment processes is turning the masses into a profitable target market.China's regulatory environment can be uncertain, and more stringent government scrutiny and involvement is likely as robo-advice continues to develop. But this should not be enough to act as a deterrent. China's robo-advice market is taking off, and the opportunity is too good to ignore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-C3DD896F16E349CCA7B697DC8FA353E9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VB4-5511-JC0X-H00X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><timeReceived>11:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, it was bad day of epic proportions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Shanghai Composite nosedived 7.7% in its first day of trading following an extended Lunar New Year holiday --- its biggest drop since August 2015's notorious \"Black Monday,\" when global markets were rattled by China slowdown fears.</p><p>The tech-heavy Shenzhen Composite plunged 8.4%, its worst decline since 2007. Taken together, $445 billion in market value was wiped out as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread globally, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.</p><p>The latest: The outbreak has killed at least 362 people and infected more than 17,300 around the world. Hong Kong just announced further border closures, part of efforts to restrict travel from China.</p><p>A massive sell-off was expected. Chinese markets, which had been closed since January 23, needed to play catch up with the rest of Asia, whose shares were battered last week. Plus, business closures throughout the country are expected to dramatically knock earnings for the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>That may be one reason that stocks in Europe are higher Monday. US stock futures also point to gains.</p><p>But another shock on Tuesday could reverberate globally. The daily limit for most stocks to fall in China is 10%, so markets there could face another dramatic dive --- leaving investors rattled.</p><p>Tai Hui, JPMorgan's chief market strategist for the asset management division in Asia, told clients Monday that the bank still thinks economic activity \"should recover swiftly once the number of new cases comes under control,\" while warning of a \"challenging time ahead\" for stocks.</p><p>\"As the number of infections is still likely to rise in the weeks ahead, we would expect the Chinese onshore equity market to come under pressure,\" he said.</p><p>Much depends on the Chinese government's ability to maintain liquidity. The People's Bank of China said Sunday that it would inject tens of billions of dollars into Chinese markets to keep cash flowing to banks. Protecting the country's financial markets and economy is a top priority for the government, Laura points out.</p><p>Alphabet to cap off a stellar earnings season for Big Tech</p><p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, reports results for the final three months of 2019 after US markets close on Monday --- finishing a strong earnings season for Big Tech that's further boosted the market clout of companies like Amazon.</p><p>What's expected: Analysts are looking for Alphabet's revenue to have jumped by at least 19% last quarter. Goldman Sachs strategists note that the company is pioneering a longer term shift toward sources of revenue beyond advertising, such as Google Cloud --- so expect investors to pay attention to growth there.</p><p>Potential sticking points: Any comments on privacy and regulation and the update on Google Pixel sales, according to Bank of America.</p><p>It's also a big moment for Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who took an expanded role after co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down from their executives jobs in December. The shakeup has been popular with investors.</p><p>Investor insight: Alphabet shares are up more than 17% in the past six months. The S&amp;P 500 has gained roughly 8% in the same period. The company recently joined the club of $1 trillion public companies, but its market value has since slipped back down to $988.7 billion.</p><p>Even so, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple now account for 19% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap.</p><p>Ryanair troubles highlight Boeing's deep crisis</p><p>Ryanair wanted to carry 200 million passengers by 2024. But that goal could be pushed out by as much as two years due to delayed deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max, the company said Monday.</p><p>The budget airline, which expected only six months ago to add 30 737 Max jets to its fleet by summer 2020, thinks its first delivery will now come in September or October, my CNN Business colleague Hanna Ziady reports.</p><p>That's bad news for Ryanair, but also for Boeing --- damaging its relationship with one of the plane maker's biggest European customers. Ryanair is already seeking compensation for its losses.</p><p>In its most recent earnings report, Boeing detailed nearly $19 billion in costs associated with the 737 Max crisis. Yet that price tag could still increase significantly. Ryanair's problems show why.</p><p>Up next</p><p>Alphabet reports results after US markets close. </p><p>Also today:</p><p>The January ISM Manufacturing Index, a key gauge of the sector, arrives at 10 a.m. ET. US construction spending for December posts at the same time. The Democratic presidential primary kicks off in Iowa.</p><p>Coming tomorrow: Earnings season rumbles on with results from BP, Snap and Disney.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

There are the US companies that have missed out on business as a result of sanctions, and the Chinese groups that have had to find alternative supplies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there is one group that has emerged as a winner: the security hawks who say they saw it coming and who are now pushing Beijing to be more self-sufficient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the start of 2019, Washington has used sanctions to cut Chinese companies out of US supply chains, denting the telecoms group Huawei, China's supercomputer groups and eight of the country's leading artificial intelligence surveillance companies.</p><p>For many policymakers in Beijing, the inevitable trend is towards more decoupling of the two countries' tech supply chains. A truce in the trade war is unlikely to diminish the Trump administration's drive to place controls on exports of advanced technologies.</p><p>The result has been a decisive shift in China's approach to the industry. Beijing is accelerating its drive for technological \"autonomy\" to boost its control over its own supply chain in the face of political risks, such as further US embargoes.</p><p>To achieve technological autonomy, Beijing is pursuing strategies that often tread an uneasy balance between increasing its engagement with the outside world and shutting it out. For all the accusations China has faced about stealing other countries' technology, Beijing is now embracing international open-source, or free to use, collaborations.</p><p>China is also tapping overseas markets for talent, investing more in countries other than the US.</p><p>This acceleration of decoupling will not only affect US groups that rely on China's custom, it will also start to reconfigure the world's tech supply chain, as Chinese companies turn to countries they view as safer allies. The two superpowers are already bullying countries they buy from, and sell to, to take sides.</p><p>\"Three years ago, there may have been more people thinking that we could rely on some US technologies rather than developing our own,\" says Yan Ming, a director at the China Computer Federation, a research alliance. \"Now if someone is still saying that, I suppose they have just been sleeping for the past three years.\"</p><p>The Trump administration has justified its sanctions so far on the basis of national security concerns surrounding Huawei, as well as a foreign policy objective of preventing Chinese government repression of Uighur Muslims and others in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, which is facilitated by surveillance companies. But within China, these justifications are seen as excuses for a broader agenda: preventing the rise of China as a challenger to the US as a tech superpower.</p><p>China's fears are not unjustified. In November, the US commerce department proposed rules that would give the agency the power to review and block any transaction involving \"information and communications technology and services\" from a \"foreign adversary\".</p><p>US officials have expressed national security fears over a range of Chinese companies, from software tech giants Tencent and Alibaba to the state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, which is pursuing an estimated $US1 billion ($1.4 billion) contract with the Washington DC subway.</p><p>The officials say their concern is not limited to a few tech companies, but that all Chinese companies could be seen as threats because they are potentially subject to the ruling Communist party's control.</p><p>As a result, a whole host of Chinese groups are assessing their dependency on US technologies. The largest gap is in hardware, especially the design and manufacture of semiconductors and high-end chips, where China lags far behind the US. They also rely on the US for software, from Google's mobile apps for Android smartphones - which are now sorely lacking from Huawei's handsets - to Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Office suite.</p><p>More broadly, the Chinese and US tech industries benefit from knowledge sharing. That includes informal discussions within industry alliances and standards-setting bodies, some of which have already been curtailed by export controls on Huawei and other companies.</p><p>Although not subject to the same controls, US-origin software developed under open-source licences supports much of the basic infrastructure of the internet, and Chinese developers worry that their access may soon be blocked.</p><p>Beijing's response to the threat of decoupling dovetails with an ambition enshrined in its 2017 Cybersecurity Law, to ensure components of \"critical\" infrastructure are \"secure and controllable\" and \"autonomous and controllable\".</p><p>In light of US sanctions, Chinese experts now argue that the risk of supply-chain disruptions for political reasons should be taken into consideration when vetting components. That includes the knock-on impact of Washington's pressure on non-US companies. US officials have been pressuring their counterparts in Taiwan to stop its largest chipmaker from selling to Huawei.</p><p>\"Developing autonomous and controllable technology is a solution to being controlled by others,\" says Mr Yan. He adds that the Trump administration \"taught China a lesson\" when it temporarily imposed sanctions on telecoms equipment maker ZTE in 2018, taking the company to the brink of collapse. The lesson was: \"If you continue like this, you are controlled by others and you won't survive if I cut your supply chain,\" he says.</p><p>Although foreign products could in theory be certified as \"secure and controllable\", this push largely means stripping out foreign vendors, say cyber security companies. In a confidential directive revealed by the Financial Times, the central government told its departments and public institutions to replace existing computers and software with domestically made versions.</p><p>\"We're being uninvited to bid. We're not being allowed to even participate any more,\" Cisco's chief executive Chuck Robbins told analysts in August, referring to the company's business with Chinese state-owned enterprises.</p><p>For many countries, technology development nearly always requires piggybacking on international expertise. This year, China has driven engagement with open-source research collaborations - where individuals from around the world can contribute - as a way to circumvent US export sanctions.</p><p>Chips are a crucial part of China's drive for self-sufficiency because they are the building blocks for all forms of computer. In October, China's annual government-run World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, near Shanghai in eastern China, debated an open-source chip design project. Born at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V is a research collaboration that develops free-for-use designs for the basic architecture used in microprocessors - potentially meaning the end of reliance on Intel and Arm's proprietary designs.</p><p>Ni Guangnan, an IT industry veteran, argued at the Wuzhen conference that China has several options when it comes to chip design. Those designed by Intel and the UK-based Arm are subject to possible US sanctions, he said, while chips wholly designed in China, such as by Loongson and Sunway, are rarely used.</p><p>But, Mr Ni concluded, Chinese-made chips based on RISC-V architecture are not controlled by other countries and have a future in emerging markets.</p><p>China has faced plenty of other problems developing a competitive domestic chip industry. Companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei already use their own in-house designs for chips used in their smartphones. But designing other high-end chips, such as microprocessors used in high-speed servers that will be competitive with Intel's, could be more than a decade away, says Dan Wang, a tech analyst at the consultancy Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.</p><p>Chinese venture-capital investment in the US has fallen substantially over the past year as the money instead flows to countries that investors consider beyond US sanctions.</p><p>\"The Chinese are scouring the world for non-US semiconductor technologies to bridge the gap,\" says Bas Fransen, lead analyst at the consultancy TenX2, who has helped introduce Chinese investors to Indian chip designers. \"Particularly in Bangalore, you come across many Chinese company reps and also government officials looking for start-ups to acquire or invest in, and to persuade to move to China.\"</p><p>But beyond chip design, Beijing sees open-source projects as an opportunity for China's tech sector to expand. Not only does it underpin much of the technology behind the modern internet, but open-source software is also, for now at least, exempt under US export controls.</p><p>The ministry of industry and information technology, China's tech industry regulator, has recently encouraged Microsoft's GitHub, the world's biggest code-sharing platform and host of open-source collaborations, to expand in China. GitHub's chief operating officer Erica Brescia says Chinese officials told the company that open-source projects give a \"sense of security\" because of the lack of trade restrictions.</p><p>\"[Due to] the trade war, China's government and its big tech companies have realised it needs to push the development of its own domestic open-source ecosystem,\" says Mark Ma, chief executive of Open Source China.</p><p>The government is also stepping up its talent-poaching programmes to try to bring Chinese emigrants home and attract foreign expertise. Among them is the Thousand Talents Plan, which has continued despite the government telling civil servants and state media to stop mentioning it by name last year because of criticism in the US.</p><p>Headhunters in Silicon Valley describe how increased difficulties in the US, such as the tightening of visa rules for talented workers, have led to more Chinese engineers returning home after finishing their studies in the US.</p><p>\"Some of these [Chinese] researchers in the US do not feel fully safe [any more],\" says Zhang Monan, chief researcher on US and Europe at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, a government-sponsored think-tank.</p><p>The Chinese recruitment schemes offer a range of incentives, from tax subsidies and research grants to topping up wages in co-operation with large private sector employers. They often also provide office and laboratory space, and even help with recruiting local researchers.</p><p>Last year, the government announced a tax subsidy scheme designed to lure overseas talent to the Greater Bay area on China's south coast, giving high earners an effective tax rate as low as Hong Kong's, according to calculations by KPMG. Elsewhere, officials in Ningbo, near Shanghai, has said it will pay relocation costs of between Rmb150,000 ($31,580) and Rmb8m ($1.7m) to attract specialist tech workers.</p><p>Chinese government-backed recruiters have, over the past year, been more cautious about operating in the US. But while the Trump administration has scrutinised university staff with Chinese state funding, it does not seem that the US government is concerned about Chinese engineers leaving the country.</p><p>China's private sector is still able to move quickly to mop up talent - although companies under export sanctions, such as Huawei, are careful not to hire competitors' engineers who could be accused of bringing sanctioned technical knowledge to the country.</p><p>This push for chip self-sufficiency has boosted smaller private Chinese companies in the industry, according to Charles Kao, a private equity investor formerly on the board of Applied Materials.</p><p>\"The drive for tech decoupling has increased demand for Chinese start-ups,\" says Mr Kao. \"They used to be thought of as too high-risk and so had no market to sell to; now they're developing because there's demand domestically.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc78v8e1ynzs51p1conxf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y15-TTX1-JD34-V01X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1979\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Oliver[1] MoginRubin[2] MoginRubin Blog[3] Perhaps it is a welcome reprieve for Facebook, Google and YouTube. A competing video-sharing social media company based in China has drawn the attention of U.S. privacy officials and lawmakers, with a confidential investigation under way and public hearings taking place on Capitol Hill.Reuters broke the story that the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is conducting a national security review of the owners of TikTok, a social media video-sharing platform that claims a young but formidable U.S. audience of 26.5 million users. CFIUS is engaged in the context of TikTok owner ByteDance Technology Co.'s $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly two years ago, a deal ByteDance did not present to the agency for review.Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are concerned about censorship of political content, such as coverage of protests in Hong Kong, and the location and security of personal data the company stores on U.S. citizens.Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, invited TikTok and others to testify in Washington this week for hearings titled 'How Corporations and Big Tech Leave Our Data Exposed to Criminals, China, and Other Bad Actors.'While TikTok did not send anyone to testify, the company's recently appointed General Manager for North America and Australia Vanessa Pappas, formerly with YouTube, sent a letter indicating that it did not store data on U.S. citizens in China. </p><p>She explained in an open letter on the TikTok website, which reads similarly to that reportedly sent to the subcommittee, that the company is very much aware of its privacy obligations and U.S. regulations and is taking a number of measures to address its obligations.For nearly eight years Pappas served as Global Head of Creative Insights and before that Audience Development for YouTube. In late 2018 she was strategic advisor to ByteDance, and in January 2019 became TikTok's U.S. General Manager. In July her territory expanded to North America and Australia. Selecting someone who played such a leadership position for YouTube, widely used and familiar to Americans, to lead U.S. operations may serve calm the nerves of U.S. regulators. But given U.S. tensions with China over trade, security and intellectual property, TikTok and Pappas have a way to go.Some commentators think Facebook must enjoy watching TikTok getting its turn in the spotlight, especially since TikTok is a growing competitor to Facebook in the younger market. If just briefly, it may divert attention away from the attention being paid globally to the social media giant's privacy and data collection practices, and the many fines.It's clear that TikTok has Facebook's attention. TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos with special effects, did a great deal of advertising on Facebook. The ads were clearly targeting the teen demographic and were apparently successful. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said in a speech that mentions of the Hong Kong protests were censored in TikTok feeds in China and to the United States, something TikTok denied. In a case of unfortunate timing, Zuckerberg this week posted that 100 or so software developers may have improperly accessed Facebook user data.Since TikTok is largely a short-video sharing application, it competes at some level with YouTube in the youth market. In the third quarter of 2019, 81 percent of U.S. internet users aged 15 to 25 accessed YouTube, according to figures collected by Statista. YouTube boasts more than 126 million monthly active users in the U.S., 100 million more than TikTok. Potential counterintelligence 'we cannot ignore' Last month, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) asked Acting Director of National Intelligence to conduct a national security probe of TikTok and other Chinese companies. Expressing concern about the collection of user data, whether the Chinese government censors content feeds to the U.S., as Zuckerberg suggested, and whether foreign influencers were using TikTok to advance their objectives.'With over 110 million downloads in the U.S. alone,' the Schumer and Cotton letter read, 'TikTok is a potential counterintelligence threat we cannot ignore. Given these concerns, we ask that the Intelligence Community conduct an assessment of the national security risks posed by TikTok and other China-based content platforms operating in the U.S. and brief Congress on these findings.' They must be happy with Sen. Hawley's hearings.In her statement, TikTokGM Pappas offered the following assurances: U.S. user data is stored in the United States with backup in Singapore \u2014 not China. TikTok's U.S. team does what's best for the U.S. market, with 'the independence to do so.' The company is committed to operating with greater transparency. California-based employees lead TikTok's moderation efforts for the U.S. TikTok uses machine learning tools and human content reviews. Moderators review content for adherence to U.S. laws. TikTok has a dedicated team focused on cybersecurity and privacy policies. The company conducts internal and external reviews of its security practices. TikTok is forming a committee of users to serve them responsibly. The company has banned political advertising. Both TikToc and YouTube have been stung by failing to follow the rules when it comes to the youth and children's market. In February, TikTok agreed to pay $5.7 million to settle the FTC's case which allege that, through the Musical.ly app, TikTok company illegally collected personal information from children. At the time it was the largest civil penalty ever obtained by the FTC in a case brought under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The law requires websites and online services directed at children obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from kids under 13. That record was smashed in September, though, when Google and its YouTube subsidiary agreed to pay $170 million to settle allegations brought by the FTC and the New York Attorney General that YouTube was also collecting personal information from children without parental consent. The settlement required Google and YouTube to pay $136 million to the FTC and $34 million to New York. Quality degrades when near-monopolies exist What I am watching for here is whether (and how) TikTok and other social media platforms respond to these scandals by competing on privacy.For example, in its early years Facebook lured users with the promise of privacy. It was eventually successful in defeating competitors that offered little in the way of privacy, such as MySpace, which fell from a high of 75.9 million users to 8 million today. But as Facebook developed a dominant position in social media through acquisition of competitors like Instagram or by amassing data, the quality of its privacy protections degraded. This is to be expected where near-monopolies exist and anticompetitive mergers are allowed to close.Now perhaps the pendulum is swinging back. As privacy regulation and publicity around privacy transgressions increase, competitive forces may come back into play, forcing social media platforms to compete on the quality of their consumer privacy protections once again. That would be a great development for consumers.Edited by Tom Hagy for MoginRubin LLP.

nitf:lede=\"true\">Smartphone maker Xiaomi on Monday became the first Chinese company to announce plans to issue securities on mainland China markets under a trial programme aimed at encouraging the country's tech giants to list at home.</p><p>Xiaomi, one of the world's largest smartphone manufacturers that is planning a primary listing in Hong Kong, said in a regulatory filing that it will also issue Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDR) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p><p>After watching technology heavyweights Alibaba and Baidu list on Wall Street, Chinese authorities have devised a programme under which companies listed outside the country can simultaneously list CDRs at home.</p><p>The objectives of the plan include helping to develop China's still relatively immature and volatile share markets while allowing domestic investors to invest in the country's big tech champions. </p><p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) finalised the rules governing the trial programme last week but it remains unknown when it could start.</p><p>Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent have expressed an interest in the plan.</p><p>Xiaomi's filing said the CDRs would be listed at the same time as its main debut in Hong Kong, with its initial public offering expected to raise $10 billion, valuing it at $100 billion.</p><p>That could make it the world's biggest IPO since Alibaba's $25 billion debut in 2014 in New York.</p><p>Beijing-based Xiaomi provided no specifics on the number of CDRs to be issued or a timetable.</p><p>But it said 40 percent of the funds raised through CDRs would go to global expansion and the rest on product development and expansion of its mobile internet ecosystem. </p><p>Xiaomi shipped 28 million smartphones worldwide from January to March, an 88-percent surge year-on-year.</p><p>That was fourth in the world after Samsung, Apple and China's Huawei, according to figures from the International Data Corporation (IDC).</p><p>Companies must show at least three years' profit before they can list in China, ruling out cash-burning start-ups.</p><p>But China also is discussing relaxing such restrictions to allow a new generation of emerging technology titans to list at home.</p><p>China has more such \"unicorns\" -- start-ups valued at a $1 billion or more -- than any other country, including Alibaba's mobile-payments pioneer Ant Financial, ride-sharing's Didi Chuxing, and online-services platform Meituan-Dianping.</p><p>Alibaba</p><p>SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

From this, we can see while Hong Kong may still lead Taiwan in terms of the judiciary's authority and credibility, but when it comes to understanding the political side of judicial disputes, the Hong Kong government lags far behind Taiwan. The Occupy protests and the Sunflower movement are both political incidents, not judicial affairs. If [Hong Kong<person><nameText>Chief Executive] Leung Chun-ying's </nameText></person>government continues to execute orders from Beijing and continues to politicise judicial procedures, as Taiwan starts reforming its judiciary, it is only days before Taiwan's judiciary will become better than that of Hong Kong.\" (Editorial, 31) <url normalizedValue=\"http://bit.ly/1Z9DKAP\">http://bit.ly/1Z9DKAP</url></p><p>Competition ranking</p><p>The Switzerland-based Institute for Management Development ranked Hong Kong as the most competitive city out of 61 economies included in its annual report yesterday.

There is no doubt that Hong Kong's outstanding performance in its international competitiveness is brought by the city's sophisticated banking and finance system, its policy that encourages innovation, its comprehensive rules and regulations, simple tax rates and the freedom of capital flow.

The big news this week is a surprising bifurcation in investor attitudes toward China and south-east Asia. The bloom is coming off the China story, while in Singapore, Indonesia and elsewhere an extraordinary boom is gathering pace. Elsewhere, Taiwan is getting tougher toward China and Vietnam is surfing a wave of digital money.</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story \u2014 Exclusive</p><p>A big chill is stealing\u00a0 over China\u2019s tech sector, delaying share flotations and slashing company valuations as the impact of US-China tensions and waning investor appetites takes hold. By contrast, south-east Asian tech companies are enjoying a stellar investment boom.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key Implications:</emphasis>\u00a0A glance at the private equity flows into China and south-east Asia so far this year shows a clear fork in the road. South-east Asian tech companies \u2014 led by firms in Singapore and Indonesia \u2014 have attracted $5.85bn in investments, up more than 10-fold from the same period last year. This nearly matches the rather meagre $6.3bn that has gone into China\u2019s tech sector so far this year \u2014 a slump from $16.3bn in the same period last year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis>\u00a0Some are calling this the onset of a \u201ccapital winter\u201d for China.

That\u2019s down $200m on the amount that bankers said it was targeting last year, further evidence of falling Chinese tech valuations. There is a case for optimism, however. NYSE-listed shares in rival Chinese streaming platform Huya, also backed by Tencent, have risen 86.5 per cent from its $12 issue price at IPO in May 2018.</p><p>DouYu, which streams esports matches and other games-focused content in China, reported adjusted net loss for the 2018 financial year had sharpened by more than a quarter from a year ago to Rmb818m ($119m).</p><p>Smart data</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A bit more detail on the divergence in deal flow between China and south-east Asia</emphasis>.

This, certainly, has been where to look for the action in equities. By late summer 2018, the FAANGs had accounted for about half the growth of the S&amp;P500. For the rest of the year, things were not so rosy, and they have done their fair share to drag the index down.\u00a0</p><p>However, tech megacap investment does not stop at US border control. Other behemoths are available, originating in China. In keeping with the vampiric theme, these are the BATs: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu has been dubbed the Google of China; Alibaba is an online retailer, broadly comparable to Amazon, and Tencent has a social media platform and huge gaming business.\u00a0</p><p>Does owning the BATs bring diversification benefits, or do investors simply double down on their tech bets?\u00a0</p><p>Singapore-based Chetan Sehgal, lead portfolio manager of Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust, says these stocks \"are correlated to a significant degree, so there is a doubling down on tech to an extent\". However, he adds, this is not fixed. For about three years, the BATs and FAANGs were highly correlated. Then, in March 2018, they began to decouple - something that has recently reversed: \"This is probably because of trade tensions, policy issues and the slowing of the BATs' local markets.\"\u00a0</p><p>Rebecca Chesworth, senior ETF strategist at SPDR, SSGA, is bullish over the benefits of BATs: \"Normally, we see greater opportunities for sector over country, but we have a clear preference for EM [emerging markets] over DM [developed markets] at the moment - and EM Asia specifically - following significant underperformance last year. The tide is now turning.\" This, she says, is because EM Asia equities are benefiting from mean reversion, and investors' realisation of better-quality earnings and lower gearing with the BATs, plus the fact that European investors are more underweight EM versus historic averages than any other equity region.</p><p>It is tempting to see tech as tech, but the stocks are serving different markets with contrasting business models. Richard Clode, portfolio manager on the global technology team at Janus Henderson Investors, agrees that there are diversification benefits from owning both US and Chinese internet names, stemming from the fact that \"the US internet giants are very much an ex-China story, while the Chinese internet companies are domestically orientated.\"\u00a0</p><p>&lt;blockquote&gt;</p><p>\"More internet regulation in the US could potentially force the break-up of some of the FAANGs\"</p><p>Richard Clode</p><p>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p><p>It is certainly the case that BATs' earnings are highly China-focused. Just 1% of Baidu's, 5% of Tencent's and 11% of Alibaba's revenues come from outside China. The rest tend to be focused on Asia. The FAANGs are truly global operations.\u00a0</p><p>But if the BATs do not have global reach, Chinese markets matter. Forget Black Monday and New Year sales: China's Singles' Day, falling on 11 November, is the world's biggest shopping spree, with Alibaba making $30.8bn (EUR27.3bn) on the day last year.\u00a0</p><p>Clode points to the \"much weaker and fragmented offline offering\" as being an advantage for Alibaba in particular. \"While Amazon competes with the likes of Walmart, Alibaba has no national scale offline retail competition to speak of,\" he says.\u00a0</p><p>&lt;h4 &gt;Listing impact&lt;/h4&gt;</p><p>While Tencent is Hong Kong-listed, Baidu and Alibaba list on the Nasdaq and NYSE respectively. Although Clode says that listing venue does not make a huge difference, he adds that the investor base is very different between the two markets, as Hong Kong-listed stocks have benefited in recent years from southbound Connect flows from mainland Chinese investors, while US-listed Chinese names can suffer from US investors using them as a proxy for global trade tensions or China concerns, which would have more of an impact on Baidu and Alibaba.</p><p>Sehgal is adamant that where the BATs are listed does have an impact, explaining that Tencent's Hong Kong listing gives it access to considerable investment flows from the Chinese mainland. \"On the other hand,\" he says, \"when emerging markets suffer outflows, the company is more vulnerable. But I think it's logical that Baidu and Alibaba will take dual listings eventually.\"</p><p>Certainly, US action is limiting the spread of the BATs. Alipay, the Ant Financial online payment platform, was blocked from buying the US's MoneyGram, while Singapore-based Broadcom's proposed takeover of San Diego-based chipmaker Qualcomm met with the same result, both on the grounds of national security. It is conceivable, however, that these actions could be net positives for investors, limiting cash burn on acquisitions and making such stocks more specific Asian plays, so enhancing diversification benefits.</p><p>Clode says the tariffs will have a limited impact on Chinese internet companies, given that they are predominantly domestic businesses. Nevertheless, he says, they will be affected by export restrictions on semiconductors.\u00a0</p><p>Apart from fundamental drivers, differences in regulation in their markets also has a significant impact, and it is working in the BATs' favour. \"The political climate in the US is clearly getting more confrontational with big tech in the US,\" says Clode. \"We expect more internet regulation in the US. This could potentially force the break-up of some of the FAANGs.\"\u00a0</p><p>That the FAANGs face greater regulatory hurdles \"makes a lot of sense\", says Chesworth. \"Western mega caps face political issues that their Chinese counterparties don't. The political interference that has hit Facebook is unlikely to disappear altogether, and US politicians are unlikely to want Google to get any bigger.\" On the other hand, while Beijing has always been interventionist, it has generally been supportive of domestic champions, creating a regulatory framework that has effectively shut out most US tech companies.\u00a0</p><p>The other big plus point for the BATs is data privacy, where Chinese companies have a lot more wiggle room, just so long as they play ball with the government.</p><p>So, says Chesworth, while equities may be out of favour, \"the marriage of tech and China is something that should excite investors\".\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IPEMAG-10029812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IPEMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJW-NDV1-F14V-80HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">349989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IPE International Publishers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investment &amp;

Its first outside mainland China was built in Singapore in 2015, and there are 15 now spread through Australia, Japan, Europe, the Middle East, and the U.S.  More are planned for India and Indonesia in 2018.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, Huawei Technologies, one of the world`s biggest telecom equipment suppliers and a major handset maker, announced in November it will invest at least $10 million next year in a data center in Thailand located in the Eastern Economic Corridor, which adjoins the Eastern Seaboard along the Gulf of Thailand. The center will host some of the country`s public sector cloud services, including a natural disaster warning system.</p><p>Shenzhen-based Tencent Holdings, the world`s largest games company by revenue and China`s biggest social media operator, reportedly also has plans for Bangkok, and is considering India, Russia, Japan, and the U.S.</p><p>Search giant Baidu is meanwhile developing technologies and information systems that will regionalize its web products for Southeast Asia, including its flagship search engine. The company opened a research center in Singapore in 2012.</p><p>Tencent and Baidu did not respond to the Nikkei Asian Review`s questions about their expansion plans.</p><p>Fourfold growth by 2025</p><p>China`s interest is a response to surging demand in Southeast Asia for digital services, including e-commerce, mobile payments, and internet access. Some regional governments are also showing signs of wanting to retain certain data on home turf.</p><p>Southeast Asia`s internet economy covers everything from games to online travel and ride hailing, and its expected turnover this year is $50 billion. On the present growth trajectory, it should grow fourfold by 2025, according to a joint report by Google and Singapore`s Temasek Holdings in December.</p><p>The report expects Southeast Asia to have 330 million active internet users by the end of 2017 -- equivalent to the population of the U.S. and 70 million more than in 2015. Sales of goods through e-commerce will reach $10.9 billion in in 2017, almost double 2015.</p><p>The sums involved are too large for Alibaba Cloud to ignore. Its data center in Kuala Lumpur will \"support the growth of small and medium enterprises and other businesses in the region\", said Simon Hu, the company president.</p><p>The cost of the Kuala Lumpur data center has not been revealed, but its products include elastic computing, database services, networking, security, middleware, analytics, and big data. The main target clients are large corporations and smaller internet companies offering games, multimedia, and financial services. The government sector is also a potential client.</p><p>Explosive digital needs</p><p>While there are no authoritative figures available for Southeast Asia, U.S. business consultancy Frost &amp; Sullivan estimates the data center services market in Asia-Pacific will grow at a compound annual rate of 14.7% between 2015 and 2022, reaching almost $32 billion by 2022. \"The key theme driving growth across the Asia-Pacific is the explosive digital needs of emerging economies with huge populations such as China, India and Indonesia,\" the company said.</p><p>The sector was initially driven by Google and Amazon.com, with Singapore as the location of choice due to its proactiveness in terms of tax incentives, business environment, and infrastructure. Google kicked off in 2011 with a $120 million investment in a regional data center there. Chinese rivals are showing themselves more prepared to venture beyond Singapore, and various regulatory requirements could encourage that trend. The Indonesian government, for example, is requiring that businesses conducting electronic transactions must store their clients` personal data inside the country. Other Southeast Asian countries have yet to follow this, however.</p><p>The Chinese are taking on Western heavyweights, and will face challenges recovering their investments. For Alibaba, \"right positioning, pricing, and local alliances will be the key to success,\" according to Baseer Siddiqui, a consultant at IDC in Malaysia, a U.S.-based market intelligence company.</p><p>Changing landscape</p><p>Baseer told the Nikkei Asian Review that some enterprises prefer providers like Amazon.com and Microsoft because they offer better service capabilities, process maturity, and have already evolved best practices for the tech environment. Although IDC expects the landscape will change with Alibaba Cloud`s arrival, he believes a lot of effort will be needed to build \"trust and confidence\" -- among many challenges.</p><p>Tencent`s overseas data centers mainly serve Chinese enterprises expanding internationally, or foreign companies developing in China. The centers offer globalized business solutions for video livestreaming, game servers, artificial intelligence, networking, and security services.</p><p>John Choi, head of China internet research at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong, said that there is still a big gap between Chinese internet companies and their global peers in terms of research and development spending, particularly on artificial intelligence that is so critical to cloud computing. He expects the gap to narrow in the coming years because of strong government support, more research funding, deep pools of talent, and private investment. 2017 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FISVMW-105826719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FISVMW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R66-G751-F11P-X4G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Financial Services Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35457\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 16, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009CXY</classCode><className>TENCENT HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BABA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>0700 (HKSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N551112MM</classCode><className>HOLDING COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Tuesday, September 10th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump is doubling down on the China trade fight. He is now touting how the tariffs are hurting China's economy. Plus the need for a is t touting how the tariffs are hurting China's economy, plus the need for a fair deal for the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm speaking with Georgia Senator David Perdue coming up. He was in China last week. He held a meeting with China's Vice Premier Lui He. We'll talk about the farmers as well and the impact there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are lower. We're now at the lows of the morning. Dow futures down 47 points. S&amp;P futures down 6. Nasdaq futures, lower by 24. This after modest moves yesterday on Wall Street for the major averages. The Dow was up for the fourth session in a row but the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq edging lower slightly yesterday at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this and as you can see it is down across Europe. FT 100's down 19, CAC 40 in Paris down 25, and the Dax index lower by 8 points.</p><p>We're going to hear from the ECB on Thursday. We'll hear whether plans for stimulus are in the cards.</p><p>In Asia overnight, take a look at the indices there. It was largely a higher opening. Shanghai composite though was in the negative column. The producer price index in China for August fell eight-tenths of a percent year over year. That was the worst contraction since August of 2016.</p><p>Meanwhile, the price of pork is soaring. It is up 47 percent year over year due to the swine fever outbreak in China.</p><p>Juul is on the hot seat -- the vaping giant called out by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing its products as being safer than cigarettes. Now, more states are looking to curb use of vaping by minors. A lot of issues around that -- safety issues.</p><p>Plus, it is Apple's big day. The technology giant set to announce new iPhones today. We're going to take you live to Apple Park, get a look at what to expect, phones coming out.</p><p>Plus the fast food wars hit the breakfast table, details on Wendy's big bet on breakfast.</p><p>All that coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; commentary writer with the \"Washington Examiner\" Tiana Lowe is here; and associate editor at Barron's Jack Hough. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JACK HOUGH, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, BARRON'S: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TIANA LOWE, COMMENTARY WRITER, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's on your mind?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Breakfast.</p><p>Hash browns -- Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I thought you were going to say Brexit because that's also on our minds.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The market, the economy -- I was reading an article that was in the \"Wall Street Journal about -- going back to 1928, the S&amp;P has fallen on average only in three months during the year. September proving to be the index's worst month of the year going back to 1928. So there's some concern that will this year be a repeat of what happened last year when you saw the S&amp;P peak in the fall. Then you had that big -- but that was the interest rate related. Not lower interest rate but higher interest rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: September is always a tough month, right. And October. Obviously you've got all the big sell-off in October.</p><p>HOUGH: I have no doubt that the market is headed higher from here because the stocks are still such a good deal relative to bonds and everything else. The problem is, when you think about the amount of stimulus -- people who are looking for stimulus right now, think about it, the fed funds rate is less than half its historic average, right.</p><p>And the federal government is spending a trillion dollars more than it brings in in revenue. So that's massive stimulus. So here problem is when that next economic downturn comes -- I don't see it in the immediate horizon -- but when it comes, how much are we going to have left to boost the economy?</p><p>You know what I mean? How much dry powder are we going to have when the next recession that will hits.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, especially right now when you're tired rates where they are right now.</p><p>There's not a lot wiggle room there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Even if you shoot me with stimulus -- we're going to have to get creative.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Unless you're going to go the Germany route.</p><p>MCDOWELL: we're going to have to get creative. And they reasons, we talked about this yesterday with the reason that you have such low rates around the globe in terms of those set by central banks is because of if the high debt levels that these nations -- and the United States is falling into this camp, because of these giant -- the giant debts that they accumulate, particularly in the last 10 years or so -- we can't handle higher interest rates and what kind of drag is that on the global economy long-haul?</p><p>TIANA LOWE, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I mean we're creating towards a crisis. Highest debt to GDP since it world two and we're not in any major international conflicts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's interesting that the markets don't seem to be worried about that. You've got There's $22 trillion in debt. The markets don't worry about it until they worry about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: More and more people are coming up to me on the ground, and these are like hard core country voters asking about us. What about the -- right, where are these the conservatives because you're supposed to be conservative about the debt and the deficit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact fiscal discipline in the Republicans.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO On the big tech anti-trust lawsuit. We're going to get into it. What might we see coming out of these lawsuit?</p><p>Former deputy national security adviser for President Trump K.T. McFarland is here on foreign policy, along with technology expert the cyber guy, Kurt Knutsson on the major Apple event today. They're going to be unveiling new phones. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And our top story this hour is China trade negotiations. President Trump takes aim at China's abusive trade policies, doubling down on his long kept promise to secure a strong deal for the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: China has taken advantage of our country for decades. They steal our intellectual property -- so many other things. So now it's just different. And now it's working the other way and Now it's working the other way and tariffs are a beautiful thing when you know how to use them, they're a beautiful thing.</p><p>We're going to be talking next week. We're talking now. They're going to be coming to the United States in two or three weeks and we'll see what happens. But unless we're going to make a good deal or a fair deal for our country to China become let's face it, we cannot go back to a situation, we're giving hundreds of billions of dollars to China becomes standard fare. Not going to happen. We can't do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: It comes as both sides work toward a truce with the next round of face-to-face negotiations likely early next month, early October in dc. My next guest just returned from China where he met with top trade negotiators.</p><p>Joining us right now is Georgia Senator, member of the Budget Banking and Armed Services committees, and former Reeboks and Dollar General CEO, David Perdue. Senator -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>SENATOR DAVID PERDUE, (R) GEORGIA: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>We want to talk china with these -- got this unique perspective. Both as a current lawmaker and the former CEO of retail giants that were in China likely to affect they get affected pretty by the tariff fight. You're just back from China -- what have you learned.</p><p>PERDUE: Well, Senator Danes and I were over there last week as a part of an ongoing effort to develop a relationship with their national people's congress. We met with their chairman and vice chairman. The next day we met with the trade rep, Liu He as you mentioned.</p><p>And so we basically listen on and so we basically sent one message and to oat We This president is very serious and he has bipartisan support in Congress said this president is very serious and has bipartisan support in congress to get a level playing field with China.</p><p>Look, the perspective here Maria is that we have a new free trade agreement with South Korea under President Trump. We have Japan now with an agreement in principle. We have a USMCA that if we put it all the floor of the before the House and the Senate today, It would pass in my Opinion.</p><p>Then we have Europe in here. So china is really moving I think to develop a more level playing field. But it's the series conversation. And it's to be ongoing for a while, I'm afraid.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Senator -- it's Dagen McDowell. How long is a while? because there's an election coming up. Not today, in North Carolina, but I'm talking about next year.</p><p>PERDUE: Well, obviously the big picture here is that we've got to get the president into a second term to deal with what you talked about just a minute ago and that's this debt crisis that we have and we have to deal with the entitlement programs and mandatory expenses to do that.</p><p>But I think right now what we see is an effort to get China to the table again and they're coming back in a few weeks as you mentioned. I'm hopeful that we'll see some progress.</p><p>Look, we have already made a lot of progress with China in terms of equal access. What we have is some difficulties with regard to intellectual property rights, the forced transfer of technology, the cyber war, and the compliance with the WTO.</p><p>I mean these are reasonable requests that President Trump is doing. And you know guys, isn't it high time that some United States president stood up to China and said look, we need equal access here and a level playing field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jack?</p><p>HOUGH: Senator, if you had to guess -- I was one of these people who thought for sure we're going to have a resolution before the 2020 election because the President isn't going to want to go into a campaign with this hanging over.</p><p>But now it doesn't look like that. If you had to guess, would you say before our after. I mean are we talking years that this could drag on?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, I 'll let some clear politicians make a prognostification (ph) about that. But I'll tell you this, from a business perspective, this is a deal that can be done. You've got two sides that are not exactly on the same page yet.</p><p>And look, you've got to respect the Chinese. They're the largest developing economy in the world. They see us as the largest developed economy in the world. I worry though about long-term intentions that China has disclosed over the last few years. So there's a real strong difficulties here.</p><p>I believe that we could get an agreement in part before next year. Look, our negotiators are finely in tune to this. I think Secretary Mnuchin and Ambassador Lighthizer are joined at the hip in terms of this negotiation. You've said that the Chinese are coming back here in a few weeks.</p><p>So I'm still hopeful by the end of this year we could see some noticeable progress that we could disclose publicly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I mean there's China and then there's USMCA. And, you know, we know that USMCA and the trade with China and -- I'm sorry, the trade with Mexico and Canada is more than a trillion dollars -- $1.1 trillion. China the trading is $500 billion.</p><p>So Congress is back in session with a big to do list. Obviously it feels like the Mexico, Canada situation is even more urgent than the China story. Eleven trade groups including the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Internet Association are urging lawmakers to pass President Trump's deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>It's a top priority for Republicans this fall. It's stalling in the House. Democrats are delaying the vote. What are you going to do?</p><p>PERDUE: Maria, you've got it. This is nothing but pure politics. This is a deal that got everything the democrats have wanted for the last decade -- stronger labor requirements, stronger compensation requirements in Mexico.</p><p>Mexico's already ratified it. Canada's in the process of doing it right now. I believe personally if we put it on the floor of the House and the Senate it would pass today. Americans want this. $68 billion increase in our GDP, 176,000 potential new jobs -- this is a good deal.</p><p>It's much better than NAFTA that we're under today. I can't see anything but pure politics is keeping this from being passed today.</p><p>LOWE: Senator, I just have one question. You know, you talk about this president needing to be reelected. Right now, we know that the trade war is obviously hitting China much more than it's hitting average Americans. For the average American it's going to cost them about $400 this year. But what if that does uptick before 2020? What then?</p><p>PERDUE: You know, in my state, soybean farmers have been hurt really bad by this tariffs. And they're the strongest supporters of this strategy and here's why. Because everybody sees the long-term reality of a level playing field. If we get a level playing field our exports go up dramatically.</p><p>And you know, guys, if you want to continue to grow this economy north of 3 percent, which we have to do to deal with the debt, you've got to grow exports. And that's what this president's trying to do.</p><p>Look, we had unlevel playing fields on most of our trade agreements for the last 50 years. Actually, since World War II, because we were trying to help the third world develop.</p><p>I lived in Asia. Senator Danes lived in Asia. That's one reason why we're trying to play a small part in helping this dimensional relationship with China. But this is a long-standing issue of our own making.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Senator -- really quickly, do the farmers need and will they get another bailout from the federal government? I think there have been two, north of $25 billion total, if my math is right. Do you think that more money is headed their way?</p><p>PERDUE: Well, we'll see. I mean, the best thing that could happen to farmers is the commodity prices would rebound. I mean we've got the lowest commodity prices in years and that's really devastating right now not only in the southeast but the Midwest as well as well as California. So we'll see.</p><p>I think the President has moved judiciously so far and he stands ready to back our farmers. We know this is a strategic industry. It's over half the GDP in home state of Georgia. So the President's got his eye on that for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Senator -- it's good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>PERDUE: Thanks, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: David Perdue joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, snuffing out e-cigarettes, the FDA issues a warning as one governor considers drastic measures. His agenda coming up on, as you see, vaping devices.</p><p>Then watch out McDonald's and Burger King, Wendy's ready to put breakfast on the table, the menu update after this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>E-cigarette maker Juul facing more backlash this morning through the Fed. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: That's right -- Maria. THE Food and Drug administration has put jewel on line notice are claiming that the company has ignored the law, marketing its product as safer than cigarettes. Now, the FDA also says the company targeted children. The company could face fines or other consequences.</p><p>Also, New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo says that he wants to ban flavored e- cigarettes in the state. New York would become then the second state to issue that ban, following Michigan, which did so just last week. And a former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has joined forces with the non- profit. Campaign for tobacco-free kids, putting $160 million into a program seeking to end e-cigarette use among young people.</p><p>Well, PG&amp;E offering a plan to settle with wildfire victims. It puts $18 billion on the table right now. The proposal put $80 billion dollars on the table right now. PG&amp;E filed for chapter 11 back in January due to liabilities stemming from California wildfires in 2017 and 2018, including November's camp fire, that was the deadliest and most destructive in state history.</p><p>Shares of PG&amp;E down more than 50 percent so far this year. Been a heck of a year for that company.</p><p>And then Amazon hosting a huge hiring event next week. They're going to be looking to fill 30,000 full and part-time jobs during the career day in six cities. This is going to be September 17th.</p><p>Amazon hosting job fares in Arlington, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Nashville and Seattle. Shares of Amazon, as you can see, in the premarket slightly down, Maria, just about a fraction right now.</p><p>And then finally, it is morning, it is breakfast time. How about waking up with Wendy's. The chain's bringing back their breakfast menu. They're going to spend $20 million to add more items to the menu and extend hours at their restaurants.</p><p>Some of the new items include a bacon breakfast sandwich, a chicken biscuit and this one, a frosty shake made with coffee. So you get sugar and caffeine all together. Right now, Wendy's offers breakfast at 300 locations. This we should say They cut their full year earnings forecast. That's actually been weighing on the stock, it's actually down almost 9 percent right now.</p><p>But maybe bringing the frosty with chocolate included is going to be the ticket. I'll let you know because I'm so going to go get one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- good idea, talk about breakfast when you just cut your guidance and stock is down 9 percent. That's a good strategy for Wendy's. But I do like the breakfast idea.</p><p>HOUGH: Take it from a fat guy, if you're starting your guy with a milkshake, you're not trying hard enough. You can make a better effort than that. You know what I mean.</p><p>Even I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But what do you think the frappuccino is? It might not be a milkshake but it's got the calories of a milkshake. People are walking around with the vinti coffee frappuccinos in the morning for breakfast.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>LOWE: It's fantastic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Does a body good --</p><p>LOWE: -- even though in chain restaurants dining is going down. It's now the fast food work are all the rage. We saw it with chicken sandwiches and now you get to see it with the breakfast wars.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But what's happening with the cutting of the guidance? The stock is down 9 percent right now. I mean is that an indication of the consumer or is that a Wendy's problem?</p><p>HOUGH: I think it's gotten very competitive there. I mean look at -- who do you have to know in this town to get a chicken sandwich at Popeye's, by the way. So I think it's a tough environment out there for Wendy's.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Quick break and then central bank in focus, futures are down this morning as investors await key decisions from the federal reserve and the European central bank. ECB coming out with news on Thursday. Market impact right after this.</p><p>And then Monday night thriller, highlights from the Saints-Texans game, the last secretary heroics, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Markets this morning are lower. We are awaiting key decisions from central banks, this week and next week.</p><p>The federal reserve will meet on September 18th. The European Central bank is coming out with me this Thursday. Investors are waiting to see if a rate cut will happen.</p><p>Joining us right now is U.S. Bank's Wealth Management, CIO, Eric Freedman. And Eric -- it's good to have you this morning. thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC FREEDMAN, U.S. BANKS'S WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Maria -- great to see you, as always.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First -- what are you expecting on Thursday from the ECB and let's talk the fed, because it's not just the fed, we've got, what, four central banks making decisions this month.</p><p>FREEDMAN: There's a lot, absolutely. This week we think the ECB has to commit -- in with the big number -- Maria. They've really been probably boxed into a corner by markets.</p><p>Looking around them, they see a lot of central banks, you know, north of 15, 16, who have then policy action the last couple of weeks.</p><p>And so the ECB because they have more of a stagnant meeting schedule is a little behind the curve if you will so we think they'll be pretty aggressive with a package that likely will, you know, will catch some waves with investors.</p><p>Then with the fed, we think the fed is likely to be more pragmatic, probably 25 basis points and really all eyes will be on the messaging afterwards.</p><p>So we do think the fed even though they said it's more of a mid-cycle pause, if you will, or more of a mid-cycle adjustment, I should say. We do think that markets are probably driving more of the Fed's behavior than they're willing to admit.</p><p>So those are the two things that we're looking for the next couple of weeks.</p><p>HOUGH: Eric -- what are the chances that we see negative yields at some point -- negative yielding 10-year treasury let's say here in the U.S. Obviously not right away</p><p>Aren't we headed down that path where these negative yields all around the world pull our yields down that low to prevent capital from pouring in and strengthening the dollar too much?</p><p>FREEDMAN: It's really important point of focus for us. We don't think that negative interest rates in the U.S. are likely. In fact, one of the comments that you appropriately made in the last segment was about what we're seeing with debt to GDP ratio.</p><p>So we do think that while there is a natural gravitational pull of the rest of the world interest rates pulling the 10-year treasury lower, we do look at the math in terms of the deficit out the next five, 10, 15 years. And that's probably more of a tug northward.</p><p>So we think that 1 percent would be the line in the sand, if you will, for now. You know, we're at 1.6 percent right now. There's a lot of room to go. If we were to see negative rates. But we would have to see we think more of a push toward 1, on decent volume which, again, for us is a low probability event. So we don't see negative rates anytime soon. Again, mostly because of the concerns about longer term deficits in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. And in terms of allocating capital what does that mean to you? Do you want to buy stocks here.</p><p>FREEDOMAN: We do -- Maria. We'd be buyers on a weakness, whether you think we're in those air pocketed news right across the global landscape or out of corporate earnings. And so most of the things you'll hear, like you're hearing this morning are pre-announcements from a negative side.</p><p>So we do think that expecting some lighter macroeconomic data that we would be buyers on a weakness here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Eric -- thanks so much.</p><p>FREEDMAN: Thanks so much -- Maria. Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Eric Freedman joining us, U.S. Bank.</p><p>Coming up, all eyes on Apple this morning. The technology giant unveils new products today including the iPhone 11. We're going to take you live to Apple Park, and get all the news this morning.</p><p>Then from down and out to an American success, one entrepreneur turning his love of fried chicken into a thriving business. His story, made in America, coming up.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, September 10th. Your top stories right now, 7:30 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p>It is Apple's big day today. The technology giant set to announce new iPhones. We're going to take you live to Apple Park, get a look at what to expect from Apple this morning.</p><p>Markets are lower, take a look at Futures, indicating a decline at the start of trading. Although the Dow Industrials has come all the way back, it is now exactly where it closed yesterday at 26,837. It's just fractionally moving.</p><p>So we're seeing a major comeback this morning with the markets coming back from the lows after modest moves on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow was up for a fourth session in a row yesterday. While the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ edged lower. Dow Industrials up 35 -- 38 points rather, at the close.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly lower. Take a look at European indices this morning. While the FT-100 just slipped into positive territory, it's up five points. The CAC Quarante in Paris is down five and the DAX Index in Germany is up 39. So it's very much a mixed story in the Eurozone.</p><p>Asian markets this morning mostly higher. In China, the produce -- the producer price index was out for the month of August, it was down eight- tenths of a percent year over year, that's the worst contraction since August of 2016.</p><p>Meanwhile, the price of pork is soaring. It is up 47 percent year over year due to the swine fever outbreak in China.</p><p>Uber's road ahead, spending $200 million in Chicago, this as ride-share companies head toward a major speed bump in California.</p><p>And David Ortiz's big return making his public -- first public appearance since being shot, where else, Fenway Park. Big comeback for him.</p><p>Plus, an exciting Monday Night for football, a winning play with just seconds on the clock. Wait until you see this. All the highlights coming up on sports.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, Apple's big event today, the company is expected to announce three new iPhones.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CyberGuy, Kurt Knutsson, to talk more about Apple. Hi, Kurt.</p><p>KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBERGUY: Hi Maria, good morning to you. Yes, we're right here at Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. Behind me, thousands of people, mainly from the media, will pour in there to see a brand-new iPhone. Is this it? No, this is the newest phone to me which is about a year old.</p><p>But I asked myself, how would they improve this so it would actually get a consumer to buy a new phone at this point, especially with the price point leading up to near $1,000 and passing it even sometimes.</p><p>So what if you could put three cameras on the back, a wide-angle lens, a telephoto lens, and another lens, what would that mean? Well, it could open up a door into augmented reality where Apple makes so much bigger play in that direction. It could be 3D capabilities that go with the phone. All speculated rumors at this point. The names of the phone, three of them, iPhone 11, the -- oops, excuse me. And the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max expected later today.</p><p>There could -- there's a rumor that the entry-level iPhone may come in a variety of colors and in also how would I make this better? I have a scratch on here. Apparently, leading rumor is they have developed the glass on the iPhone to be much more scratch resistant as well as more water-resistant, even though this is waterproof to some degree.</p><p>Other improvements inside of this, faster processor, you've got the A13 and then a co-processor which could be the secret sauce here, code name Rose, it works together with the battery and processor allegedly to bring about super long battery life. We could be hearing about that later today as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Kurt, it's Dagen. I wanted to ask you about --</p><p>KNUTSSON: Hi, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- the X -- the 11, because I'm looking at the -- so the 11, the 11 Pro and then the 11 Pro Max, is there really a need to differentiate the phones and get a little bit more granular if you will?</p><p>KNUTSSON: You know, I think what you'll see in the Pro Max is the larger format phone and then you'll see the camera set that is going to be the big, big news here.</p><p>So Apple's got to do something to get us excited. The cameras are apparently it, along with what I would imagine would be a developer kit that goes along with creating augmented reality. So that it's easier for developers to make things that will get us really engage with the iPhone using those cameras.</p><p>Drop it down and notch and you're probably not going to see those cameras that's on there or will you. But that typically is where the money comes in in those advancements.</p><p>So you're going to pay more for the more space, the faster processor, the longer battery life, a larger phone and then the chassis on it is likely to be glass and who knows what on the -- on the lower end model.</p><p>JACK HOUGH, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, BARRON'S: Hi, Kurt, I want to run a theory by you. You tell me if I'm wrong. Most people get a new phone every -- they used to do it every two years, now they're pushing three years. Now people looking at this upgrade, they're going to say, all right, better camera but my camera's already pretty good. Better screen, but my screen is already pretty good.</p><p>The next thing I want to hold out for is whatever 5G is going to mean to the world and this phone won't have it. Therefore, I want to skip the upgrade and wait for the 5G phone a year or so from now. You think that the -- what do you think about theory?</p><p>KNUTSSON: That could spell big trouble for Apple. I think you're on to something. So, how profound will that camera set be, how profound will the duration of battery life be? If they really nail it and if you can make a phone where I can just throw it around and it doesn't scratch or smash, maybe that compels me to get into this generation.</p><p>But you're right, 5G is not in this chipset but it will be in future phones. You can count on it. Apple's made sure of that. But they're a little late to this game.</p><p>But keep in mind also, we're fooled into thinking that 5G is everywhere in America. It's not. It's in the very minute pockets still at this point. So that robust next-generation wireless that we're hoping for is still yet on the infrastructure side, a little bit ways out where you can rely on it just about everywhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't even have cell service between my parents' house and Richmond, Virginia. And that's a two-hour drive. And there's zero cell service.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Have I suggested a C.B. radio to you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) As if I don't have one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was -- I was going to say that. You know, there aren't any 5G phones on the market by the way and I -- and I am being told that the first real 5G situation that we're going to see is enterprise. It's not going to be a consumer product right away. It will be more enterprise buying into 5G, so we'll see. But I mean, AT&amp;T says it's calling it evolving, you know, it's advertised its marketing, it's all evolving, you know, 5G.</p><p>KNUTSSON: It's a marketing spin, it's such a spin.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's just marketing, there's no 5G phones on the market.</p><p>I've got to ask about the anti-trust probe into some of these companies. The company Google facing an investigation from 50 attorneys general of a potential monopolistic behavior. California and Alabama are now involved, the districts of Colombia and Puerto Rico are.</p><p>And the key issue that people are talking about is whether Google abuses its market dominance in online searches and advertising.</p><p>And Kurt, didn't we see that in the 2016 election where when you Googled, you know, Hillary Clinton, you've got all these great, great stories about her that she was the best thing since sliced bread when you -- when you Googled Donald Trump, you got he was the most horrible person in the world. I mean, the way that they put their searches when you search for something is being looked at.</p><p>KNUTSSON: As well as how they finish the search, if you notice, when they begin to type how it will suggest a search for you that can lead you to a negative path and an outcome or pro or positive path.</p><p>And when you see these 50 U.S. states led by Ken Paxton, the attorney general for the state of Texas, he'll be leading this charge. This is an enormous concern for Google and for all tech companies here in Silicon Valley, to see all this unified action from states against Silicon Valley and the idea of the monopolies, I think there's a thought now that Silicon Valley has just gotten a little bit too big for their britches and there's not a lot of room for mom and pops or anybody else to innovate and enter in to the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, we'll be watching that. Good to see you, Kurt. Thank you so much.</p><p>KNUTSSON: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kurt Knutsson there at the Apple event. We're going to be waiting on what Apple comes out with.</p><p>Coming up, I'll be talking with the Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge about the anti-trust investigation. So stay with us on this Google story and the investigations into anti-trust behavior.</p><p>Meanwhile, Uber announcing its latest investment in Chicago along with plans to hire 2,000 new employees over the next three years. It's not all good news today for the ride-sharing giant though. Grady Trimble is live in Chicago with the latest there. Grady, good morning to you.</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria. I'll start with the good news, the Chicago office will become Uber's second largest in the country, behind only its headquarters in San Francisco.</p><p>Uber already has 1,300 employees here in Chicago and most of them work in freight. Now the company is adding 2,000 more jobs here over the next three years. They'll be focused also on Uber Freight which links shippers with trucking firms.</p><p>In a statement, Uber's CEO says it plans to invest $200 million a year here, adding, Chicago is the heart of America's transportation and logistics industry and there's no better place to continue to grow our teams and open our dedicated freight H.Q.</p><p>Separately, the bump in the road for Uber, Lyft and other companies that rely on independent contractors, they could take a huge hit this week. California lawmakers are expected to pass a landmark bill that would classify rideshare drivers among other independent contractors as employees. That would mean they'd be entitled to benefits and a minimum hourly wage. Democrats including some of the presidential candidates support this move, saying it protects workers. Many drivers are rallying behind it too. But the rideshare companies say that this could cost them big money, up to 20 to 30 percent increase in their costs.</p><p>California's governor, he's already said he plans to sign this if it passes, which looks increasingly likely. And there's a wide-ranging impacts for this because other states will likely follow suit if California passes this bill.</p><p>Uber and Lyft stock as you see have slumped in recent weeks, partly on news of this. And as you see, ridesharing companies are diversifying, going into other industries like freight. Part of the reason for that is government regulation, as well as the fact that they are still not profitable. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Grady. Grady Trimble for us.</p><p>Coming up, an emotional night in Boston, David Ortiz throwing out the first pitch at Fenway, his first public appearance since being shot. Big Papi's heartfelt return.</p><p>Plus, made in America, our next guest turned his love of chicken into a deep-fried success story. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. It is called New York City's only all American food truck. That is Yankee Doodle Dandy's, becoming one of the most popular food trucks in Manhattan, due to the patriotic theme and delicious food.</p><p>Joining me right now is the founder and CEO of Yankee Doodle Dandy, here's Josh Gatewood. Josh, great to have you. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>JOSH GATEWOOD, FOUNDER AND CEO, YANKEE DOODLE DANDY'S: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, here we are in the rain. This truck is gorgeous and I see you a lot. Well, (INAUDIBLE) when you have rain like this, does that cut into business?</p><p>GATEWOOD: The rain kills the food truck, yes. So you're capturing what's wrong with the food truck business actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, God. But you have an incredible story, tell us your story.</p><p>GATEWOOD: So, yes. So I've set out on this journey and I was short on capital. I was working at a boiler room on 14 Wall Street right across the street from the New York Stock Exchange and I was broke. But I was studying for my series 763 and was short on capital. But when I was in the -- in the room studying for my series 763 I was like what can I do other than this? Because you know, it's -- the boiler room thing is done now.</p><p>So I came up with the idea of Yankee Doodle Dandy's. My directress ancestor was in the revolutionary war. So Yankee Doodle Dandy's was like - - Yankee Doodle Dandy's was our first national anthem. So I wanted to capture like all American food, culture, and that's what I did, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wait a second. Go back for a second because you actually -- you won money on \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\"</p><p>GATEWOOD: Right. So I was -- so yes, I was short on capital and my solution to my capital shortage was applying for \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" what any rational person would do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is amazing.</p><p>GATEWOOD: And I kept trying, I didn't get on. I kept trying, I didn't get on. And I would sit there on the 7 train going back to Queens, and like, men, I just want anything to change my life.</p><p>So I went back to Knoxville, Tennessee where I went to college and I moved in with my little sister. And I was sitting on an air mattress in her house, and I got the call, right after I left New York. They're like Josh, you're on the show on Thursday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, that's amazing.</p><p>GATEWOOD: And I was like, no way. I started tearing up. I couldn't believe it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you go on \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" How much did you win?</p><p>GATEWOOD: So I got on the show and I was super nervous when I started but it went pretty well. And I got to the $100,000 question and so I had about $40,000 in my like, savings account or whatever and I went for it and I actually flipped the can of chewing tobacco to see if I can win a $100,000. I said if I could win, I'm going to (INAUDIBLE) in the gas. I guess I got it wrong because I got $25,000.</p><p>But on the show, I said I was going to start restaurants in New York City. And so it's been my dream and I've been working toward that tirelessly. I didn't win enough for a restaurant. I got a food truck.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so you had the $25,000 to start the food truck. What were the big costs involved in starting up this food truck? I love the food truck business. I think it's just the most entrepreneurial business and it's just so interesting that it's thriving in America.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Absolutely, it's near and dear to me because you know, it's been -- it was a second opportunity for me, a fresh start. And so there's a lot of turnover in this business because the city makes it very difficult to be successful. We get bopped with parking tickets every day, twice a day. My truck on 46th street is fined with $115 ticket right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're constantly getting parking tickets.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Constantly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why you can't find the spot to bear you just don't --</p><p>GATEWOOD: No, just -- so the city made it illegal to sell for metered parking. And so you get hit with $65.00 every day. And yes, so they add up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. All right, so what were the big costs away from the parking tickets?</p><p>GATEWOOD: Just buying the truck, really.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Buying the truck, that was the big cost.</p><p>GATEWOOD: But there's a lot of turnovers, you can buy a used truck. I built trucks, you know, there's a lot of different ways to get started so - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, what a long way from the boiler room.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Working in a boiler room. OK, so tell me about the menu, how you came up with the ideas, how the food is.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, it's not just that you had to raise money to get the truck to start a business. Then you've got to deliver and then you've got to actually execute.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Right, so when I went to college down south, being a northern -- I grew up in the north and I saw these chicken places down there and they were absolutely killing it and I had no idea why or how. So that's what kind of where the idea came from.</p><p>So I actually went down there, learned how to cook and then came back up, bought the truck, put it in a food truck and it's -- and it's been going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Chicken tenders have a broad appeal. Everyone likes them. And yes, so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you always been a cook?</p><p>GATEWOOD: No, I've just always been a business-minded person.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you're cooking now.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Yes, and I love it. I mean, honestly, I love what I do. It's just I wish it was a little bit less stressful but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the -- what's the big stress involved?</p><p>GATEWOOD: What isn't stress, managing people, finding good workers, the parking situation. I've been in fistfights for parking in New York City.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me about the growth story then. How many people work for you, how many trucks do you hope to get?</p><p>GATEWOOD: Well so, I basically have three trucks right now and I'm tapping out of trucks. I actually was -- so like I said, it was my dream to get a restaurant. I was actually just given my first lease for a restaurant so the dream is coming true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Yes, so I've got a restaurant location picked out. and yes, I made it happen. But America, I'm hoping for investment, if you want to make some money, some all American food, promote American food, I'm your guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. I mean, you are the quaint essential American dream story.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you living your American dream?</p><p>GATEWOOD: Absolutely. And I got people with me, you know, I live with a couple from Morocco who came here, my buddy just got citizenship. He's worked with me. He's stuck -- when we first started I wasn't making any money. He didn't even take pay. Because he saw our food, saw how good it was, and he stuck with me.</p><p>And honestly, a lot of people would have thrown in the -- thrown in the towel. But the secret to life, truthfully, is just not giving up. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I'll out-work anyone. If you just believe in it and go after it and don't stop, you'll get what you want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally agree, the hard work is the secret to everything.</p><p>GATEWOOD: It's the secret, honestly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People just underestimate the power of hard work.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so the food truck industry is just soaring right now. Any thoughts on that in terms of, you know, getting a foothold in an area or an industry that's growing so much and you've got a ton of food trucks just on this street.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Yes, definitely. So I'm actually the president of the New York City Food Truck Association as well and I help people constantly. So people call me and say how do I start a food truck and I'm more than willing to just help them out. Because when I was going through it, nobody helped me.</p><p>So it's nice to have someone they can ask questions, they bounce questions off me. You know, I don't know everything but I learned a lot of things and I'm still learning every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secret to the best chicken tenders?</p><p>GATEWOOD: The marinade, getting good quality chicken, keeping it fresh, it's fresh, never frozen, antibiotic hormone-free. Hand breading it on the truck, keeping it crispy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go. Josh, I can see why you're successful.</p><p>GATEWOOD: I try really hard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Keep on rocking. Thank you so much.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you.</p><p>GATEWOOD: Thank you, ma'am.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Josh Gatewood there. A Yankee Doodle Dandy. Great story there.</p><p>We're going to take a short break. When we come back, Monday Night thriller, highlights from the dramatic Saints-Texans matchup last night. All the heroics when we come right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big Papi back, Boston. Jared Max, what a scene at Fenway last night.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: That was so cool, Dagen. Red Sox fans probably thought they were just got to get to see their team get eliminated from the division race. But instead one of their all-time favorites made a surprise visit, David Big Papi Ortiz, first public appearance since he was seriously injured in a shooting back in June.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Red Sox Hall of Famer, number 34, David Ortiz.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: David Ortiz throwing out the first pitch to his old mate Jason Varitek. Monday Night football, doubleheader, Saints and Texans in New Orleans. After Houston scored a go-ahead touchdown with 37 seconds left. The Saints marched down the field for kicker Wil Lutz to try to make the longest field goal of his career.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 58-yard attempt for the win. Got it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: And even with botched calls by the refs in New Orleans, the Saints still survived, 30-28.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Oakland, the Raiders moved swiftly carrying less baggage without Antonio Brown on-board. No problem, early touchdown, Tyrell Williams catches one from David Carr. Oakland beat Denver, 24-16.</p><p>Did you notice the graphic during the Monday Night game early on? You see in the corner there where it says third and 15. The yellow color messed with football fans' minds. We're used to thinking that's a penalty.</p><p>Well, ESPN made a change because in the second half as Adam Schefter of the ESPN noted a change was made because the new graphic was lifted. ESPN heard the feedback and they say acted quickly.</p><p>A lot of times Twitter might just be a place for the gallery to be barking at the moon. This time, they barked and they heard and a change was made. So how about that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Makes sense. Totally.</p><p>MAX: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jared Max. And I know Donna Brazile is very happy about her Saints winning because she was tweeting about it last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is that right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes she was.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jared, we'll catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Sirius XM 115. Jared, thank you.</p><p>A quick break and then Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on the Google anti-trust investigation, next hour, right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, September 23rd. Your top stories, right now, 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are off of the lows this morning, take a look at markets, Dow Industrials down 33 points, the S&amp;P down three quarters of one point and the NASDAQ is up 7-1/2, pretty much keeping where we were over the last hour or so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, the market posted the losing week, but all these three major indices are just within striking distance of hitting all-time highs, even though last week, the Dow was down better than one percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets this morning, look like this, European indices are lower. We had signs of a slowdown in the European economy, once again, manufacturing sentiment in the Eurozone down in September, to the worst level nearly seven years.</p><p>The Purchasing Managers' Indexes were out this morning in Germany and France. They, too, came in below analysts' expectations. The FT 100 is down 31, the CAC Quarante is down 61, the DAX Index in Germany is lower by 138.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished mixed, as you see, Japan was closed for a national holiday, worst performer was China. Shanghai composite down about one percent.</p><p>Investigating Facebook, Dow Jones is reporting that Snap, Snap kept a dossier called Project Voldemort on the ways that Facebook allegedly tried to thwart competition. Now, Snap is talking to the government about it.</p><p>The General Motors strike is entering day eight. Report say that important progress has been made, but we could still be far from seeing workers back on the assembly line. We're going to take you live to Detroit, coming up. Plus, living rent-free, how's that? A look at why millennials think their parents should let them live at home for nothing, for as long as they need to.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning, and joining me to break it all down, Payne Capital Management president, Ryan Payne is here, FOX News contributor and Columnist for The Hill, Liz Peek, and the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman. Great to see everybody today.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here. Enjoyed your Giuliani interview. I think he's got a dossier on Hunter Biden, and this is going to be a tough story for Joe Biden to explain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I thought it was interesting that he said, look, unless this happened, the Democrats and the -- and the media were not going to focus on what Hunter Biden's doing, and now they have to focus on what he has done.</p><p>PEEK: I think he's totally right. The story has been out there. It's not a secret that Joe -- but no one's ever paid any attention to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>PEEK: Let's not forget, as U.N. week, President Trump's coming to the U.N., always shakes things up a little bit, that's my focus this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm looking forward.</p><p>PEEK: Me too.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: And let's not forget about the trade deal, can't forget that's still happening, they're still trying to negotiate, if that happens, just going to be being fantastic.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Liu He -- they're looking on October 10th, early October for these major talks that are going to happen after the minister's meetings last week. We'll see about that. There were some signs of maybe the two sides getting together, but we'll see. These are big ticket items like intellectual property theft. We're going to talk about all of the above, coming up.</p><p>Our top story this hour, questions swirling around President Trump's July phone call with the president of the Ukraine. This, as the president has a packed schedule at the U.N. general assembly. Blake Burman is at the White House this morning, with more. Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you, as well. Three full days of meetings ahead for President Trump in New York City as he heads to the United Nations for the general assembly there.</p><p>And no doubt about it, hovering over all of this, especially leading into it, is the story involving the conversation that President Trump had with the newly elected leader of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, earlier this summer. The president acknowledging over the weekend that when the two spoke, they talked about Joe Biden.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We has a great conversation. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place. It was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now, Democrats say that amounts to asking a foreign power to dig up potential dirt on a domestic political opponent. In a statement, Nancy Pelosi is urging the director of national intelligence to provide the whistleblower complaint regarding the call to Congress.</p><p>Writing to her colleagues over the weekend, \"If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy.\"</p><p>But the president's personal attorney this morning, Rudy Giuliani, is accusing the former vice president of helping get rid of a corruption prosecutor that was zeroing in on a Ukrainian company with ties to Biden's son, Hunter. Giuliani also argues that President Trump did nothing wrong on that phone call with Zelensky.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PERSONAL ATTORNEY OF DONALD TRUMP: Now, there is no quid pro quo, no money -- proper action by a president, they might say improper. But, certainly, not grounds for impeachment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: At the U.N. for the president later today, six meetings, including with the leaders of Pakistan, Egypt and South Korea. On a schedule tomorrow, the heads of the U.K., India and Iraq, and Maria, on Wednesday, President Trump will also have a bilateral meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Well, that's going to be something to watch. We'll be talking about that for sure, Blake, thanks so much. Blake Burman at the White House.</p><p>And joining me right now for reaction is the White House press secretary, director of communications for President Trump, as well as First Lady Melania Trump, Stephanie Grisham.</p><p>Stephanie, it's great to see you.</p><p>STEPHANIE GRISHAM, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE FIRST LADY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is one of the first times you're coming out and having the world see who's behind all of this.</p><p>GRISHAM: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've been in this new roll since June, where you're helping not just the first lady, but also President Trump.</p><p>GRISHAM: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How are you dealing with all these -- these are three different jobs.</p><p>GRISHAM: Well, women can do it all, so there's that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>I always say, you want to get something done, give it to a busy woman.</p><p>GRISHAM: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She'll throw another ball in the air.</p><p>GRISHAM: Exactly. A lot of multitasking and I have a really, really good team, too, so -- on both sides of the House, East and West Wing both. So they are very supportive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have been able to really get to know our first lady, Mrs. Trump. Tell us about her because you don't see her around anywhere, you don't see her in fashion magazines, even though she looks absolutely gorgeous, and she's all the time or even talking about her Be Best campaign. Tell us about Mrs. Trump.</p><p>GRISHAM: She is wonderful. And this country is very, very lucky to have her as the first lady.</p><p>She -- it's funny you talk about the magazines. That's not something that she seeks. She wants to go in, get her work done, work on behalf of this country, and she doesn't need the credit for it. She's fantastic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's -- she's going to be involved in the U.N. meetings, as well as going down to Wall Street.</p><p>GRISHAM: So today she's going to go to the New York Stock Exchange with a local school, with some children. The kids are going to get a tour and kind of learn about this great economy under President Trump, and then they're going to ring the bell, which is obviously an iconic thing to do here in New York City. So that will be really fun. It's part of her Be Best initiative.</p><p>Then she'll attend the speech tomorrow with the president, of course, and then they've got a diplomatic reception.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about to Be Best initiative, because I see her with children all the time and she goes and she spends time at these schools. What are the -- what is she trying to do? Tell us her priorities in Be Best.</p><p>GRISHAM: Absolutely. So she's got three pillars. She knows that -- I mean and it's -- in 2019 there's no one issue that kids are facing. So opioid abuse is obviously a big deal for her. And then social media online safety is very important. And then just overall well-being. So any kind of healthy living, teaching children to make, you know, good choices, including vaping. She just came out talking about how that shouldn't be marketed to children.</p><p>So children are the priority and then just the many -- the many issues that they're facing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I feel like that was a big priority for her, and she basically educated the president on it when it comes to vaping.</p><p>GRISHAM: Absolutely. She -- she had a very big role in that. Obviously, she's a parent herself. And it's just very, very important to her that kids understand the dangers of the addictive nature of e-cigs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we saw what Sarah Sanders, the pressure that she was under. She would take the podium and just sort of try to, you know, take shots from everybody. Are you feeling that you're getting that same pushback from the media against this president? What -- tell me what you're feeling so far.</p><p>GRISHAM: Well -- well, I think, just to be honest with you, it's disappointing the way the media has been -- is and has become and the way they treat this president and this first lady.</p><p>In terms of the briefings, I don't feel a pressure to be there. The president is his own best spokesperson. He goes out. He's the most accessible president in history. The briefings, to me, became a lot of theater, and it became a way for a certain reporter to just get more face time or book deals or contributor contracts. And I don't feel the need to help them do that.</p><p>My job is to talk about what he's doing and communicate his policies and I can do that in an array of ways, what that's what we're doing and it's just working out fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about the president's priorities. I mean, obviously, the president is on the world stage this week. He's giving a religious freedom speech at the United Nations today, ahead of the speech to the General Assembly tomorrow.</p><p>What are the president's goals this week, and what's most important to the president in terms of his policy priorities?</p><p>GRISHAM: Well, I think for this week at UNGA, diplomacy is important. He's going to be speaking with world leaders, allies, and not so friendly world leaders. And so he -- he's going to want to talk to him about our priorities and what we're doing and the ways that we can best work together, but always with America first at the forefront.</p><p>The speech tomorrow is going to be really great. It's going to be talking about his -- his priorities and his policies and the things he's been doing for the United States and how he wants to continue to work with our allies to further the American people's agenda.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He talks a lot about the economic agenda and certainly moving the needle on economic growth, and yet his moves on foreign policy are also quite significant. In terms of his priorities, where do you see the ramp-up going into 2020?</p><p>GRISHAM: Well, I'll tell you, since taking the job I've been really fortunate to sit in on a lot of these meetings. And just at the G-7 in France, he and Japan forged a deal in principle that looks like we'll be -- we'll be signing something in the next couple of days and -- over agriculture and produce. So the president works so well with all of these foreign leaders, our allies certainly. But I think the thing that has struck me is, when he works with leaders such as Kim Jong-un, or Putin that he gets, you know, maybe criticized for being too friendly.</p><p>I've seen him behind closed doors and all the president cares about is this country and he works very, very hard for this country with -- with those foreign leaders.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, he's changed the conversation on China.</p><p>GRISHAM: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's for sure.</p><p>GRISHAM: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's the tensions with Iran, which people want to know, where is this going? The Iranian president, Rouhani, is now slamming latest round of U.S. sanctions on the rogue regime. He says it's desperate. This morning Iran also freed a British tanker it seized back in July, ending a month long standoff with the U.K. ahead of the U.N. summit.</p><p>In terms of Iran, do you feel like the president -- you know, going to the U.N., having to see the Iranian president and then, you know, North Korea, I mean how is he feeling going into all of these meetings where they're all going to be right there and he's going to be front and center at that podium.</p><p>GRISHAM: He's fearless. He is focused on our country. He will work with anybody. He knows that he's got an obligation to try to work with anybody. But he's fearless and he puts this country first that that's all that matters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Now, the first lady, she has been right there, his partner, throughout this, even though he's had so many skeptics in the press. Does that -- is that a big issue for her? What does she say about all of this?</p><p>GRISHAM: You know, I've learned so much from her. She -- she's -- she's his rock. She really is a rock. And -- and for the whole family. And none of it bothers her. She always say to me, Stephanie, it's all just noise. And it really is. And I've learned a lot from her in that regard. She sees every day the media, she sees how dishonest they are. I mean when it comes to her, when it comes to him, when it comes to the family. So it doesn't bother her and she's very unwavering in that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's got to be tough.</p><p>How are you feeling going into 2020 when you've got all of these people onstage and the Democrats' side trying to take down this president going into 2020?</p><p>GRISHAM: Nobody's going to take down this president. He's going to win and that's just going to be how it is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stephanie, we'll be watching you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GRISHAM: Thank you very, very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Appreciate it. Stephanie Grisham here on set.</p><p>Coming up, the UAW strike against General Motors, entering week two, 49,000 G.M. workers protesting at 30 plants around the country. We're going to take you live to Detroit, get the very latest there.</p><p>And then, pay up millennials, arguing that they are entitled to free rent with mom and dad post-graduation, we're going to talk to current students and get their take on this heated debate. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The strike against General Motors now entering a second week. Grady Trimble is live in Detroit this morning with the very latest. Grady, g morning to you.</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. We're told some progress was made over the weekend, but it's unclear how much closer the two sides are to a deal. Meanwhile, this strike became markedly more political over the weekend. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the 2020 hopefuls who paid these workers a visit here at the Detroit Hamtramck assembly plant. One of the things we've been hearing from workers is how they want a bigger cut of G.M.'s profits. That's something that Senator touched on as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: G.M. makes billions of dollars in profits last year and closed five plants around this country. G.M. is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or to the people of America. Their only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving your job to Mexico, or to Asia, or anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRIMBLE: The Senator is correct in that. G.M. posted profits of almost $12 billion in 2018. She also brought up Mexico, and G.M. will point out that it has way more employees here in the United States than it does in Mexico. And it also invests a lot more money here. Meanwhile, while Senator Warren was here, Vice President or former Vice President Joe Biden, visited strikers in Kansas City. Here's some of what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Look what happened when we vote bailed out G.M. We didn't bail out G.M., UAW (INAUDIBLE) G.M. When I say that that's just not hyperbole, that's a fact. You gave up more than anybody. You gave up more than anybody. That's why G.M. made it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRIMBLE: We're told Senator Bernie Sanders will be here Wednesday of this week if the strike continues. It's clear these candidates are showing their support for the workers, but they also see the value in having the support of the workers come 2020. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hi, Grady. Thank you. We'll be watching. Grady Trimble in Detroit. Coming up, global growth fear, stocks slipping this morning on trade uncertainty disappointing manufacturing data out of Europe. As more Americans label the U.S. economy as poor and feel it's getting worse. We're going to take a look at that. Then big tech crackdown. Mark Zuckerberg faces tough scrutiny from lawmakers on internet regulation. I'll speak with Georgia Congressman Doug Collins who met with Facebook chiefs on Capitol Hill on Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures a little change this morning. We are expecting a decline at the start of trading for the Dow Industrials down 39 points. S&amp;P is down one point, and the NASDAQ is higher by three points that's off of the highs of the morning. This, as U.S.-China trade hangs in the balance and weaker-than-expected manufacturing data came out of Europe this morning. Joining us right now is Northern Trust Wealth Management CIO Katie Nixon. Katie, it's good to have you.</p><p>KATIE NIXON, CIO, NORTHERN TRUST WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me just point out that the China ministry finance -- the China Ministry of Commerce issued -- pardon me -- issued a statement calling last week's talks, constructive, whatever that means. You did have this week, Eurozone PMIs out this morning. And we are looking for the rest of today when we get the September flash PMIs At 9:45. We'll see what that means for manufacturing. Having said all of that, how do you invest in this environment?</p><p>NIXON: Lots of news to digest, clearly. The news on China, it's sort of more of the same. We've been here many, many times. We're not expecting there to be any meaningful resolution. Prior -- really probably prior to the 2020 election, we do think we might have interim deals, despite what President Trump said on Friday where he said we were only going to be a big-bang deal. I think both sides probably want to see some progress.</p><p>In terms of PMI data, I mean, Europe is week. We've been talking about that for a long time. It's not surprising, but it's deepening. And certainly, when you have the engine of growth in Europe, Germany facing such dire manufacturing numbers, clearly very influenced by the global sort of slow down and auto automobile manufacturing. That's not a good sign for Europe. And, you know what, Draghi seem to have gotten it right when he did his big bazooka couple of weeks ago and really pulled out all the stops in front of what is really proving to be a really weak scenario.</p><p>PEEK: But isn't it amazing that with the E.U. generally being so, as you say, Draghi being so openhanded and everything else, and yet Germany passes this green program, which is tens of billions of euros, and yet, they're going to raise taxes to pay for it. And I think everyone in the world except Germans are saying, are you kidding? Why would you not have at least some borrowing at negative interest rates to fund something like that, and make it a stimulative measure?</p><p>NIXON: You know what, Liz, it's real head scratcher, to be honest. Because when you think about the green -- the climate deal in Europe, 52 billion euro, the multiplier is not one for one in terms of stimulus, it's actually less than one because the deal is going to be relatively expensive. And it's probably going to increase energy costs. So, net-net, it doesn't look like a positive exactly at the time when the pressure is on for some sort of stimulus. The good news is that Merkel affirmed her belief in a balanced budget. So, they still do have some wiggle room because they have a surplus right now. But 2-1/2, 2.4 2.5 percent of GDP. So, there is some wiggle room there, and we think they're going to have to use it. Again, politicians don't act outside of crisis, Liz.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NIXON: We'll see. You know, Germany is in a technical recession. And I think that, you know, the politicians will have to act.</p><p>PAYNE: And kind of play off that, too. I mean, OK, we know it's slow. Like you said, that's not new news to anybody, but I always look at valuations. They're just so attractive in Europe right now. Dividend yields are really attractive versus where they're getting on negative- yielding debt. What's your view on Europe as an investment right now while the news is bad?</p><p>NIXON: So, we prefer us assets over European equities right now. And I'll tell you, one of the issues with looking at European valuations is they're very heavily influenced by financials.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>NIXON: And financials are just cheap. And they're cheap for a reason. And I think Draghi is trying to address the pain that he's inflicted on financials with negative interest rates through the tearing, that's going to take some time. But Europe is just overbanked, and you know, we're starting to see some of that rationalization take place, but it's going to take some time. Meanwhile, we see, as you said, U.S. is doing great. U.S. earnings are looking to be much more positive in 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting for the third-quarter earnings?</p><p>NIXON: You know, it's going to be rough, Maria, third-quarter is going to be flat, some would even suggest down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So things pick up in the fourth quarter?</p><p>NIXON: Things will pick up into in the fourth quarter, and then it's all relative, right? So, comparisons in 2020 will be my easier. I mean, it's really a technology and an energy story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because there's this new Gallup Poll, which is out this morning, reveals Americans are not so confident, 49 percent of Americans asked think a recession could be likely in the next year. It's just a speculation, or do you think that there actually are reasons to believe that the recession could happen in the next year?</p><p>NIXON: Well, let's break it down. So, you have sort of financial market indicators and economic indicators. So, economic indicators: services, very strong; consumption, very strong; unemployment, very low; momentum, slowing; jobs creation slowing, but still positive and strong. Financial Markets, you've got credit spreads that are tight, that's a positive. You don't typically see that in front of a recession. The one area that's flashing red would be the yield curve. You've got the three-month, 10-year still inverted, the tooth tends kind of skirting around flat to inverted, slightly -- I guess there's two-basis points positive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why? I mean, that doesn't always indicate a recession, right, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, the frequently signals -- what is it? -- it's like an economist predicted 10 out of the last three recessions and sometimes it can be a false signal. But I'm wondering, how do you price in the possibilities on politics, where we get a German-style environmental regulation, German -- European-style zero-growth economics. You've got Elizabeth Warren surging in the polls. You've got maybe Biden, and then you've got Trump. I mean, how do you price in -- do you think markets have priced in the possibilities here? How do you look at that?</p><p>NIXON: So, political uncertain -- geopolitical uncertainty is super high. In addition to the ones that you just reference, we have Brexit, we have tensions in the Gulf, the list goes on and on, frankly. So, there's no shortage of geopolitical risk. I mean, there's always geopolitical risk, there just seems to be a lot more right now coming from a lot of different places. And it probably isn't fully priced in into the market.</p><p>One of the things like trade risk, for example, it could have a really positive impact on the market. So, it's a really that cuts both ways. It could be a negative if we go to December and have the tariffs put into place, which would be very negative for the U.S. That's a wildcard. But it could be really positive. If we come to some sort of a resolution, you've got global growth that starts to come back. So, some of it isn't -- is not fully priced into the market at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, China canceled the planned visits to U.S. farms this week. Lot of people were wondering why that happened at the end of Friday. Bloomberg is reported that that was carried out at the behest of us. And now, people are changing their tune and say, Well, maybe this is a positive.</p><p>NIXON: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Actually. So, we'll see. It's all speculation until the deal gets done. I know that. Katie, it's great to see you.</p><p>NIXON: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much, Katie Nixon joining us there. Coming up, policing big tech, Georgia congressman Doug Collins is one of the lawmakers who met with Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week, as did of course, the president. He will join me here on set, next. And then, moving back home my costume millennials say they are entitled to free room and board after college. But parents think otherwise. The heated debate, coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, September 23rd. Your top stories right now 8:32 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets are right now indicating a decline at the start of trading. Dow Futures down 44 points; S&amp;P down two and the NASDAQ lower by one point. This is basically back at lows of the morning right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning are also lower. As you see, signs of slowing in the Eurozone among the reasons manufacturing sentiment in Europe zone fell in September to the worst level in nearly seven years. And then, there was the Purchasing Managers Indexes, this morning, out of Germany in France. They came in below expectations, showing weakness in manufacturing and that's unnerving stocks.</p><p>FT-100 down 21, CAC Quarante down 58, and the DAX Index in Germany is lower by 136 points. That was worse -- that was the worst of them all and it is down better than one percent. In Asia overnight, Japan is closed for a national holiday. The others were mixed. Shanghai Composite the worst performer down almost one percent in China.</p><p>The streaming wars deepen; Disney Plus is available for preorder ahead of its big November debut.</p><p>And big change at Overstock.

What do you think?</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning. But first, our top story this half an hour. President Trump's July phone call with president of Ukraine. The president reportedly pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his anti-trust investigations into Ukraine, while his son Hunter Biden was working there. Earlier in the program, I spoke with president's personal attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani about that call.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIULIANI: The Democrats, you know, wanted to impeach when it was quid pro quo and money, now there's no quid pro quo, no money -- proper action by a president, they might say improper, but certainly not grounds for impeachment. As the story gets less serious, as the story disappears, they still want to impeach. So, I hope the American people get the point. They want to impeach, doesn't matter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Now, we know that.</p><p>GIULIANI: Here is the problem for them: even if you take the first story, about the president, but Biden did as much worse.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Georgia Congressman, House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins. And Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for your time this morning.</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): Thanks Maria, it's good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, let me ask you about this Ukraine call, I mean, Rudy Giuliani was just on with me, he said a lot of things there, particularly about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. Is this phone call between the president and the president of Ukraine going to be a problem for President Trump?</p><p>COLLINS: I think right now it's just another issue that the Democrats have latched onto, and it's amazing to me, Maria, and I was listening to part of that interview that you had with me with Mr. Giuliani, it's amazing to me the different standards the Democrats are now using.</p><p>Any time something comes up that they don't like with the president, they're saying, well, you need to prove that you didn't do anything wrong. When did that become the standard?</p><p>It's become the standard for this president where he has to prove that he didn't do anything wrong, simply because they don't like what is going on or they think there's suspicion of something that could actually -- they could latch onto.</p><p>They've latched onto nothing so far and I think what's going to become the story is more of what Mr. -- former Vice President Biden did. I think what we're seeing here is a leader who is talking to another leader. It is concerning how these continually from the intelligence communities get leaked out. So, we're going to see how this comes forward. But again, it's just a different standard for this president compared to anybody else in the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it is really hard to ignore the double standard here, especially as we are just coming off of two and half years where the entire public was out of their minds over Russia collusion. And there too, it was based on anonymous conversation, speculation, when in fact we know at the end of the day it was the Democrats who worked with the Russians to try to get dirt on President Trump.</p><p>COLLINS: Oh yes, the only true collusion that we found was the Democrats and the Russians in this but nobody wants to talk about that. In fact, we even found out last Friday and I think we've been trying to put this out there that we actually saw now evidence of Mr. McCabe in the discussions about wearing a wire tap. The start of the collusion issue came with Mr. McCabe. These are the kind of things that Democrats want to ignore.</p><p>They want to go back to a report that they've not seen, a transcript they've not seen to a report that is contingently at this point just simply speculative. But yet, trying to make the president prove something didn't happen. This is really where we got to go back to what actually did happen.</p><p>We know that there was a corrupt cabal of the DOJ. We know this got started bad, and by the way, wasn't there a president who actually got caught on a hot mic telling a Russian maybe that -- I'll be more flexible after the election. I didn't see the outrage then. It's all about this president and their focus on getting him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, are you going to be able to cut through the noise then and actually report the wrongdoing and actually see accountability for some of this? Whether it's the Russia collusion, if they made up a story and inserted Donald Trump into the meddling that the Russians were doing, or this story around this whistleblower? And what do we know about this whistleblower? What can you tell us?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, that's a great question because nobody knows at this point. It's all speculation. But it has been a whirlwind stirred up by the Democrats and frankly their willing accomplices in the media. The media has helped amplify every story that they've had.</p><p>Adam Schiff has proven, you know, to be frankly a liar on many different levels. When he says that there was collusion, then says that there was something wrong. My chairman is -- went out on a limb and said, oh there's always -- here, we can impeach him now. No, they can't.</p><p>And I think the problem here is that they get amplified with the media, who also went out there with them thinking impeachment was going to happen and now they're having to back track. What we're going to do is keep telling the truth.</p><p>I think that that's the best thing that you can do with the American people, is say here's what actually happened, here's what's going on, here's what the president is doing for the rest of the world and for our country. Let's focus on this, and focus on what actually happened instead of the speculation that has turned into nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, let me switch gears and ask you about the crackdown on big tech. Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president at the White House on Thursday. You met with Zuckerberg as well on Capitol Hill on Friday.</p><p>We know this morning this new story, Snap, has reportedly been talking to the Federal Trade Commission while compiling a dossier of ways that Facebook attempted to thwart competition, this is according to DOW Jones.</p><p>How did your meeting go with Zuckerberg? Tell us what you learned.</p><p>COLLINS: Well, the meeting went well. I think there was one -- the positive I will say is that Mr. Zuckerberg came. He was willing to sit down and talk about a wide ranging of issues, not only with privacy but also with beginning of this issue of anti-trust.</p><p>And that's where -- look (ph) - where the investigation for the House Judiciary Committee has been coming from. It's to say where are we in this new environment? How do we relate to companies that have a different source of income, a different source of media?</p><p>How do they dominate their marketplace when the actual -- the widget, so to speak of the old economy is not there? And he was very open to that. He understood the scrutiny, understood that why people were asking. And he was willing to -- begin to answer the questions that I believe that people need to hear.</p><p>Because if there is problems in the marketplace in this new economy, which is now the economy going forward, we need to make sure that our laws are appropriate for this but also hold them accountable in their new environment in their dominate market force.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, are you expecting the big tech companies to try to meddle in the U.S. election in 2020? We know what we heard from Google where they said we can never allow that to happen again, what happened in 2016. Somebody at Google was on tape saying that. We know that there's a liberal bias there. What are you expecting and how are you going to get in front of that, as you know you're trying to win the House back?</p><p>COLLINS: Exactly, and that was brought up. And I think this is the understanding, and I think Mr. Zuckerberg understood the perception out there, especially from conservatives in particular but others as well. They control such a massive marketplace and we saw that throughout the reports that have come out through the Mueller report even though the things were there actually using these kind of social apps to try and influence elections.</p><p>We've known it all along before. I think what we got to make sure is that the companies themselves are not putting themselves in a position of being political actors and political players. I think coming out of the last election we now see that there was a lot of bias in there, we see a lot of concern and we're ahead of that game now saying let's make sure, in putting pressure on them, that they cannot play one way or the other. They got to play it down the middle. If they want to be a publicly-held company appealing to the most people, they've got to have a political bias that is non-existent in their platform.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they they're not media companies and they're just technology platforms.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Devin Nunes is suing Twitter because he says Twitter is a content creator. Are you looking to get the law changed so that these companies operate under being media companies and not platforms because there is content, obviously, on these platforms?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, there is, and I think this was a conversation -- and I had a specific question to Mr. Zuckerberg about this. I said, here is the issue that you got understand. Section 230 or the, quote, \"Safe Harbor protections,\" here --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>COLLINS: -- are something that the tech companies have got to come to the table and discuss because they're there to protect the Internet so that people can post and do the things they want to do without being held responsible for somebody else's action. However, if you, like a newspaper or a news channel such as yours, if they're going to edit or content things that we don't like or things that could get us in trouble --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>COLLINS: -- maybe to one side or the other, then that's a problem. We've got to face that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much. We'll be watching the developments.</p><p>COLLINS: Look forward to it. Take care, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Doug Collins is the Ranking Member on Judiciary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Doug Collins is the ranking member on Judiciary. Coming up, the fracking controversy.

They are arguing that they're entitled to free rent when they move back home after college. Parents -- some parents are saying, not under my roof. The heated household debate coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The first trades in Bitcoin Futures executed at the New York Stock Exchange last night. Jackie DeAngelis on the floor of the big board this morning with details. Hey, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hi, Maria. Good morning to you. That's right, bitcoin futures launched by Intercontinental Exchange of the parent company of the NYSE last night. 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time was the print on the first trade and it was a little bit more than $10,000. This is part of a new initiative called (INAUDIBLE) and it's trying to make cryptocurrencies more transparent, easier for investors and traders to understand.</p><p>Meantime, I want to talk to you about Disney+ because you can preorder it. $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year, that brings it down to $5.00 and change. If you want the bundle, you're going to have to wait until November 12, that's the launch date, and that'll give you Disney+, ESPN Plus, and you'll get Hulu, ad supported Hulu, that is, and that'll be $12.99 a month.</p><p>Meantime, final story, WeWork, we're looking at that company because CEO Adam Neumann, he's been an impediment for this company and it's being reported that directors are asking him to step down from the CEO role. The company, of course, not only delaying its IPO, but now reports surfacing regarding Neumann with eccentric, erratic behavior and potentially even drug use so interesting to see how this story unfolds. So many twists and turns, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie, we'll be watching. By the way, Stephanie Grisham just told us the first lady's going to be ringing the opening bell down there --</p><p>DEANGELIS: Yes, she is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- at the Big Board. We'll look for that.</p><p>DEANGELIS: She will be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Jackie.</p><p>DEANGELIS: OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The U.S. is an energy giant with fracking playing a big part. Joining us right now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in the air, and thankfully, Stu --</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- on the heels of that attack on the Saudi oil fields last week, it wasn't as big a deal because of that very fact.</p><p>VARNEY: Precisely. If that attack had happened, say, five years ago, and it had knocked down maybe half of Saudi Arabia's oil production, I guarantee that the price of gasoline today would be $5.00 a gallon or a whole lot more. Instead, it's $2.66 a gallon nationwide average, and that's because, America -- American frackers are able to make up the short fall in the world's oil supply.</p><p>Now this is a -- this is a huge win for America's freedom of action. It's a big win for the president and his insistence upon energy independence and energy dominance. It allows us to act at will overseas rather than responding to attacks on the oil supply. And there's one more point I think we should make, watch out, Senators Warren and Sanders, who want to ban fracking. Do they really want to ban fracking and see gas go up $5.00, $6.00, $7.00 a gallon or more? Because that's what would happen. Just saying, Maria. Just saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's it. We haven't really heard them talk about the implications of all of that, but, yes, you make a good point. Stu, I'll see you in about, what, 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you have a lot more top of the hour. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Join Stuart right after. But first, pay up, millennials. They are arguing that they're entitled to free rent when they move back home after college. Parents are not saying it's true, they're saying not under my roof. The heated household debate when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More and more millennials are living at home now than at any other point this century. The big question, should they pay rent? Kristina Partsinevelos headed back to school for some answers. Kristina.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, I hit campus and I guess I got to be like the resident millennial that's why I'm doing it, but we often talk about students and student debts and the fact that it's climbed up to $1.6 trillion and it's going to grow even up to $2 trillion. You have these complaints often from millennials that they can afford anything. There was a recent survey from Northern -- Northwestern Mutual saying that right now, the personal debt level of millennials is at $28,000, and that's not even due to student debt, that's due to credit cards.</p><p>And then there was another survey that came just within the past few days from YouGov, they interviewed over 1,200 adults and -- oh, adults being over the age of 18 and they found that millennials are the loneliest. So, you have all of these various. They're laughing right now. You have these surveys pointing to millennials and their costs, and so many are still opting to stay home so I wouldn't ask then, why are still living at home and do you think you should be paying rent? Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Do you think a lot of the younger generation is living in the home past 30 and just staying in their mom's basement?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I recognize that trend, yes, that's true, but if it's allowed by the parents, why should it not be allowed?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My generation is having the most difficult time actually affording living.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: How do you feel about younger generation staying home a lot longer and not paying their parents anything?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I guess like guilt because I do that. It's like a little bit guilty. But at the same time, if my parents asked me to pay rent, I'd be outraged.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's the parents right to the side, whether that's something that they want to do, but they if their parent says you've got to pay up or get out, then that's also their right.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I don't have a lot of savings. I don't think it's fair.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think that it's actually more difficult than ever for people who are like 22 to live well on their own.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: You're admitting that the younger generation could be potentially more entitled and yet you're not changing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No, I'm taking advantage of it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think we work just as hard. I just think we have less opportunities available.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a little difficult to say. You know, I'm thousands of thousands of dollars in debt. Let me go pay $3,000 a month on rent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not lazy, but I don't really do the -- like I guess like mainstream productive things.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: What's the mainstream productive things?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Like get a job.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: (INAUDIBLE) I know we can often hate on millennials, but how do you feel about that just in general? Are the younger generation -- is -- are they entitled? Is it really because they can't afford anything that they shouldn't be paying rent to their parents?</p><p>PAYNE: I think it's -- I think it's unfair. I think it's really unfair. You do this all the time, but I think we forget who millennials are now, right? First of all, it's like 80 million people, the oldest ones are in their late 30s now.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I'm an elder, just --</p><p>PAYNE: So there we go, yes. Exactly an elder millennial.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: In the flesh. And I think you'll -- I can just anecdotally from our wealth management practice that if you're a millennial on your 30s, you're making really good money now. You've moved up the corporate hierarchy. Why are you laughing? And, you know, a lot of millennials are making a lot of money. They're more conservative than their parents.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They should pay up, you say.</p><p>PAYNE: I think they've -- they should pay up also the noose of student debt around their neck, but they're doing really, really well and I think the stats paint the wrong picture about (INAUDIBLE) so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what do you guys think?</p><p>PEEK: think part of it's the rents are too high.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: I mean that's -- it seems to me what -- when you start to talk to young people about their housing options, they don't have any. I mean they'd have no money to put or the down payment in part because of student, but also just because their young. And they -- and the rents are out of control</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you don't the mind kids coming back to the nest.</p><p>PEEK: Oh, I had one or two (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: My mother -- thank you. My mother loved it, too.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, yes, let's not be too aggressive putting that invitation out like (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>PEEK: You see your future there.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think the youngest millennials are 25 years old, so maybe it's time to start thinking about the next chapter if they're still in the basement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. All good thoughts. Kristina, thank you.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: No problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) first. Still ahead, final thoughts from this all- star panel, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN: This would be a great week to get a new trade deal. Maybe Japan, maybe someone in Europe, but let's hope we get some good news from President Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sounded like Stephanie Grisham felt that Japan is imminent there. Liz, what (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>PEEK: Yes, and India, we're talking India, too. Today, we have the manufacturing and services PMI coming out. Latest read on the economy. That's going to be a big news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's going to be important because manufacturing has weakened a bit.</p><p>PEEK: Exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see about that. Ryan.</p><p>PAYNE: And don't play up the manufacturing. We're a service-based economy focused on that number, that's one you really want to look at, which should be good. And be bullish.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sounds like you are -- you want to own stocks here.</p><p>PAYNE: Oh, in a -- in a -- in a big way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, in a big way. OK. Great. Great to have everybody this morning.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>PEEK: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was -- it was a busy day. We got the U.N. week. We'll be watching all that and we'll see you soon. Thanks so much, Ryan, Liz, and James. That'll do it for us. Have a great day, everybody. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tough talk on trade.  China firing back against President Trump.  The state  media blasting the administration, saying extortion won't work.  The  President Trump, doubling down on his policies over the weekend at a rally  in Ohio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Checking the markets, let's check.  You know what is going for President  Trump?  His rhetoric on trade it's working, he has his base fired up Lee  Carter is going to talk about that, coming up.  And also, this economy,  it's in Fuego.  And the futures are showing that this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We have gained across the board.  This coming off the fifth week in a row  that the Dow and S&amp;P have been up, and the real winner has been the NASDAQ  in terms of top performance.  It was up nearly one percent on the week.   Apple, hitting a $1 trillion market cap.  The first U.S. company to ever do  that.</p><p> All of this in terms of wages growing at the fastest pace in 10 years.   Inflation still tame, you name it.  It's going well for the United States  of America.  In Europe, we have gains across the board to tell you about.   And England, France, and Germany, no we don't, the markets have completely  turned in the other direction.  We have losses at the moment.</p><p> In Asia, overnight it was mixed action.  The Shanghai composite the worst  performer there.  The Hang Seng managing to eke out a gain of half of one  percent.</p><p> Earnings season rolls on.  SeaWorld and Tyson among the names reporting  this morning.  What is driving stocks higher?  Coming up.  Try earnings  growth north of 24 percent.  That's much better than analysts expected to  start the reporting season.</p><p> A heroic rescue caught on camera.  Atlanta police pull a man out of a  burning car.  More of the unbelievable video later this hour.  Samsung set  to unveil its latest iPhone rival.  Images of the new device leaked,  Samsung is behind it.  And it's party time for one panda.  A zoo  celebrating the first birthday of its newest edition with a cake made of  bamboo and fruit.</p><p> All of that and so much more coming up this morning.  Maslansky and Partner  President Lee Carter, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.  I had to cut you off because we're up  against a hard break.  But I agree that Conor McGregor it is the fight of - - maybe the century so far, coming up.</p><p> MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE:  Yes, actually -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it but they got to keep them from getting in trouble because  the issue you were talking about is he was -- he threw a hand truck and a  van full of fighters out at the bar at the Barclays Center out in Brooklyn,  and he ended up being on the legal trouble.</p><p> BAKER:  Yes, no, look, he is a beast but -- you know, you can do a little  home predictable so I think they're going to try to manage -- you know,  this is lead up to the fight because this, I had a massive fight, the  payday is huge.</p><p> If you're talking about China, it's true, quick.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, please, quick.</p><p> BAKER:  I think, people need to watch what China is saying right now.   They're ratcheting up the rhetoric a little rhetoric a little bit, and it's  becoming more personal which is not typical for them.  So, I think what  we're seeing from that is their reaction to what's happening within their  own economy.</p><p> And this is a very interesting time, but also a very difficult time.  And  we need to manage this properly because again, and we talked about this  earlier, a destabilized Chinese economy is not going to do us any good in  the long run.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Rhetoric that becomes increasingly personal against the  president.</p><p> BAKER:  Against the administration, against President Trump.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because we know he has talked about Xi Jinping, his friend.  But  -- </p><p> BAKER:  Who is president for life basically now?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, but -- you know, you start making it personal with  President Trump and things generally don't go well.  So -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Yes, but that thing said,  people really think that the president is doing the right thing by fan of  China, they're still supporting this on both like on all sides.  To say  they expect them like two-thirds of Americans think this is the right  strategy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And my issue is and I've been very vocal about it.  In the  meantime, we've taken aback to our allies at the same time.  And in  Americans whose jobs are at risk or have been hurt by higher prices.</p><p> So, there you go.  Let's talk China going in on Trump's tariff threats,  saying, he's starring in his own, \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of  extortion and intimidation.\"</p><p> The president plans to stay the course on trade.  Let's go to Blake Burman  live in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey near where the president is taking a  working vacation.  Blake, what's the latest?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  As you guys were just talking about the Chinese ratcheting  up the rhetoric over the weekend.  The latest coming in a state-run  editorial of the -- that editorial described the president as engaging in  what they described as \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of extortion,  and intimidation.\"</p><p> The president though over the weekend saying that he gets along with the  Chinese.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Look, I don't blame China.   I don't blame any of these countries, I don't have to go through them I've  got some good relationships.  Believe it or not they all like me, they  understand.  They can't believe themselves they got away with it.  They  can't believe that they got away with, but they have and we're turning it  around, we're turning it around fast.</p><p> BURMAN:  Both sides appear to be dug in here, because the Chinese saying  that the U.S. and China right now are engaged in a quote, \"zero-sum\" game.   While members of the Trump administration continue to say that President  Trump will not blink.</p><p> JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Don't underestimate  President Trump's resolve here.</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   How far are you prepared  to take those?</p><p> BOLTON:  Far enough to get China to change its behavior, and they need to  understand that.</p><p> WALLACE:  And, if they don't change their behavior?</p><p> BOLTON:  I think, the pressure will continue.  I think the president's made  that very clear.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BURMAN:  The president, now unveiling a new argument over the weekend  Dagen, he tweeted out the following at one point, writing, \"Because of  tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21  trillion in debt that has been accumulated.  It's unclear though, Dagen, exactly how that specific math there checks  out?  Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman for us in New Jersey.</p><p> BURMAN:  We got it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Mark Penn, a former Clinton adviser Stagwell  Group president, author of the book Microtrends Squared.  Mark, I said  earlier as a person, I consider myself to be a fiscal conservative.  I  don't think, I've ever seen a Republican president in my lifetime brag  about tax increases because that's essentially what he was doing.  And it's  actually not the first time I've heard him say that at least, one of the  rallies recently.</p><p> MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISER OF BILL CLINTON:  Well, I think you have to look  at these tariffs as strategic bargaining chips.  I mean, I think, you know  what, I've seen President Trump do over and over again is when he doesn't  really have anything to bargain with, he creates things to bargain with.</p><p> And that's what I think what he's done with the tariffs.  And when it comes  to China, the public really does support him in China.  They think China  has been stealing American jobs for a long time, stealing American  technology, and is out for world economic domination on the back of  America.</p><p> CARTER:  You know, Mark, this is Lee Carter speaking.  I am -- I'm  fascinated by how Americans are reacting to all of this.  And really -- in  general saying that they support what the president is doing with China,  and believe exactly what you said that these are really strategic  bargaining chips that he's using with.  And think in a long-term, we're  going to win.</p><p> And we're seeing the president's approval ratings eke up.  On the other  hand, we're seeing independents starting to -- in the most recent polls we  thought were just talking about NBC poll that just came out saying that the  independents are actually softening towards the president.  What are you  seeing in your polls?</p><p> PENN:  Well, look, we had at the Harvard caps, Harris Poll.  We had the  president at about 45 percent approval.  We didn't really show dramatic  change.  I think to the extent, the president is sticking up it's because  of the economic straight.</p><p> 70 percent of Americans now say that we have a strong economy, and that  really is the biggest change in the poll in the last year.</p><p> I think that's up about 15 points or so.  And that is the tremendous shift,  and that is what is holding him up because he's got a 55 percent approval  there.  On the other side, immigration -- you know, the tariffs, he could  have waited till after the midterms on the tariffs because it does create - - you know, some controversy particularly in terms of Europe and Mexico,  and but not China, they do support him on China.  And that's kind of what  we're saying.</p><p> CARTER:  You know, the other thing that I'm really, really interested in  when it comes to the -- comes to the polling is voter enthusiasm.  And as  we're going into the midterms, it's sort of been flip-flopping over who's  more enthusiastic, Democrats or Republicans?</p><p> And as we're looking at the war on the media or the media -- you know, back  and forth between the president, and it seems like the war on what's  happening with the media, and the media attacking the president all the  time, did he energizing Republicans more?  What do you see?</p><p> PENN:  Yes, I think everybody is going to be energized.  I am going to be  fascinating, we're going to be fascinated about what happens on Tuesday  night here in this -- in this special election in a Republican district in  Ohio.</p><p> I -- look, I think that the president has made the choice here energize his  base.  Go out and rally after rally, and do what worked for him in the  presidential.</p><p> A little risky because the question is, \"Are independent women in suburban  districts who have voted more Republican than anybody realizes going to  drift Democratic?  And that's really the big question.  And the more he  plays to the base, to the working class that doesn't typically show out,  the show up in midterms, the more he may lose some of the well-educated  suburban voters who typically do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But, Mark, I will say this, and we saw it in 2016.  Women,  wives, mothers vote on the economy.  This economy is growing at the fastest  pace in four years north of four percent it could grow even faster in the  current quarter based on the most recent estimates.</p><p> Job growth on average this year is faster than it was last year at this  time which is incredible for an economy into nine years of an expansion.   Wages are growing at the fastest pace in a decade.  And then, you have good  news even on Obamacare in premiums aren't going up as much as people  expected.  They're actually falling according to reports to some of these  state insurance commissioners.</p><p> I think that it's hard to find anything wrong.  This is -- and look at  this, the USDA showed that nearly 3 million Americans have come off of food  stamps since President took office.  Again, that's what women vote on.</p><p> PENN:  Well, and of course, if I were working with President Clinton, and  we had numbers like that, his ratings would be in the stratosphere and he'd  be untouchable.  So, the fact that's not the case shows you that, that  message hasn't gotten through yet. </p><p> Certainly, the idea that 3 million are off food stamps hasn't gotten  through.  It's an important message because the big question here with the  tax cuts is, \"Did it just benefit the big corporations or did the working  class and even the working poor benefit?  And truth is that you say a lot  of statistics are coming out.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you need the message?  Do you need the messages, though?  90  percent of Americans got a pay hike because of the tax cuts earlier this  year.  90 percent of people are seeing fatter paychecks.  Do you need to  message that?</p><p> Do -- there -- again, it kind of comes back to do his approval ratings and  do the polls even matter because they sure as heck didn't matter going into  the election almost two years ago?</p><p> PENN:  Well, but the public is fed up, the Congress doesn't seem to be able  to do anything.  I do think the Republicans have a leader who has quit,  doesn't even support the President on tariffs.  And yet, is staying in  office.  I've said consistently with you that I think the biggest  Republican weakness is they have no message and the leadership.</p><p> The Democrats have weaknesses too.  You know, headed by Pelosi, someone  who's really disliked throughout the country and featuring socialist.   That's why a voter who is going to go into the polls who's not energized in  the middle is truly confused about which way to vote.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you said, Nancy Pelosi, let's also talk about Senator  Elizabeth Warren, which she was fueling rumors of a presidential run over  the week and saying, she well -- you can just listen to this, she's not  afraid to be the underdog.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  It won't be  easy.  We're going to have to fight uphill.  But me, I'm going up that hill  and I hope you are too.  And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your  hand out and bring someone else along for the climb.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In terms of policy platform, it's abortion and open borders.  I  don't know how that wins.</p><p> PENN:  Well, if you look at the Democrats in the Democratic primary,  actually, Biden has been rising and not Elizabeth Warren.  Elizabeth Warren  gets all the publicity, but he went out -- you know, this week with  President Obama.</p><p> You know, I think begin -- he has been very quietly position himself.   Look, I don't think Elizabeth Warren would be the best Democratic  presidential candidate.  And -- you know, the Pelosi Warren team is really  too far to the left for America.</p><p> But I don't think that's where the rank-and-file Democrats are, and I don't  think that's how this is going to play out come three years from now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joe Biden taking a selfie with President Obama with a big grin  on his face.  Well, I think that every American could write the caption for  that.  Mark Penn, thank you so much.</p><p> PENN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you my friend, Mark Penn.  Coming up, an  unbelievable rescue.  Police in Atlanta pull a man out of a burning car.   Details on the heroic action straight ahead.  And Samsung unveiling its  newest phone this week.  The detail is already out because Samsung leaked  them.  That story later this hour.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A Philadelphia Police Officer is in the hospital  after being shot in the face this morning.  Kristina Partsinevelos has the  details.  Kristina?</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  The  officer was shot in the face while serving a warrant.  He is identified as  49-year-old Jason Potts.  A 20-year veteran of the force and a member of  the SWAT team.  Officer Potts suffered heavy bleeding and at least a broken  jaw.  Police say he is expected to survive though.  </p><p> Tourists are fleeing after a powerful earthquake in Indonesia.  Magnitude  7.0 quake hitting the tourist island of Lombok killing about 100 people.   More than 230 others seriously injured.  The death toll is expected to rise  and search operations continue.  It's the second deadly -- deadliest quack  in just one week to hit that island.  A July 29th quake killed 16 people  and damaged hundreds of homes.</p><p> And there is more trouble at Wells Fargo.  The bank said the calculation  error may have caused hundreds of people to lose their homes to foreclosure  between 2010 and 2015.  According to a regulatory filing, Wells Fargo said  the mistake was made in a formula used to qualify struggling homeowners for  Federally-backed assistance programs.  The bank has set aside $8 million or  about $20,000 per affected customer.</p><p> Shares of Wells Fargo are down three percent today but up this morning.   And PepsiCo CEO announcing plans to step down after leading the company for  12 years.  Indra Nooyi will leave in October and she will be succeeded by  Ramon Laguarta.  Nooyi, a 24-year old veteran at PepsiCo will remain  chairman at the board until early next year.  Shares of PepsiCo slightly in  premarket trading.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Kristina.  Extremely tough job, Mitch  Roschelle.  And at the time that Pepsi is under pressure in terms of its  fizzy drinks business but also with these tariffs.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And took global business and just not operating and selling  your product to consumers and business in one country, selling around the  world and that's a challenging job by any stretch with tariffs, it's even  more complicated.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And trade spats that are --</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And currencies that are not moving in the direction people that  people thought they were moving, so --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's very difficult to plan your business that way but a  great run for a well-known woman at the top of one great American company.  </p><p> CARTER:  She is an extraordinary leader with an extraordinary vision.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You -- I want to give you a quiz.  I hate when people do this  but Pepsi was invented where?  Coke was invented in Atlanta.  Where was  Pepsi invented?  New Bern, North Carolina, Mitch Roschelle.</p><p> BAKER:  Oh, you think it was time to answer her.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he didn't know.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  OK.  I wrote it down right here, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That's right.  Thank you so much.  Coming up.  A whale  sized surprise.  Seaworld reporting better-than-expected sales.  The stock  jumping on the news.  A closer look at what people back to the park  straight ahead.  Plus, a birthday bash fit for a giant panda.  A zoo  celebrates its newest bear cub with a cake of bamboo and fruit. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Social media gets political again.  Twitter apologizing after it  suspended conservative commentator Candace Owens for response to a set of  anti-white tweets by New York Times editorial board member.  This is a new  higher.  This as reports indicate executives and top board members from the  social media giant have donated overwhelmingly to Democrats.</p><p> Lee, your reaction to this.  Candace Owens basically took anti-white tweets  from this new hire by the New York Times and replaced certain her words in  as -- to illustrate the insanity and hideousness of what this woman at The  New York Times had been tweeting.  That woman said that it was -- I guess  she was trying to illustrate irony or something like that.  Nevertheless,  your reaction.  </p><p> CARTER:  So my reaction is A, she should not have been suspended, B, I can  understand from a machine learning perspective how this could have been  taken down as hate speech.  But what I don't understand is why it just  would have been blocked like so many other things or rather than saying  that we're going to suspend her.  And thirdly, I really think that if this  is going to be the policy of a social media company like Twitter they need  to be able to respond more quickly.</p><p> To have this happen for 12 hours, to go with no response, to go and say  nothing for a long time is a real problem for them and when I think that  Twitter really needs to remember is that, there is a huge number of  conservatives between ages 27 and 32.  In fact there was more conservatives  than there are liberals.  So they better do something about this.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's become -- Mike, how do you feel of about this?  Because I  have noticed and I mentioned with Jessica Tarlov that conservatives have  put in a bright red X next to their names to push back on Twitter, their  way of expressing dissatisfaction with the shadow banning that we've been  going on like where in search results, conservative names are essentially  buried or don't even show up at all.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Look, I'm shocked that Twitter leadership overwhelmingly  supports Democrats.  I picked up the New York Times, I know I'm reading a  paper with a certain lean, right?  I pick up the Wall Street Journal same  way.  You know, it's the world we live in.  I get on Twitter, I know where  they're going, right?  I know what their agenda in a sense is, and so I'm  not surprised.</p><p> And -- I guess bigger issue for me is just we -- where is the civility in  any of the dialogue whether it's on social media or face to face or on, you  know, traditional media.  We seem to have lost the inability, right?  To  speak rationally speak to people having a different point of view.  We've  lost our --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here are the two things -- the most hideous things that have  been said to me on Twitter by people on left, they need to reopen Auschwitz  to gas and incinerate you and I can't wait until Iran wipes Israel off the  map so I can watch you cry.  These people were not disciplined by Twitter,  they shouldn't have accounts, should they?</p><p> It's a private organization, they should -- but again, the level of hate --  and these are people, who -- go by their own names who were sitting at home  spewing this kind of hatred and if I -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BAKER:  But it's on both sides.  It's on both -- to be honest it's -- both  the hard sides, right?  Both the far right, the far left are sitting in  their trenches throwing hand grenades saying equally despicable things.   Nobody exists in the center anymore.  You don't have to agree with  somebody's position, right?  You don't have to read -- you're just fine.   But figure out a way to have a conversation without being -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, on the left anti-semitism is alive and well and I  don't even -- and they don't -- people, liberals don't acknowledge it, I  see it every day and I can say with no hesitation that the nastiest that  ever been said to me on social media were from the left.  People who preach  -- you know, 40 years ago preaching peace, love, and happiness.  Let's all  locked arms and we are against big government and helping one another.</p><p> Well, that just died.  I don't know when but it just died. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Well, no doubt about it.  I mean, Antifa, the big joke about  them is that they think they are, you know, this group that's out to, you  know, to promote free speech and yet they bludgeon anybody who doesn't  agree with them.  And they don't get the joke about that, they don't see  how ironic that is.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And cowards wearing black masks, I should point that out.   Cowards wearing -- covering their faces.  </p><p> BAKER:  You're not a good look for them. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming.  A massive pile up twisted steel and metal left behind  after freight train derails in Pittsburgh.  The latest on the investigation  into that crash.  Plus, Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 details leaked from  Samsung.  We will tell you what happened.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:   Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, August 6th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  China state  media attacks President Trump, over his proposed tariffs.  Look out a  state-run paper calling the tariffs extortion saying that president is  starring in his own street fighter style defeatful drama.  President Trump  says that the tariffs are all about getting America on track.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p> TRUMP:  But America's economic surrender ended the day that I took office,  folks.  Now after years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally  rebuilding our country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mike Baker said look out because China is getting all the more  personal, and when people make personal attacks on President Trump -- we've  kind of seen that movie before, we know what happens to them.  </p><p> Futures are showing a flat market at the start of trading to start this new  week.  We have some slight gains on the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ 100 futures.   But last week, the Dow and S&amp;P up for their fifth week in a row.  The  NASDAQ, bright shining star is well up more than one percent.  </p><p> In Europe, we've been watching markets.  We've been touting between green  and red gains, now some losses across the board in England, France, and  Germany, although slight loses.  In Asia overnight, the market's mostly  lower as well.  The Seoul winner, with the Hang Seng up half of one  percent.  </p><p> And explosion near an airport in Italy.  Police are tweeting that it was  caused by an accident on a highway.  We'll bring you the latest from Italy.   And a nightmare on the tracks.  A Norfolk southern train derailed in  Pittsburgh yesterday.  We bring you the details from this tragedy.  Hero  caught on video.  Body cam footage showing an Atlanta police officer making  a daring rescue from a burning car.  </p><p> And hold the phone.  New details out from Samsung on their latest phone we  will break it down.  And unbearably cute, a panda in France, celebrates his  first birthday.  Complete with a cake.  Made of fruit and bamboo.  We will  play panda videos and baby goat videos all day long.    </p><p> To our top story this half hour.  Markets shaking up trade tensions.   President Trump using the stock market as a measure of who's winning the  trade dispute, and indicating that U.S. has a clear lead over China.   Listen to this:</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p> TRUMP:  If I didn't do anything with the trade deals, if I said nothing,  we're going to let everybody continue to take our jobs, take our wealth,  let them continue -- you know, I bet our stock market is up almost 40  percent since I won.  But if I didn't do anything with trade, just kept  quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us.  Nobody says anything.  I  think you would've been up another 40, 50, 60 percent.  But eventually, you  would have had to pay the piper eventually, and we're not going to do.   We're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer  than it has ever been.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now: Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment  Institute Head Global Market Strategist.  Paul, why has the markets been  able to shake off the trade tensions, the trade worry so much?  </p><p> PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Well, though, the market believes and we agree, that a deal is  the ultimate goal here that the goal is not to run the Chinese economy into  the ground or the U.S. economy into ground with unending tariffs.  They can  get a negotiation on the trade deficit, getting the Chinese to buy more  from this country, and if they can get a deal on autos with the Mexicans,  the Canadians, and the Europeans then we think the trade talk, the  rhetoric, dies down a bit or is dialed back.  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC U.S.:  Hey, Paul, Mitch Roschelle.  You  mentioned China and their economy, some of the challenges that their  economy sort of predate the trade war, their markets are sort of in free- fall, their currency is diminishing, and they are growing middle class, and  the funding of entitlements for the middle class is really starting to put  pressure on their ability to grow and you see that in GDP numbers.  So,  regardless, don't we still have a global challenge that China's economy  that's going to impact other global economies if this trade war isn't  sorted out.  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Well, you're absolutely right, Mitch, the moderation in  growth around the world, Europe I mention, too had slowed down some.  That  is confusing the markets a little bit here.  They're thinking that all of  the slowdown is related to trade talk.  It's not.  The slowdown is  predating the trade talk and it's an important factor.  The Chinese -- we  need to remember, the Chinese have an economy that on the one hand, has  very strong consumer growth, and on the other hand has a lot of debt.  And  as you mentioned, some issues with the providing social welfare.  So, how  are they going to balance that going forward?  They need to be very careful  with that and they don't need extra variable in there, if you will, of  trade uncertainty.  So, we think there's pressure on Chinese internally to  come to the negotiating table.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Debt is a huge issue, though, Paul.  And let's talk about what  we're paying as nation to borrow right now.  JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie  Dimon, warning investors over the weekend to prepare for five percent  interest rates -- that would be yield on the 10-year treasury.  And this  certainly is a major concern; it's not showing up in the markets so much at  this point, but now that back to running one trillion-dollar deficits,  we're in a fight with one of the largest holders of our own debt.  Someone  we've leaned on China and relied upon to buy our debt and fund deficit.   Your reaction to this?  Is there any way in the near-term that we even get  back to four percent on the 10-year yield?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  We don't think that there's much chance of getting to back to  four percent any time soon.  On the 10-year yield, yes, the debt is a  weight on the economy, call it a headwind for growth.  And no, we don't  think the Chinese are about ready to dump their holdings of U.S.  Treasuries.  Treasuries are simply the largest, the most liquid market in  the world.  And if you're a government that needs to hold trillions of  dollars of reserves, there's no other place for you to go but to hold U.S.  Treasury. </p><p> So, we don't think there's a real threat there.  But yes, the debt is going  to be a headwind for the economy going forward.  On the other hand, you've  got, still, quite a demographic challenge going forward as many of us age  and get into the retirement years.  We're going to be holding a lot more  debt anyway, that's going to help keep yield a little lower.  Our target  for 10-year treasury of this year is in the low threes, and we don't see it  moving up to four any time soon -- rather low yields look to us to be  continue to be the main problem for investors.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, is an aging population and those who will be holding more  safe, if you will, treasuries, is that bad for the stock market then?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Well, what it does for the stock market when the yields are  low, relatively low on treasury, we've been hanging around three percent  here.  That means that you can have a little bit higher stock market  prices, before stocks get overvalued.  So, we don't think that stocks are  too rich right now, and part of that argument is that the 10-year is just  not making the sort of headway that would get you to four or five percent.   If we were to see that, we'd be more worried about stocks.  </p><p> BAKER:  Paul, going book to -- sorry, Mike Baker, here, going back to  tariffs question: There's a bit of a -- softening in the talk between U.S.  administration, and the E.U. now, and tariffs skirmish.  Do you expect the  same development in our conversations with China?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the I think Chinese know that there's a deal available  for them any time they want to take it.  But they're just not sure whether,  whether they should go now or later.  We think there will be a deal  sometime.  There's a good window for that opening up in the fall.  But the  Chinese simply need to figure out a way to close that -- some of that trade  deficit.  They could buy more liquid natural gas, they could buy more crude  oil, they could buy more soybeans.  Certainly, they need all of those  things in greater quantities than before.  </p><p> And I think if they were to do that, they would make -- they would come a  long way towards meeting the president in a deal.  So, I think that's, in  the end, where they'll finally go is making some kind of deal on trade.   The U.S. and the Europeans also have talking to do, not a done deal yet  there either.  But, again, the president probably wants to see those two  things, some sort of deal on autos and some sort of deal with the Chinese  on the trade deficit.  And then we think that the trade negotiations seem  to a lower priority and for the markets and we can get back to thinking  about good earnings growth going forward. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Paul, real quick, why is the opening in terms of having  discussions with China, why is that in the fall what about the timing of  that?  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the -- you've got midterm elections coming up here --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  -- In U.S.  And the president is still putting out their  additional tariffs and the Chinese feel obliged to respond.  I think  they're still gauging each other's degree of seriousness that the president  in our view, since the beginning, has been serious.  But some people maybe  have been thinking that, well, he would be eventually bend or making  exceptions.  That's not been the case.  So, they need to get back talking  again.  There's some evidence that the Chinese are interested in that.  It  just has to happen sometime in the next few months, we thing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the stock market just keeps chugging along.  Paul  Christopher, thank you so much.  Take care.    </p><p> CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up, incredible rescue caught on tape.  A  police officer in Atlanta pulls a man out of a burning car.  You have to  see more of this hero in action.  Plus, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, all  aiming to be the next to join Apple at a $1 trillion valuation.  Stuart  Varney makes a big prediction about those tech titans.  Mitch Roschelle is  going hmm, we all are.  Mr. Varney is next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Second quarters earning season rolls on this week at a slower  pace.  But Tyson Foods and Sea World have reported this morning.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more, Nicole. </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  So, there's been a lot of optimism surrounding the earnings 24.2  percent gain for earnings overall, year-over-year growth.  So, that's  surpassing analysts' estimates in 43 companies this week.  Take a look at  two that have already kicked it out: Tyson Foods and Sea World.  Sea World  up 15 percent; Tyson Food up three percent, this morning.  So, Tyson Foods  CEO, we did see that Tyson Foods -- this was a beat on profit.  Also, the  cattle prices have been falling; the food prices have been falling, and  they've increased herd size, and size of the heavier animals.  That offset  the impact of falling bacon pork prices.  This is apparent of Ball Park  Frank's hot dogs and Jimmy Dean's sausages.  </p><p> And then, there's Sea World.  What the CEO is saying that the quarter  benefitted from new marketing initiatives, strategic pricing, positive  reception to rises and such, the attendance on rise, and it was the revenue  that wowed Wall Street.  In fact, this is the third time in a row, third  straight, beat on top lines.  So, this is a winner, no doubt, for Sea  World.  And you could see it is up 15 percent.  That's going to be heavily  traded in a big mover today.  </p><p> Just as far as market commentary, Jeff Saut over at Raymond James,  everybody's been somewhat concerned about the sector rotation out of tech - - out of tech and out of consumer cyclicals, and have they moved into cash?   No, in fact, they've moving been moving it into industrials and financials,  and some other consumer non-cyclicals.  And he said, this sector rotation  is healthy, it's associated with a healthy bull market.  They're also a  little positive on Apple, and little weak on CBS this morning.  Back to  you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Apple, the first to cross the finish line to  $1 trillion in its valuation.  Several other big tech names are close  behind.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  You  have a prediction, sir?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, wait a minute, wait a  minute, wait a minute.  I just want to take our audience back to the Fox  News Channel on Friday afternoon where you made a stellar appearance on  \"THE FIVE,\" as I recall.  I thought you were really, really cool.  And it  occurred to me, you and I go back about 10 years now, working together in  the Fox Business Network for about 10 years.  What's the biggest story that  you and I have covered in those 10 years?  Don't answer, I think -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love you.</p><p> VARNEY:  I think it is the extraordinary performance and the gain in  valuation of those five big technology companies.  Apple is already worth a  trillion.  You've got Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really close, well  above 800 billion, and Facebook is down there at 500 billion.  But  essentially, I've never seen anything like this before.  You've never seen  the accumulation of wealth and power as we have seen in the last couple of  years in those five american technology companies.  There's going to be  cause to break them up, but nonetheless, they are there, they're  exceptionally powerful.  I think it's a unique moment in our financial  history.  Amazon, Google, microsoft, you get a good rally this year, and  from where we are now, and all three of them will join Apple at a trillion- dollar valuation, extraordinary stuff.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It really is important though, Stuart, that you highlight it in  the way that you do every day on your show, but in this -- in this moment  as well, and I said this because we very often -- you know, the news media  gets criticized so much, but many people are quite frankly lazy about it.   They don't have to do any homework, they can talk about President Trump and  his mental state.  But this is important to breathe and look at and  highlight because this is American greatness.</p><p> VARNEY:  And it doesn't get much coverage in the establishment newpapers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p> VARNEY:  They cover it in a negative way.  They've got too much power,  they've got too much wealth.  I cover it in a positive way.  All the money  they are making will flow out into different industries like cars, medical  devices, drugs, that -- money made out of computing power will flow out to  other industries and improve them.  I think it's very positive development.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And anybody in this country, if you own one share of an Apple or  a Microsoft or Amazon, or a Netflix, you're an owner in that company.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You own part of it and I think that that's worth -- that we're  all in it together.  We're all part of this greatness.</p><p> VARNEY:  Anybody with a 401(k), an IRA, a mutual fund, you benefited from  this, you've seen your retirement savings go up, and that is wholly good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amen and hallelujah.</p><p> VARNEY:  There's a mutual adoration society here, Dagen, I kind of like it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And thank you for the kind words.</p><p> VARNEY:  You're welcome.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's why we like working here because these are the people we  work with and we actually like each other off in here, and not faking it --  we're not faking it.</p><p> VARNEY:  Incredible.</p><p> BAKER:  And Stuart --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, we got to go.</p><p> BAKER:  Oh, we got to go.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love you, Mike.  That's Mike Baker.</p><p> VARNEY:  OK, Mike, love you, too.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A reminder, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m.  Eastern.  He is coming up in almost 11 minutes.  A birthday bash fit for a  giant panda.  A zoo celebrates its newest beer cub with a delicious treat  for a party of one.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  -- tumbling down on a hill on to light rail tracks, so  that's what you're seeing in the screen right now, the cars were carrying  consumer products but just food and housewares.  No injuries luckily have  been reported, and an investigation into the derailment is underway.  Train  service, though, has been suspended in the area.</p><p> An Atlanta Police officer is being hailed a hero this morning after saving  a passenger from a burning car last night, and it was all caught on his  body camera.  You can see the officer, he's about to run from the vehicle  and is dousing with a fire extinguisher.  Authorities say the car's engine  went up in flames after the car hit a metal utility pole.  Officials say  three people were taken to a local hospital.  Another officer suffered  minor scrapes and bruises.  What a video.</p><p>Samsung is out with a new sneak peek on its new Galaxy Note 9.  The company  unveiling this video for the smartphone in its YouTube channel.  It all but  confirms that the Note 9 will have the option for one terabyte of memory, a  massive amount of storage for all those videos and pictures we take.  The  Note 9 will apparently also come with 512 gigabytes of built in memory and  support for 512 gigabytes microsdcards, something not supported by the  iPhone, so those are difference right there.  </p><p> And we have to end the morning of the hour with a lovely video of a french  baby panda which treated to a unique cake to celebrate its first birthday,  bamboo, honey, and a variety of fruits went into the colorful cake.  The  young panda weighs about 60 pounds and probably packed a few more after his  B-Day celebration. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was in France, so of course, they have a delicious cake.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Chocolate cake, yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.  We need to get your expertise on something when guns  did the sports earlier, we had this video of a Mariners fan trying to catch  a ball with a bowl of poutine and failing miserably.</p><p> CARTER:  Oh, no, it's all over the floor.  So shameful, shameful.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Please explain what poutine is.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Poutine is or just like greasy French fry's gravy and  cheese curds.  But the cheese curds, when you chew them, they have to be  squeeky.  And there's an area in Quebec, St. Albert or St. Albert that  makes a lot of these cheese curds.  They're very popular, you can get all  kinds of topings on them, but the one you want to go for is the typical  gravy fries and cheese curds.  Super fatenning for you.</p><p> BAKER:  But now, Canada is not claiming they invented cheese curds, are  they?</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  No, no, but we didn't -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CARTER:  I'm an American now but (INAUDIBLE) invented the poutine back in  the late 1950s.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In a trucker.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  See, there's so much shared heritage and love of food between  the Canadians and people in the United States.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, exactly.  That's why I'm here, too.  We all get along.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, again, we're build -- we're building some bridges.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes.  I believe that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tariffs be dammed.  We're building culinary --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- we're building culinary bridges.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BAKER:  Over cheese kurds, yes.</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Yes, exactly.  Poutine, yes.</p><p> BAKER:  Poutine.  So, you heard it here.  You heard it here.  The U.S. and  Canada should be allies.  OK.  Got it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you --</p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  I'm glad I'm the expert.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hey, you're killing it today.  (INAUDIBLE) the whole nine yards.   Kristina Partsinevelos.  Coming up, final thoughts from our all stars when  we come back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We picked that song because it's one of Mike Baker's top  favorite songs of all-time.  Final thoughts from our all-stars.  Go!</p><p> BAKER:  Sure.  I can confirm that in Boise, we do have the goats gone wild  situation under control.  It is now safe to go back to Boise, it won't be  acoasted by roaming goats.  That's all I got.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We rank guys -- no, you've got more.  Give me something on China  real quick.</p><p> BAKER:  Heading there tomorrow.  We'll be back here with you guys in a  couple of weeks and we'll be looking forward to talking about what it looks  like on the ground there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are they going to give, are they going to step up and let us  actually negotiate different trade deals, Mitch?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The thing that concerns me is growing national debt.  We have  over $700 billion being refinanced of the next two quarters and that really  concerns me.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And Federal Reserve is pulling back on its balance sheet at the  same time and we're running $1-trillion budget.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  This is going to be a trillion-dollar deficit this year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lee?</p><p> CARTER:  A lot of criticisms about the polls, and whether or not they're  reliable.  I think what's important to look at the polls for is for  momentum and direction, and it looks like the President has weathered a  really tough storm.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Indeed, Lee Carter, Mitch Roschelle, and Mike Baker.  Thanks to  one and all, travel safely, we will see you tomorrer (ph) -- excuse me --  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts right now.  Stuart, it is all yours.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, it is, Dagen, good morning to you, thank you very much,  indeed.  And good morning, everyone.  Investors, how is this to start the  week, profit season in full swing, and big companies, their profit is  surging.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough talk on trade.  China firing back against President Trump.  The state  media blasting the administration, saying extortion won't work.  The  President Trump, doubling down on his policies over the weekend at a rally  in Ohio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Checking the markets, let's check.  You know what is going for President  Trump?  His rhetoric on trade it's working, he has his base fired up Lee  Carter is going to talk about that, coming up.  And also, this economy,  it's in Fuego.  And the futures are showing that this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have gained across the board.  This coming off the fifth week in a row  that the Dow and S&amp;P have been up, and the real winner has been the NASDAQ  in terms of top performance.  It was up nearly one percent on the week.   Apple, hitting a $1 trillion market cap.  The first U.S. company to ever do  that.</p><p>All of this in terms of wages growing at the fastest pace in 10 years.   Inflation still tame, you name it.  It's going well for the United States  of America.  In Europe, we have gains across the board to tell you about.   And England, France, and Germany, no we don't, the markets have completely  turned in the other direction.  We have losses at the moment.</p><p>In Asia, overnight it was mixed action.  The Shanghai composite the worst  performer there.  The Hang Seng managing to eke out a gain of half of one  percent.</p><p>Earnings season rolls on.  SeaWorld and Tyson among the names reporting  this morning.  What is driving stocks higher?  Coming up.  Try earnings  growth north of 24 percent.  That's much better than analysts expected to  start the reporting season.</p><p>A heroic rescue caught on camera.  Atlanta police pull a man out of a  burning car.  More of the unbelievable video later this hour.  Samsung set  to unveil its latest iPhone rival.  Images of the new device leaked,  Samsung is behind it.  And it's party time for one panda.  A zoo  celebrating the first birthday of its newest edition with a cake made of  bamboo and fruit.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning.  Maslansky and Partner  President Lee Carter, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and former CIA operative  and Diligence president, Mike Baker.  I had to cut you off because we're up  against a hard break.  But I agree that Conor McGregor it is the fight of - - maybe the century so far, coming up.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE:  Yes, actually -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it but they got to keep them from getting in trouble because  the issue you were talking about is he was -- he threw a hand truck and a  van full of fighters out at the bar at the Barclays Center out in Brooklyn,  and he ended up being on the legal trouble.</p><p>BAKER:  Yes, no, look, he is a beast but -- you know, you can do a little  home predictable so I think they're going to try to manage -- you know,  this is lead up to the fight because this, I had a massive fight, the  payday is huge.</p><p>If you're talking about China, it's true, quick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, please, quick.</p><p>BAKER:  I think, people need to watch what China is saying right now.   They're ratcheting up the rhetoric a little rhetoric a little bit, and it's  becoming more personal which is not typical for them.  So, I think what  we're seeing from that is their reaction to what's happening within their  own economy.</p><p>And this is a very interesting time, but also a very difficult time.  And  we need to manage this properly because again, and we talked about this  earlier, a destabilized Chinese economy is not going to do us any good in  the long run.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rhetoric that becomes increasingly personal against the  president.</p><p>BAKER:  Against the administration, against President Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because we know he has talked about Xi Jinping, his friend.  But  -- </p><p>BAKER:  Who is president for life basically now?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, but -- you know, you start making it personal with  President Trump and things generally don't go well.  So -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Yes, but that thing said,  people really think that the president is doing the right thing by fan of  China, they're still supporting this on both like on all sides.  To say  they expect them like two-thirds of Americans think this is the right  strategy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And my issue is and I've been very vocal about it.  In the  meantime, we've taken aback to our allies at the same time.  And in  Americans whose jobs are at risk or have been hurt by higher prices.</p><p>So, there you go.  Let's talk China going in on Trump's tariff threats,  saying, he's starring in his own, \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of  extortion and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president plans to stay the course on trade.  Let's go to Blake Burman  live in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey near where the president is taking a  working vacation.  Blake, what's the latest?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  As you guys were just talking about the Chinese ratcheting  up the rhetoric over the weekend.  The latest coming in a state-run  editorial of the -- that editorial described the president as engaging in  what they described as \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of extortion,  and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president though over the weekend saying that he gets along with the  Chinese.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Look, I don't blame China.   I don't blame any of these countries, I don't have to go through them I've  got some good relationships.  Believe it or not they all like me, they  understand.  They can't believe themselves they got away with it.  They  can't believe that they got away with, but they have and we're turning it  around, we're turning it around fast.</p><p>BURMAN:  Both sides appear to be dug in here, because the Chinese saying  that the U.S. and China right now are engaged in a quote, \"zero-sum\" game.   While members of the Trump administration continue to say that President  Trump will not blink.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR:  Don't underestimate  President Trump's resolve here.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:   How far are you prepared  to take those?</p><p>BOLTON:  Far enough to get China to change its behavior, and they need to  understand that.</p><p>WALLACE:  And, if they don't change their behavior?</p><p>BOLTON:  I think, the pressure will continue.  I think the president's made  that very clear.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURMAN:  The president, now unveiling a new argument over the weekend  Dagen, he tweeted out the following at one point, writing, \"Because of  tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21  trillion in debt that has been accumulated.  It's unclear though, Dagen, exactly how that specific math there checks  out?  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman for us in New Jersey.</p><p>BURMAN:  We got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now, Mark Penn, a former Clinton adviser Stagwell  Group president, author of the book Microtrends Squared.  Mark, I said  earlier as a person, I consider myself to be a fiscal conservative.  I  don't think, I've ever seen a Republican president in my lifetime brag  about tax increases because that's essentially what he was doing.  And it's  actually not the first time I've heard him say that at least, one of the  rallies recently.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISER OF BILL CLINTON:  Well, I think you have to look  at these tariffs as strategic bargaining chips.  I mean, I think, you know  what, I've seen President Trump do over and over again is when he doesn't  really have anything to bargain with, he creates things to bargain with.</p><p>And that's what I think what he's done with the tariffs.  And when it comes  to China, the public really does support him in China.  They think China  has been stealing American jobs for a long time, stealing American  technology, and is out for world economic domination on the back of  America.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, Mark, this is Lee Carter speaking.  I am -- I'm  fascinated by how Americans are reacting to all of this.  And really -- in  general saying that they support what the president is doing with China,  and believe exactly what you said that these are really strategic  bargaining chips that he's using with.  And think in a long-term, we're  going to win.</p><p>And we're seeing the president's approval ratings eke up.  On the other  hand, we're seeing independents starting to -- in the most recent polls we  thought were just talking about NBC poll that just came out saying that the  independents are actually softening towards the president.  What are you  seeing in your polls?</p><p>PENN:  Well, look, we had at the Harvard caps, Harris Poll.  We had the  president at about 45 percent approval.  We didn't really show dramatic  change.  I think to the extent, the president is sticking up it's because  of the economic straight.</p><p>70 percent of Americans now say that we have a strong economy, and that  really is the biggest change in the poll in the last year.</p><p>I think that's up about 15 points or so.  And that is the tremendous shift,  and that is what is holding him up because he's got a 55 percent approval  there.  On the other side, immigration -- you know, the tariffs, he could  have waited till after the midterms on the tariffs because it does create - - you know, some controversy particularly in terms of Europe and Mexico,  and but not China, they do support him on China.  And that's kind of what  we're saying.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, the other thing that I'm really, really interested in  when it comes to the -- comes to the polling is voter enthusiasm.  And as  we're going into the midterms, it's sort of been flip-flopping over who's  more enthusiastic, Democrats or Republicans?</p><p>And as we're looking at the war on the media or the media -- you know, back  and forth between the president, and it seems like the war on what's  happening with the media, and the media attacking the president all the  time, did he energizing Republicans more?  What do you see?</p><p>PENN:  Yes, I think everybody is going to be energized.  I am going to be  fascinating, we're going to be fascinated about what happens on Tuesday  night here in this -- in this special election in a Republican district in  Ohio.</p><p>I -- look, I think that the president has made the choice here energize his  base.  Go out and rally after rally, and do what worked for him in the  presidential.</p><p>A little risky because the question is, \"Are independent women in suburban  districts who have voted more Republican than anybody realizes going to  drift Democratic?  And that's really the big question.  And the more he  plays to the base, to the working class that doesn't typically show out,  the show up in midterms, the more he may lose some of the well-educated  suburban voters who typically do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, Mark, I will say this, and we saw it in 2016.  Women,  wives, mothers vote on the economy.  This economy is growing at the fastest  pace in four years north of four percent it could grow even faster in the  current quarter based on the most recent estimates.</p><p>Job growth on average this year is faster than it was last year at this  time which is incredible for an economy into nine years of an expansion.   Wages are growing at the fastest pace in a decade.  And then, you have good  news even on Obamacare in premiums aren't going up as much as people  expected.  They're actually falling according to reports to some of these  state insurance commissioners.</p><p>I think that it's hard to find anything wrong.  This is -- and look at  this, the USDA showed that nearly 3 million Americans have come off of food  stamps since President took office.  Again, that's what women vote on.</p><p>PENN:  Well, and of course, if I were working with President Clinton, and  we had numbers like that, his ratings would be in the stratosphere and he'd  be untouchable.  So, the fact that's not the case shows you that, that  message hasn't gotten through yet. </p><p>Certainly, the idea that 3 million are off food stamps hasn't gotten  through.  It's an important message because the big question here with the  tax cuts is, \"Did it just benefit the big corporations or did the working  class and even the working poor benefit?  And truth is that you say a lot  of statistics are coming out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you need the message?  Do you need the messages, though?  90  percent of Americans got a pay hike because of the tax cuts earlier this  year.  90 percent of people are seeing fatter paychecks.  Do you need to  message that?</p><p>Do -- there -- again, it kind of comes back to do his approval ratings and  do the polls even matter because they sure as heck didn't matter going into  the election almost two years ago?</p><p>PENN:  Well, but the public is fed up, the Congress doesn't seem to be able  to do anything.  I do think the Republicans have a leader who has quit,  doesn't even support the President on tariffs.  And yet, is staying in  office.  I've said consistently with you that I think the biggest  Republican weakness is they have no message and the leadership.</p><p>The Democrats have weaknesses too.  You know, headed by Pelosi, someone  who's really disliked throughout the country and featuring socialist.   That's why a voter who is going to go into the polls who's not energized in  the middle is truly confused about which way to vote.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you said, Nancy Pelosi, let's also talk about Senator  Elizabeth Warren, which she was fueling rumors of a presidential run over  the week and saying, she well -- you can just listen to this, she's not  afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE:  It won't be  easy.  We're going to have to fight uphill.  But me, I'm going up that hill  and I hope you are too.  And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your  hand out and bring someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In terms of policy platform, it's abortion and open borders.  I  don't know how that wins.</p><p>PENN:  Well, if you look at the Democrats in the Democratic primary,  actually, Biden has been rising and not Elizabeth Warren.  Elizabeth Warren  gets all the publicity, but he went out -- you know, this week with  President Obama.</p><p>You know, I think begin -- he has been very quietly position himself.   Look, I don't think Elizabeth Warren would be the best Democratic  presidential candidate.  And -- you know, the Pelosi Warren team is really  too far to the left for America.</p><p>But I don't think that's where the rank-and-file Democrats are, and I don't  think that's how this is going to play out come three years from now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe Biden taking a selfie with President Obama with a big grin  on his face.  Well, I think that every American could write the caption for  that.  Mark Penn, thank you so much.</p><p>PENN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you my friend, Mark Penn.  Coming up, an  unbelievable rescue.  Police in Atlanta pull a man out of a burning car.   Details on the heroic action straight ahead.  And Samsung unveiling its  newest phone this week.  The detail is already out because Samsung leaked  them.  That story later this hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A Philadelphia Police Officer is in the hospital  after being shot in the face this morning.  Kristina Partsinevelos has the  details.  Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  The  officer was shot in the face while serving a warrant.  He is identified as  49-year-old Jason Potts.

And at the time that Pepsi is under pressure in terms of its  fizzy drinks business but also with these tariffs.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And took global business and just not operating and selling  your product to consumers and business in one country, selling around the  world and that's a challenging job by any stretch with tariffs, it's even  more complicated.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And trade spats that are --</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And currencies that are not moving in the direction people that  people thought they were moving, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  It's very difficult to plan your business that way but a  great run for a well-known woman at the top of one great American company.  </p><p>CARTER:  She is an extraordinary leader with an extraordinary vision.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You -- I want to give you a quiz.  I hate when people do this  but Pepsi was invented where?  Coke was invented in Atlanta.  Where was  Pepsi invented?  New Bern, North Carolina, Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>BAKER:  Oh, you think it was time to answer her.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he didn't know.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  OK.  I wrote it down right here, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  That's right.  Thank you so much.  Coming up.  A whale  sized surprise.

Twitter apologizing after it  suspended conservative commentator Candace Owens for response to a set of  anti-white tweets by New York Times editorial board member.  This is a new  higher.  This as reports indicate executives and top board members from the  social media giant have donated overwhelmingly to Democrats.</p><p>Lee, your reaction to this.  Candace Owens basically took anti-white tweets  from this new hire by the New York Times and replaced certain her words in  as -- to illustrate the insanity and hideousness of what this woman at The  New York Times had been tweeting.  That woman said that it was -- I guess  she was trying to illustrate irony or something like that.  Nevertheless,  your reaction.  </p><p>CARTER:  So my reaction is A, she should not have been suspended, B, I can  understand from a machine learning perspective how this could have been  taken down as hate speech.  But what I don't understand is why it just  would have been blocked like so many other things or rather than saying  that we're going to suspend her.  And thirdly, I really think that if this  is going to be the policy of a social media company like Twitter they need  to be able to respond more quickly.</p><p>To have this happen for 12 hours, to go with no response, to go and say  nothing for a long time is a real problem for them and when I think that  Twitter really needs to remember is that, there is a huge number of  conservatives between ages 27 and 32.  In fact there was more conservatives  than there are liberals.  So they better do something about this.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's become -- Mike, how do you feel of about this?  Because I  have noticed and I mentioned with Jessica Tarlov that conservatives have  put in a bright red X next to their names to push back on Twitter, their  way of expressing dissatisfaction with the shadow banning that we've been  going on like where in search results, conservative names are essentially  buried or don't even show up at all.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Look, I'm shocked that Twitter leadership overwhelmingly  supports Democrats.  I picked up the New York Times, I know I'm reading a  paper with a certain lean, right?  I pick up the Wall Street Journal same  way.  You know, it's the world we live in.  I get on Twitter, I know where  they're going, right?  I know what their agenda in a sense is, and so I'm  not surprised.</p><p>And -- I guess bigger issue for me is just we -- where is the civility in  any of the dialogue whether it's on social media or face to face or on, you  know, traditional media.  We seem to have lost the inability, right?  To  speak rationally speak to people having a different point of view.  We've  lost our --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here are the two things -- the most hideous things that have  been said to me on Twitter by people on left, they need to reopen Auschwitz  to gas and incinerate you and I can't wait until Iran wipes Israel off the  map so I can watch you cry.  These people were not disciplined by Twitter,  they shouldn't have accounts, should they?</p><p>It's a private organization, they should -- but again, the level of hate --  and these are people, who -- go by their own names who were sitting at home  spewing this kind of hatred and if I -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BAKER:  But it's on both sides.  It's on both -- to be honest it's -- both  the hard sides, right?  Both the far right, the far left are sitting in  their trenches throwing hand grenades saying equally despicable things.   Nobody exists in the center anymore.  You don't have to agree with  somebody's position, right?  You don't have to read -- you're just fine.   But figure out a way to have a conversation without being -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, on the left anti-semitism is alive and well and I  don't even -- and they don't -- people, liberals don't acknowledge it, I  see it every day and I can say with no hesitation that the nastiest that  ever been said to me on social media were from the left.  People who preach  -- you know, 40 years ago preaching peace, love, and happiness.  Let's all  locked arms and we are against big government and helping one another.</p><p>Well, that just died.  I don't know when but it just died. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, no doubt about it.  I mean, Antifa, the big joke about  them is that they think they are, you know, this group that's out to, you  know, to promote free speech and yet they bludgeon anybody who doesn't  agree with them.  And they don't get the joke about that, they don't see  how ironic that is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And cowards wearing black masks, I should point that out.   Cowards wearing -- covering their faces.  </p><p>BAKER:  You're not a good look for them. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming.

Listen to this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p>TRUMP:  If I didn't do anything with the trade deals, if I said nothing,  we're going to let everybody continue to take our jobs, take our wealth,  let them continue -- you know, I bet our stock market is up almost 40  percent since I won.  But if I didn't do anything with trade, just kept  quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us.  Nobody says anything.  I  think you would've been up another 40, 50, 60 percent.  But eventually, you  would have had to pay the piper eventually, and we're not going to do.   We're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer  than it has ever been.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now: Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment  Institute Head Global Market Strategist.  Paul, why has the markets been  able to shake off the trade tensions, the trade worry so much?  </p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT  INSTITUTE:  Well, though, the market believes and we agree, that a deal is  the ultimate goal here that the goal is not to run the Chinese economy into  the ground or the U.S. economy into ground with unending tariffs.  They can  get a negotiation on the trade deficit, getting the Chinese to buy more  from this country, and if they can get a deal on autos with the Mexicans,  the Canadians, and the Europeans then we think the trade talk, the  rhetoric, dies down a bit or is dialed back.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC U.S.:  Hey, Paul, Mitch Roschelle.  You  mentioned China and their economy, some of the challenges that their  economy sort of predate the trade war, their markets are sort of in free- fall, their currency is diminishing, and they are growing middle class, and  the funding of entitlements for the middle class is really starting to put  pressure on their ability to grow and you see that in GDP numbers.  So,  regardless, don't we still have a global challenge that China's economy  that's going to impact other global economies if this trade war isn't  sorted out.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, you're absolutely right, Mitch, the moderation in  growth around the world, Europe I mention, too had slowed down some.  That  is confusing the markets a little bit here.  They're thinking that all of  the slowdown is related to trade talk.  It's not.  The slowdown is  predating the trade talk and it's an important factor.  The Chinese -- we  need to remember, the Chinese have an economy that on the one hand, has  very strong consumer growth, and on the other hand has a lot of debt.  And  as you mentioned, some issues with the providing social welfare.  So, how  are they going to balance that going forward?  They need to be very careful  with that and they don't need extra variable in there, if you will, of  trade uncertainty.  So, we think there's pressure on Chinese internally to  come to the negotiating table.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Debt is a huge issue, though, Paul.  And let's talk about what  we're paying as nation to borrow right now.  JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie  Dimon, warning investors over the weekend to prepare for five percent  interest rates -- that would be yield on the 10-year treasury.  And this  certainly is a major concern; it's not showing up in the markets so much at  this point, but now that back to running one trillion-dollar deficits,  we're in a fight with one of the largest holders of our own debt.  Someone  we've leaned on China and relied upon to buy our debt and fund deficit.   Your reaction to this?  Is there any way in the near-term that we even get  back to four percent on the 10-year yield?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  We don't think that there's much chance of getting to back to  four percent any time soon.  On the 10-year yield, yes, the debt is a  weight on the economy, call it a headwind for growth.  And no, we don't  think the Chinese are about ready to dump their holdings of U.S.  Treasuries.  Treasuries are simply the largest, the most liquid market in  the world.  And if you're a government that needs to hold trillions of  dollars of reserves, there's no other place for you to go but to hold U.S.  Treasury. </p><p>So, we don't think there's a real threat there.  But yes, the debt is going  to be a headwind for the economy going forward.  On the other hand, you've  got, still, quite a demographic challenge going forward as many of us age  and get into the retirement years.  We're going to be holding a lot more  debt anyway, that's going to help keep yield a little lower.  Our target  for 10-year treasury of this year is in the low threes, and we don't see it  moving up to four any time soon -- rather low yields look to us to be  continue to be the main problem for investors.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, is an aging population and those who will be holding more  safe, if you will, treasuries, is that bad for the stock market then?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, what it does for the stock market when the yields are  low, relatively low on treasury, we've been hanging around three percent  here.  That means that you can have a little bit higher stock market  prices, before stocks get overvalued.  So, we don't think that stocks are  too rich right now, and part of that argument is that the 10-year is just  not making the sort of headway that would get you to four or five percent.   If we were to see that, we'd be more worried about stocks.  </p><p>BAKER:  Paul, going book to -- sorry, Mike Baker, here, going back to  tariffs question: There's a bit of a -- softening in the talk between U.S.  administration, and the E.U. now, and tariffs skirmish.  Do you expect the  same development in our conversations with China?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the I think Chinese know that there's a deal available  for them any time they want to take it.  But they're just not sure whether,  whether they should go now or later.  We think there will be a deal  sometime.  There's a good window for that opening up in the fall.  But the  Chinese simply need to figure out a way to close that -- some of that trade  deficit.  They could buy more liquid natural gas, they could buy more crude  oil, they could buy more soybeans.  Certainly, they need all of those  things in greater quantities than before.  </p><p>And I think if they were to do that, they would make -- they would come a  long way towards meeting the president in a deal.  So, I think that's, in  the end, where they'll finally go is making some kind of deal on trade.   The U.S. and the Europeans also have talking to do, not a done deal yet  there either.  But, again, the president probably wants to see those two  things, some sort of deal on autos and some sort of deal with the Chinese  on the trade deficit.  And then we think that the trade negotiations seem  to a lower priority and for the markets and we can get back to thinking  about good earnings growth going forward. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul, real quick, why is the opening in terms of having  discussions with China, why is that in the fall what about the timing of  that?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, the -- you've got midterm elections coming up here --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  -- In U.S.  And the president is still putting out their  additional tariffs and the Chinese feel obliged to respond.  I think  they're still gauging each other's degree of seriousness that the president  in our view, since the beginning, has been serious.  But some people maybe  have been thinking that, well, he would be eventually bend or making  exceptions.  That's not been the case.  So, they need to get back talking  again.  There's some evidence that the Chinese are interested in that.  It  just has to happen sometime in the next few months, we thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the stock market just keeps chugging along.  Paul  Christopher, thank you so much.  Take care.    </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up, incredible rescue caught on tape.

But Tyson Foods and Sea World have reported this morning.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more, Nicole. </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  So, there's been a lot of optimism surrounding the earnings 24.2  percent gain for earnings overall, year-over-year growth.  So, that's  surpassing analysts' estimates in 43 companies this week.  Take a look at  two that have already kicked it out: Tyson Foods and Sea World.  Sea World  up 15 percent; Tyson Food up three percent, this morning.  So, Tyson Foods  CEO, we did see that Tyson Foods -- this was a beat on profit.  Also, the  cattle prices have been falling; the food prices have been falling, and  they've increased herd size, and size of the heavier animals.  That offset  the impact of falling bacon pork prices.  This is apparent of Ball Park  Frank's hot dogs and Jimmy Dean's sausages.  </p><p>And then, there's Sea World.  What the CEO is saying that the quarter  benefitted from new marketing initiatives, strategic pricing, positive  reception to rises and such, the attendance on rise, and it was the revenue  that wowed Wall Street.  In fact, this is the third time in a row, third  straight, beat on top lines.  So, this is a winner, no doubt, for Sea  World.  And you could see it is up 15 percent.  That's going to be heavily  traded in a big mover today.  </p><p>Just as far as market commentary, Jeff Saut over at Raymond James,  everybody's been somewhat concerned about the sector rotation out of tech - - out of tech and out of consumer cyclicals, and have they moved into cash?   No, in fact, they've moving been moving it into industrials and financials,  and some other consumer non-cyclicals.  And he said, this sector rotation  is healthy, it's associated with a healthy bull market.  They're also a  little positive on Apple, and little weak on CBS this morning.  Back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Apple, the first to cross the finish line to  $1 trillion in its valuation.  Several other big tech names are close  behind.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  You  have a prediction, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, wait a minute, wait a  minute, wait a minute.  I just want to take our audience back to the Fox  News Channel on Friday afternoon where you made a stellar appearance on  \"THE FIVE,\" as I recall.  I thought you were really, really cool.  And it  occurred to me, you and I go back about 10 years now, working together in  the Fox Business Network for about 10 years.  What's the biggest story that  you and I have covered in those 10 years?  Don't answer, I think -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love you.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think it is the extraordinary performance and the gain in  valuation of those five big technology companies.  Apple is already worth a  trillion.  You've got Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really close, well  above 800 billion, and Facebook is down there at 500 billion.  But  essentially, I've never seen anything like this before.  You've never seen  the accumulation of wealth and power as we have seen in the last couple of  years in those five american technology companies.  There's going to be  cause to break them up, but nonetheless, they are there, they're  exceptionally powerful.  I think it's a unique moment in our financial  history.  Amazon, Google, microsoft, you get a good rally this year, and  from where we are now, and all three of them will join Apple at a trillion- dollar valuation, extraordinary stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It really is important though, Stuart, that you highlight it in  the way that you do every day on your show, but in this -- in this moment  as well, and I said this because we very often -- you know, the news media  gets criticized so much, but many people are quite frankly lazy about it.   They don't have to do any homework, they can talk about President Trump and  his mental state.  But this is important to breathe and look at and  highlight because this is American greatness.</p><p>VARNEY:  And it doesn't get much coverage in the establishment newpapers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  They cover it in a negative way.  They've got too much power,  they've got too much wealth.  I cover it in a positive way.  All the money  they are making will flow out into different industries like cars, medical  devices, drugs, that -- money made out of computing power will flow out to  other industries and improve them.  I think it's very positive development.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And anybody in this country, if you own one share of an Apple or  a Microsoft or Amazon, or a Netflix, you're an owner in that company.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You own part of it and I think that that's worth -- that we're  all in it together.  We're all part of this greatness.</p><p>VARNEY:  Anybody with a 401(k), an IRA, a mutual fund, you benefited from  this, you've seen your retirement savings go up, and that is wholly good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen and hallelujah.</p><p>VARNEY:  There's a mutual adoration society here, Dagen, I kind of like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And thank you for the kind words.</p><p>VARNEY:  You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's why we like working here because these are the people we  work with and we actually like each other off in here, and not faking it --  we're not faking it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Incredible.</p><p>BAKER:  And Stuart --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, we got to go.</p><p>BAKER:  Oh, we got to go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love you, Mike.  That's Mike Baker.</p><p>VARNEY:  OK, Mike, love you, too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAKER:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A reminder, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m.  Eastern.

We'll be back here with you guys in a  couple of weeks and we'll be looking forward to talking about what it looks  like on the ground there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are they going to give, are they going to step up and let us  actually negotiate different trade deals, Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The thing that concerns me is growing national debt.  We have  over $700 billion being refinanced of the next two quarters and that really  concerns me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Federal Reserve is pulling back on its balance sheet at the  same time and we're running $1-trillion budget.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is going to be a trillion-dollar deficit this year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lee?</p><p>CARTER:  A lot of criticisms about the polls, and whether or not they're  reliable.  I think what's important to look at the polls for is for  momentum and direction, and it looks like the President has weathered a  really tough storm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed, Lee Carter, Mitch Roschelle, and Mike Baker.  Thanks to  one and all, travel safely, we will see you tomorrer (ph) -- excuse me --  tomorrow.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts right now.  Stuart, it is all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it is, Dagen, good morning to you, thank you very much,  indeed.  And good morning, everyone.  Investors, how is this to start the  week, profit season in full swing, and big companies, their profit is  surging.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tough talk on trade. China firing back against President Trump. The state media blasting the administration, saying extortion won't work. The President Trump, doubling down on his policies over the weekend at a rally in Ohio.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Checking the markets, let's check. You know what is going for President Trump? His rhetoric on trade it's working, he has his base fired up Lee Carter is going to talk about that, coming up. And also, this economy, it's in Fuego. And the futures are showing that this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have gained across the board. This coming off the fifth week in a row that the Dow and S&amp;P have been up, and the real winner has been the NASDAQ in terms of top performance. It was up nearly one percent on the week. Apple, hitting a $1 trillion market cap. The first U.S. company to ever do that.</p><p>All of this in terms of wages growing at the fastest pace in 10 years. Inflation still tame, you name it. It's going well for the United States of America. In Europe, we have gains across the board to tell you about. And England, France, and Germany, no we don't, the markets have completely turned in the other direction. We have losses at the moment.</p><p>In Asia, overnight it was mixed action. The Shanghai composite the worst performer there. The Hang Seng managing to eke out a gain of half of one percent.</p><p>Earnings season rolls on. SeaWorld and Tyson among the names reporting this morning. What is driving stocks higher? Coming up. Try earnings growth north of 24 percent. That's much better than analysts expected to start the reporting season.</p><p>A heroic rescue caught on camera. Atlanta police pull a man out of a burning car. More of the unbelievable video later this hour. Samsung set to unveil its latest iPhone rival. Images of the new device leaked, Samsung is behind it. And it's party time for one panda. A zoo celebrating the first birthday of its newest edition with a cake made of bamboo and fruit.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning. Maslansky and Partner President Lee Carter, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle, and former CIA operative and Diligence president, Mike Baker. I had to cut you off because we're up against a hard break. But I agree that Conor McGregor it is the fight of - - maybe the century so far, coming up.</p><p>MIKE BAKER, PRESIDENT, DILIGENCE: Yes, actually --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it but they got to keep them from getting in trouble because the issue you were talking about is he was -- he threw a hand truck and a van full of fighters out at the bar at the Barclays Center out in Brooklyn, and he ended up being on the legal trouble.</p><p>BAKER: Yes, no, look, he is a beast but -- you know, you can do a little home predictable so I think they're going to try to manage -- you know, this is lead up to the fight because this, I had a massive fight, the payday is huge.</p><p>If you're talking about China, it's true, quick.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, please, quick.</p><p>BAKER: I think, people need to watch what China is saying right now. They're ratcheting up the rhetoric a little rhetoric a little bit, and it's becoming more personal which is not typical for them. So, I think what we're seeing from that is their reaction to what's happening within their own economy.</p><p>And this is a very interesting time, but also a very difficult time. And we need to manage this properly because again, and we talked about this earlier, a destabilized Chinese economy is not going to do us any good in the long run.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rhetoric that becomes increasingly personal against the president.</p><p>BAKER: Against the administration, against President Trump.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because we know he has talked about Xi Jinping, his friend. But --</p><p>BAKER: Who is president for life basically now?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, but -- you know, you start making it personal with President Trump and things generally don't go well. So --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Yes, but that thing said, people really think that the president is doing the right thing by fan of China, they're still supporting this on both like on all sides. To say they expect them like two-thirds of Americans think this is the right strategy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And my issue is and I've been very vocal about it. In the meantime, we've taken aback to our allies at the same time. And in Americans whose jobs are at risk or have been hurt by higher prices.</p><p>So, there you go. Let's talk China going in on Trump's tariff threats, saying, he's starring in his own, \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president plans to stay the course on trade. Let's go to Blake Burman live in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey near where the president is taking a working vacation. Blake, what's the latest?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Dagen. Good morning to you. As you guys were just talking about the Chinese ratcheting up the rhetoric over the weekend. The latest coming in a state-run editorial of the -- that editorial described the president as engaging in what they described as \"Streetfighter style, deceitful drama of extortion, and intimidation.\"</p><p>The president though over the weekend saying that he gets along with the Chinese.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Look, I don't blame China. I don't blame any of these countries, I don't have to go through them I've got some good relationships. Believe it or not they all like me, they understand. They can't believe themselves they got away with it. They can't believe that they got away with, but they have and we're turning it around, we're turning it around fast.</p><p>BURMAN: Both sides appear to be dug in here, because the Chinese saying that the U.S. and China right now are engaged in a quote, \"zero-sum\" game. While members of the Trump administration continue to say that President Trump will not blink.</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: Don't underestimate President Trump's resolve here.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: How far are you prepared to take those?</p><p>BOLTON: Far enough to get China to change its behavior, and they need to understand that.</p><p>WALLACE: And, if they don't change their behavior?</p><p>BOLTON: I think, the pressure will continue. I think the president's made that very clear.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURMAN: The president, now unveiling a new argument over the weekend Dagen, he tweeted out the following at one point, writing, \"Because of tariffs, we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 trillion in debt that has been accumulated. It's unclear though, Dagen, exactly how that specific math there checks out? Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Blake. Blake Burman for us in New Jersey.</p><p>BURMAN: We got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us now, Mark Penn, a former Clinton adviser Stagwell Group president, author of the book Microtrends Squared. Mark, I said earlier as a person, I consider myself to be a fiscal conservative. I don't think, I've ever seen a Republican president in my lifetime brag about tax increases because that's essentially what he was doing. And it's actually not the first time I've heard him say that at least, one of the rallies recently.</p><p>MARK PENN, FORMER ADVISER OF BILL CLINTON: Well, I think you have to look at these tariffs as strategic bargaining chips. I mean, I think, you know what, I've seen President Trump do over and over again is when he doesn't really have anything to bargain with, he creates things to bargain with.</p><p>And that's what I think what he's done with the tariffs. And when it comes to China, the public really does support him in China. They think China has been stealing American jobs for a long time, stealing American technology, and is out for world economic domination on the back of America.</p><p>CARTER: You know, Mark, this is Lee Carter speaking. I am -- I'm fascinated by how Americans are reacting to all of this. And really -- in general saying that they support what the president is doing with China, and believe exactly what you said that these are really strategic bargaining chips that he's using with. And think in a long-term, we're going to win.</p><p>And we're seeing the president's approval ratings eke up. On the other hand, we're seeing independents starting to -- in the most recent polls we thought were just talking about NBC poll that just came out saying that the independents are actually softening towards the president. What are you seeing in your polls?</p><p>PENN: Well, look, we had at the Harvard caps, Harris Poll. We had the president at about 45 percent approval. We didn't really show dramatic change. I think to the extent, the president is sticking up it's because of the economic straight.</p><p>70 percent of Americans now say that we have a strong economy, and that really is the biggest change in the poll in the last year.</p><p>I think that's up about 15 points or so. And that is the tremendous shift, and that is what is holding him up because he's got a 55 percent approval there. On the other side, immigration -- you know, the tariffs, he could have waited till after the midterms on the tariffs because it does create - - you know, some controversy particularly in terms of Europe and Mexico, and but not China, they do support him on China. And that's kind of what we're saying.</p><p>CARTER: You know, the other thing that I'm really, really interested in when it comes to the -- comes to the polling is voter enthusiasm. And as we're going into the midterms, it's sort of been flip-flopping over who's more enthusiastic, Democrats or Republicans?</p><p>And as we're looking at the war on the media or the media -- you know, back and forth between the president, and it seems like the war on what's happening with the media, and the media attacking the president all the time, did he energizing Republicans more? What do you see?</p><p>PENN: Yes, I think everybody is going to be energized. I am going to be fascinating, we're going to be fascinated about what happens on Tuesday night here in this -- in this special election in a Republican district in Ohio.</p><p>I -- look, I think that the president has made the choice here energize his base. Go out and rally after rally, and do what worked for him in the presidential.</p><p>A little risky because the question is, \"Are independent women in suburban districts who have voted more Republican than anybody realizes going to drift Democratic? And that's really the big question. And the more he plays to the base, to the working class that doesn't typically show out, the show up in midterms, the more he may lose some of the well-educated suburban voters who typically do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, Mark, I will say this, and we saw it in 2016. Women, wives, mothers vote on the economy. This economy is growing at the fastest pace in four years north of four percent it could grow even faster in the current quarter based on the most recent estimates.</p><p>Job growth on average this year is faster than it was last year at this time which is incredible for an economy into nine years of an expansion. Wages are growing at the fastest pace in a decade. And then, you have good news even on Obamacare in premiums aren't going up as much as people expected. They're actually falling according to reports to some of these state insurance commissioners.</p><p>I think that it's hard to find anything wrong. This is -- and look at this, the USDA showed that nearly 3 million Americans have come off of food stamps since President took office. Again, that's what women vote on.</p><p>PENN: Well, and of course, if I were working with President Clinton, and we had numbers like that, his ratings would be in the stratosphere and he'd be untouchable. So, the fact that's not the case shows you that, that message hasn't gotten through yet.</p><p>Certainly, the idea that 3 million are off food stamps hasn't gotten through. It's an important message because the big question here with the tax cuts is, \"Did it just benefit the big corporations or did the working class and even the working poor benefit? And truth is that you say a lot of statistics are coming out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you need the message? Do you need the messages, though? 90 percent of Americans got a pay hike because of the tax cuts earlier this year. 90 percent of people are seeing fatter paychecks. Do you need to message that?</p><p>Do -- there -- again, it kind of comes back to do his approval ratings and do the polls even matter because they sure as heck didn't matter going into the election almost two years ago?</p><p>PENN: Well, but the public is fed up, the Congress doesn't seem to be able to do anything. I do think the Republicans have a leader who has quit, doesn't even support the President on tariffs. And yet, is staying in office. I've said consistently with you that I think the biggest Republican weakness is they have no message and the leadership.</p><p>The Democrats have weaknesses too. You know, headed by Pelosi, someone who's really disliked throughout the country and featuring socialist. That's why a voter who is going to go into the polls who's not energized in the middle is truly confused about which way to vote.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you said, Nancy Pelosi, let's also talk about Senator Elizabeth Warren, which she was fueling rumors of a presidential run over the week and saying, she well -- you can just listen to this, she's not afraid to be the underdog.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: It won't be easy. We're going to have to fight uphill. But me, I'm going up that hill and I hope you are too. And I hope that when you do, you'll reach your hand out and bring someone else along for the climb.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: In terms of policy platform, it's abortion and open borders. I don't know how that wins.</p><p>PENN: Well, if you look at the Democrats in the Democratic primary, actually, Biden has been rising and not Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren gets all the publicity, but he went out -- you know, this week with President Obama.</p><p>You know, I think begin -- he has been very quietly position himself. Look, I don't think Elizabeth Warren would be the best Democratic presidential candidate. And -- you know, the Pelosi Warren team is really too far to the left for America.</p><p>But I don't think that's where the rank-and-file Democrats are, and I don't think that's how this is going to play out come three years from now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joe Biden taking a selfie with President Obama with a big grin on his face. Well, I think that every American could write the caption for that. Mark Penn, thank you so much.</p><p>PENN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you my friend, Mark Penn. Coming up, an unbelievable rescue. Police in Atlanta pull a man out of a burning car. Details on the heroic action straight ahead. And Samsung unveiling its newest phone this week. The detail is already out because Samsung leaked them. That story later this hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news. A Philadelphia Police Officer is in the hospital after being shot in the face this morning. Kristina Partsinevelos has the details. Kristina?</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. The officer was shot in the face while serving a warrant. He is identified as 49-year-old Jason Potts. A 20-year veteran of the force and a member of the SWAT team. Officer Potts suffered heavy bleeding and at least a broken jaw. Police say he is expected to survive though.</p><p>Tourists are fleeing after a powerful earthquake in Indonesia. Magnitude 7.0 quake hitting the tourist island of Lombok killing about 100 people. More than 230 others seriously injured. The death toll is expected to rise and search operations continue. It's the second deadly -- deadliest quack in just one week to hit that island. A July 29th quake killed 16 people and damaged hundreds of homes.</p><p>And there is more trouble at Wells Fargo. The bank said the calculation error may have caused hundreds of people to lose their homes to foreclosure between 2010 and 2015. According to a regulatory filing, Wells Fargo said the mistake was made in a formula used to qualify struggling homeowners for Federally-backed assistance programs. The bank has set aside $8 million or about $20,000 per affected customer.</p><p>Shares of Wells Fargo are down three percent today but up this morning. And PepsiCo CEO announcing plans to step down after leading the company for 12 years. Indra Nooyi will leave in October and she will be succeeded by Ramon Laguarta. Nooyi, a 24-year old veteran at PepsiCo will remain chairman at the board until early next year. Shares of PepsiCo slightly in premarket trading. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Kristina. Extremely tough job, Mitch Roschelle. And at the time that Pepsi is under pressure in terms of its fizzy drinks business but also with these tariffs.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And took global business and just not operating and selling your product to consumers and business in one country, selling around the world and that's a challenging job by any stretch with tariffs, it's even more complicated.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And trade spats that are --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And currencies that are not moving in the direction people that people thought they were moving, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. It's very difficult to plan your business that way but a great run for a well-known woman at the top of one great American company.</p><p>CARTER: She is an extraordinary leader with an extraordinary vision.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You -- I want to give you a quiz. I hate when people do this but Pepsi was invented where? Coke was invented in Atlanta. Where was Pepsi invented? New Bern, North Carolina, Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>BAKER: Oh, you think it was time to answer her.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he didn't know.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: OK. I wrote it down right here, New Bern, North Carolina.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. That's right. Thank you so much. Coming up. A whale sized surprise. Seaworld reporting better-than-expected sales. The stock jumping on the news. A closer look at what people back to the park straight ahead. Plus, a birthday bash fit for a giant panda. A zoo celebrates its newest bear cub with a cake of bamboo and fruit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Social media gets political again. Twitter apologizing after it suspended conservative commentator Candace Owens for response to a set of anti-white tweets by New York Times editorial board member. This is a new higher. This as reports indicate executives and top board members from the social media giant have donated overwhelmingly to Democrats.</p><p>Lee, your reaction to this. Candace Owens basically took anti-white tweets from this new hire by the New York Times and replaced certain her words in as -- to illustrate the insanity and hideousness of what this woman at The New York Times had been tweeting. That woman said that it was -- I guess she was trying to illustrate irony or something like that. Nevertheless, your reaction.</p><p>CARTER: So my reaction is A, she should not have been suspended, B, I can understand from a machine learning perspective how this could have been taken down as hate speech. But what I don't understand is why it just would have been blocked like so many other things or rather than saying that we're going to suspend her. And thirdly, I really think that if this is going to be the policy of a social media company like Twitter they need to be able to respond more quickly.</p><p>To have this happen for 12 hours, to go with no response, to go and say nothing for a long time is a real problem for them and when I think that Twitter really needs to remember is that, there is a huge number of conservatives between ages 27 and 32. In fact there was more conservatives than there are liberals. So they better do something about this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's become -- Mike, how do you feel of about this? Because I have noticed and I mentioned with Jessica Tarlov that conservatives have put in a bright red X next to their names to push back on Twitter, their way of expressing dissatisfaction with the shadow banning that we've been going on like where in search results, conservative names are essentially buried or don't even show up at all.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. Look, I'm shocked that Twitter leadership overwhelmingly supports Democrats. I picked up the New York Times, I know I'm reading a paper with a certain lean, right? I pick up the Wall Street Journal same way. You know, it's the world we live in. I get on Twitter, I know where they're going, right? I know what their agenda in a sense is, and so I'm not surprised.</p><p>And -- I guess bigger issue for me is just we -- where is the civility in any of the dialogue whether it's on social media or face to face or on, you know, traditional media. We seem to have lost the inability, right? To speak rationally speak to people having a different point of view. We've lost our --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here are the two things -- the most hideous things that have been said to me on Twitter by people on left, they need to reopen Auschwitz to gas and incinerate you and I can't wait until Iran wipes Israel off the map so I can watch you cry. These people were not disciplined by Twitter, they shouldn't have accounts, should they?</p><p>It's a private organization, they should -- but again, the level of hate -- and these are people, who -- go by their own names who were sitting at home spewing this kind of hatred and if I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER: But it's on both sides. It's on both -- to be honest it's -- both the hard sides, right? Both the far right, the far left are sitting in their trenches throwing hand grenades saying equally despicable things. Nobody exists in the center anymore. You don't have to agree with somebody's position, right? You don't have to read -- you're just fine. But figure out a way to have a conversation without being --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, on the left anti-semitism is alive and well and I don't even -- and they don't -- people, liberals don't acknowledge it, I see it every day and I can say with no hesitation that the nastiest that ever been said to me on social media were from the left. People who preach -- you know, 40 years ago preaching peace, love, and happiness. Let's all locked arms and we are against big government and helping one another.</p><p>Well, that just died. I don't know when but it just died.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Well, no doubt about it. I mean, Antifa, the big joke about them is that they think they are, you know, this group that's out to, you know, to promote free speech and yet they bludgeon anybody who doesn't agree with them. And they don't get the joke about that, they don't see how ironic that is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And cowards wearing black masks, I should point that out. Cowards wearing -- covering their faces.</p><p>BAKER: You're not a good look for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming. A massive pile up twisted steel and metal left behind after freight train derails in Pittsburgh. The latest on the investigation into that crash. Plus, Samsung's new Galaxy Note 9 details leaked from Samsung. We will tell you what happened.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, August 6th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. China state media attacks President Trump, over his proposed tariffs. Look out a state-run paper calling the tariffs extortion saying that president is starring in his own street fighter style defeatful drama. President Trump says that the tariffs are all about getting America on track.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: But America's economic surrender ended the day that I took office, folks. Now after years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike Baker said look out because China is getting all the more personal, and when people make personal attacks on President Trump -- we've kind of seen that movie before, we know what happens to them.</p><p>Futures are showing a flat market at the start of trading to start this new week. We have some slight gains on the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ 100 futures. But last week, the Dow and S&amp;P up for their fifth week in a row. The NASDAQ, bright shining star is well up more than one percent.</p><p>In Europe, we've been watching markets. We've been touting between green and red gains, now some losses across the board in England, France, and Germany, although slight loses. In Asia overnight, the market's mostly lower as well. The Seoul winner, with the Hang Seng up half of one percent.</p><p>And explosion near an airport in Italy. Police are tweeting that it was caused by an accident on a highway. We'll bring you the latest from Italy. And a nightmare on the tracks. A Norfolk southern train derailed in Pittsburgh yesterday. We bring you the details from this tragedy. Hero caught on video. Body cam footage showing an Atlanta police officer making a daring rescue from a burning car.</p><p>And hold the phone. New details out from Samsung on their latest phone we will break it down. And unbearably cute, a panda in France, celebrates his first birthday. Complete with a cake. Made of fruit and bamboo. We will play panda videos and baby goat videos all day long.</p><p>To our top story this half hour. Markets shaking up trade tensions. President Trump using the stock market as a measure of who's winning the trade dispute, and indicating that U.S. has a clear lead over China. Listen to this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: If I didn't do anything with the trade deals, if I said nothing, we're going to let everybody continue to take our jobs, take our wealth, let them continue -- you know, I bet our stock market is up almost 40 percent since I won. But if I didn't do anything with trade, just kept quiet, let them continue to take advantage of us. Nobody says anything. I think you would've been up another 40, 50, 60 percent. But eventually, you would have had to pay the piper eventually, and we're not going to do. We're going to do something, we're going to make our country so much richer than it has ever been.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us now: Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo Investment Institute Head Global Market Strategist. Paul, why has the markets been able to shake off the trade tensions, the trade worry so much?</p><p>PAUL CHRISTOPHER, HEAD GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Well, though, the market believes and we agree, that a deal is the ultimate goal here that the goal is not to run the Chinese economy into the ground or the U.S. economy into ground with unending tariffs. They can get a negotiation on the trade deficit, getting the Chinese to buy more from this country, and if they can get a deal on autos with the Mexicans, the Canadians, and the Europeans then we think the trade talk, the rhetoric, dies down a bit or is dialed back.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC U.S.: Hey, Paul, Mitch Roschelle. You mentioned China and their economy, some of the challenges that their economy sort of predate the trade war, their markets are sort of in free- fall, their currency is diminishing, and they are growing middle class, and the funding of entitlements for the middle class is really starting to put pressure on their ability to grow and you see that in GDP numbers. So, regardless, don't we still have a global challenge that China's economy that's going to impact other global economies if this trade war isn't sorted out.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, you're absolutely right, Mitch, the moderation in growth around the world, Europe I mention, too had slowed down some. That is confusing the markets a little bit here. They're thinking that all of the slowdown is related to trade talk. It's not. The slowdown is predating the trade talk and it's an important factor. The Chinese -- we need to remember, the Chinese have an economy that on the one hand, has very strong consumer growth, and on the other hand has a lot of debt. And as you mentioned, some issues with the providing social welfare. So, how are they going to balance that going forward? They need to be very careful with that and they don't need extra variable in there, if you will, of trade uncertainty. So, we think there's pressure on Chinese internally to come to the negotiating table.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Debt is a huge issue, though, Paul. And let's talk about what we're paying as nation to borrow right now. JPMorgan Chase CEO, Jamie Dimon, warning investors over the weekend to prepare for five percent interest rates -- that would be yield on the 10-year treasury. And this certainly is a major concern; it's not showing up in the markets so much at this point, but now that back to running one trillion-dollar deficits, we're in a fight with one of the largest holders of our own debt. Someone we've leaned on China and relied upon to buy our debt and fund deficit. Your reaction to this? Is there any way in the near-term that we even get back to four percent on the 10-year yield?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: We don't think that there's much chance of getting to back to four percent any time soon. On the 10-year yield, yes, the debt is a weight on the economy, call it a headwind for growth. And no, we don't think the Chinese are about ready to dump their holdings of U.S. Treasuries. Treasuries are simply the largest, the most liquid market in the world. And if you're a government that needs to hold trillions of dollars of reserves, there's no other place for you to go but to hold U.S. Treasury.</p><p>So, we don't think there's a real threat there. But yes, the debt is going to be a headwind for the economy going forward. On the other hand, you've got, still, quite a demographic challenge going forward as many of us age and get into the retirement years. We're going to be holding a lot more debt anyway, that's going to help keep yield a little lower. Our target for 10-year treasury of this year is in the low threes, and we don't see it moving up to four any time soon -- rather low yields look to us to be continue to be the main problem for investors.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, is an aging population and those who will be holding more safe, if you will, treasuries, is that bad for the stock market then?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, what it does for the stock market when the yields are low, relatively low on treasury, we've been hanging around three percent here. That means that you can have a little bit higher stock market prices, before stocks get overvalued. So, we don't think that stocks are too rich right now, and part of that argument is that the 10-year is just not making the sort of headway that would get you to four or five percent. If we were to see that, we'd be more worried about stocks.</p><p>BAKER: Paul, going book to -- sorry, Mike Baker, here, going back to tariffs question: There's a bit of a -- softening in the talk between U.S. administration, and the E.U. now, and tariffs skirmish. Do you expect the same development in our conversations with China?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, the I think Chinese know that there's a deal available for them any time they want to take it. But they're just not sure whether, whether they should go now or later. We think there will be a deal sometime. There's a good window for that opening up in the fall. But the Chinese simply need to figure out a way to close that -- some of that trade deficit. They could buy more liquid natural gas, they could buy more crude oil, they could buy more soybeans. Certainly, they need all of those things in greater quantities than before.</p><p>And I think if they were to do that, they would make -- they would come a long way towards meeting the president in a deal. So, I think that's, in the end, where they'll finally go is making some kind of deal on trade. The U.S. and the Europeans also have talking to do, not a done deal yet there either. But, again, the president probably wants to see those two things, some sort of deal on autos and some sort of deal with the Chinese on the trade deficit. And then we think that the trade negotiations seem to a lower priority and for the markets and we can get back to thinking about good earnings growth going forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Paul, real quick, why is the opening in terms of having discussions with China, why is that in the fall what about the timing of that?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Well, the -- you've got midterm elections coming up here --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: -- In U.S. And the president is still putting out their additional tariffs and the Chinese feel obliged to respond. I think they're still gauging each other's degree of seriousness that the president in our view, since the beginning, has been serious. But some people maybe have been thinking that, well, he would be eventually bend or making exceptions. That's not been the case. So, they need to get back talking again. There's some evidence that the Chinese are interested in that. It just has to happen sometime in the next few months, we thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the stock market just keeps chugging along. Paul Christopher, thank you so much. Take care.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Come back soon. Coming up, incredible rescue caught on tape. A police officer in Atlanta pulls a man out of a burning car. You have to see more of this hero in action. Plus, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, all aiming to be the next to join Apple at a $1 trillion valuation. Stuart Varney makes a big prediction about those tech titans. Mitch Roschelle is going hmm, we all are. Mr. Varney is next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Second quarters earning season rolls on this week at a slower pace. But Tyson Foods and Sea World have reported this morning. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Monday morning, Dagen. So, there's been a lot of optimism surrounding the earnings 24.2 percent gain for earnings overall, year-over-year growth. So, that's surpassing analysts' estimates in 43 companies this week. Take a look at two that have already kicked it out: Tyson Foods and Sea World. Sea World up 15 percent; Tyson Food up three percent, this morning. So, Tyson Foods CEO, we did see that Tyson Foods -- this was a beat on profit. Also, the cattle prices have been falling; the food prices have been falling, and they've increased herd size, and size of the heavier animals. That offset the impact of falling bacon pork prices. This is apparent of Ball Park Frank's hot dogs and Jimmy Dean's sausages.</p><p>And then, there's Sea World. What the CEO is saying that the quarter benefitted from new marketing initiatives, strategic pricing, positive reception to rises and such, the attendance on rise, and it was the revenue that wowed Wall Street. In fact, this is the third time in a row, third straight, beat on top lines. So, this is a winner, no doubt, for Sea World. And you could see it is up 15 percent. That's going to be heavily traded in a big mover today.</p><p>Just as far as market commentary, Jeff Saut over at Raymond James, everybody's been somewhat concerned about the sector rotation out of tech - - out of tech and out of consumer cyclicals, and have they moved into cash? No, in fact, they've moving been moving it into industrials and financials, and some other consumer non-cyclicals. And he said, this sector rotation is healthy, it's associated with a healthy bull market. They're also a little positive on Apple, and little weak on CBS this morning. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Nicole. Apple, the first to cross the finish line to $1 trillion in its valuation. Several other big tech names are close behind. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney. You have a prediction, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I just want to take our audience back to the Fox News Channel on Friday afternoon where you made a stellar appearance on \"THE FIVE,\" as I recall. I thought you were really, really cool. And it occurred to me, you and I go back about 10 years now, working together in the Fox Business Network for about 10 years. What's the biggest story that you and I have covered in those 10 years? Don't answer, I think --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love you.</p><p>VARNEY: I think it is the extraordinary performance and the gain in valuation of those five big technology companies. Apple is already worth a trillion. You've got Google, Amazon, and Microsoft really close, well above 800 billion, and Facebook is down there at 500 billion. But essentially, I've never seen anything like this before. You've never seen the accumulation of wealth and power as we have seen in the last couple of years in those five american technology companies. There's going to be cause to break them up, but nonetheless, they are there, they're exceptionally powerful. I think it's a unique moment in our financial history. Amazon, Google, microsoft, you get a good rally this year, and from where we are now, and all three of them will join Apple at a trillion- dollar valuation, extraordinary stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It really is important though, Stuart, that you highlight it in the way that you do every day on your show, but in this -- in this moment as well, and I said this because we very often -- you know, the news media gets criticized so much, but many people are quite frankly lazy about it. They don't have to do any homework, they can talk about President Trump and his mental state. But this is important to breathe and look at and highlight because this is American greatness.</p><p>VARNEY: And it doesn't get much coverage in the establishment newpapers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>VARNEY: They cover it in a negative way. They've got too much power, they've got too much wealth. I cover it in a positive way. All the money they are making will flow out into different industries like cars, medical devices, drugs, that -- money made out of computing power will flow out to other industries and improve them. I think it's very positive development.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And anybody in this country, if you own one share of an Apple or a Microsoft or Amazon, or a Netflix, you're an owner in that company.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You own part of it and I think that that's worth -- that we're all in it together. We're all part of this greatness.</p><p>VARNEY: Anybody with a 401(k), an IRA, a mutual fund, you benefited from this, you've seen your retirement savings go up, and that is wholly good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Amen and hallelujah.</p><p>VARNEY: There's a mutual adoration society here, Dagen, I kind of like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And thank you for the kind words.</p><p>VARNEY: You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's why we like working here because these are the people we work with and we actually like each other off in here, and not faking it -- we're not faking it.</p><p>VARNEY: Incredible.</p><p>BAKER: And Stuart --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, we got to go.</p><p>BAKER: Oh, we got to go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love you, Mike. That's Mike Baker.</p><p>VARNEY: OK, Mike, love you, too.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BAKER: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A reminder, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts every day at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. He is coming up in almost 11 minutes. A birthday bash fit for a giant panda. A zoo celebrates its newest beer cub with a delicious treat for a party of one.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: -- tumbling down on a hill on to light rail tracks, so that's what you're seeing in the screen right now, the cars were carrying consumer products but just food and housewares. No injuries luckily have been reported, and an investigation into the derailment is underway. Train service, though, has been suspended in the area.</p><p>An Atlanta Police officer is being hailed a hero this morning after saving a passenger from a burning car last night, and it was all caught on his body camera. You can see the officer, he's about to run from the vehicle and is dousing with a fire extinguisher. Authorities say the car's engine went up in flames after the car hit a metal utility pole. Officials say three people were taken to a local hospital. Another officer suffered minor scrapes and bruises. What a video.</p><p>Samsung is out with a new sneak peek on its new Galaxy Note 9. The company unveiling this video for the smartphone in its YouTube channel. It all but confirms that the Note 9 will have the option for one terabyte of memory, a massive amount of storage for all those videos and pictures we take. The Note 9 will apparently also come with 512 gigabytes of built in memory and support for 512 gigabytes microsdcards, something not supported by the iPhone, so those are difference right there.</p><p>And we have to end the morning of the hour with a lovely video of a french baby panda which treated to a unique cake to celebrate its first birthday, bamboo, honey, and a variety of fruits went into the colorful cake. The young panda weighs about 60 pounds and probably packed a few more after his B-Day celebration.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was in France, so of course, they have a delicious cake.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Chocolate cake, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. We need to get your expertise on something when guns did the sports earlier, we had this video of a Mariners fan trying to catch a ball with a bowl of poutine and failing miserably.</p><p>CARTER: Oh, no, it's all over the floor. So shameful, shameful.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Please explain what poutine is.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Poutine is or just like greasy French fry's gravy and cheese curds. But the cheese curds, when you chew them, they have to be squeeky. And there's an area in Quebec, St. Albert or St. Albert that makes a lot of these cheese curds. They're very popular, you can get all kinds of topings on them, but the one you want to go for is the typical gravy fries and cheese curds. Super fatenning for you.</p><p>BAKER: But now, Canada is not claiming they invented cheese curds, are they?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: No, no, but we didn't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: I'm an American now but (INAUDIBLE) invented the poutine back in the late 1950s.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In a trucker.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: See, there's so much shared heritage and love of food between the Canadians and people in the United States.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Yes, exactly. That's why I'm here, too. We all get along.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, again, we're build -- we're building some bridges.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Yes. I believe that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tariffs be dammed. We're building culinary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- we're building culinary bridges.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BAKER: Over cheese kurds, yes.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Yes, exactly. Poutine, yes.</p><p>BAKER: Poutine. So, you heard it here. You heard it here. The U.S. and Canada should be allies. OK. Got it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you --</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: I'm glad I'm the expert.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, you're killing it today. (INAUDIBLE) the whole nine yards. Kristina Partsinevelos. Coming up, final thoughts from our all stars when we come back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We picked that song because it's one of Mike Baker's top favorite songs of all-time. Final thoughts from our all-stars. Go!</p><p>BAKER: Sure. I can confirm that in Boise, we do have the goats gone wild situation under control. It is now safe to go back to Boise, it won't be acoasted by roaming goats. That's all I got.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We rank guys -- no, you've got more. Give me something on China real quick.</p><p>BAKER: Heading there tomorrow. We'll be back here with you guys in a couple of weeks and we'll be looking forward to talking about what it looks like on the ground there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are they going to give, are they going to step up and let us actually negotiate different trade deals, Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The thing that concerns me is growing national debt. We have over $700 billion being refinanced of the next two quarters and that really concerns me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Federal Reserve is pulling back on its balance sheet at the same time and we're running $1-trillion budget.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: This is going to be a trillion-dollar deficit this year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee?</p><p>CARTER: A lot of criticisms about the polls, and whether or not they're reliable. I think what's important to look at the polls for is for momentum and direction, and it looks like the President has weathered a really tough storm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed, Lee Carter, Mitch Roschelle, and Mike Baker. Thanks to one and all, travel safely, we will see you tomorrer (ph) -- excuse me -- tomorrow. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts right now. Stuart, it is all yours.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, it is, Dagen, good morning to you, thank you very much, indeed. And good morning, everyone.

We have to acknowledge that they're a competitor that is willing to do things we're not... and who does not automatically go along with the structures we've built [in the last 70 years],\" Mr Rogers said.</p><p>\"I don't think any nation in the world can say right now that they are where they want to be [in terms of their cyber defences].</p><p>\"Australia has just developed and released a cyber security strategy... and we have to give that time to play out, but all of us need to ask ourselves what we need to be doing differently... We can't keep doing the same thing but expect different results.\"</p><p>Before releasing its cyber strategy Prime Minister Scott Morrison had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/surge-in-cyber-attacks-amid-china-tensions-20200619-p554av\">made a rare declaration</url> that the country was suffering persistent cyber attacks from a \"sophisticated state-based actor,\" which was understood to mean China.</p><p>The government said the number of attacks had increased by 330 per cent since the start of the year, and were targeting government, industry, critical industry, education, health and essential services providers.</p><p>The theft of intellectual property was considered to be a major motivating factor.</p><p>Mr Rogers' remarks came as relations between Australia and China deteriorated last week, when The Australian Financial Review's China correspondent Michael Smith and the ABC's Bill Birtles <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/world/asia/inside-my-escape-from-china-20200908-p55ti7\">had to return home after nerve-racking encounters with China's Ministry of State Security</url>.</p><p>They were the last two foreign correspondents for Australian news outlets in the country. It also emerged on Monday that a Chinese military contractor has compiled profiles on more than 35,000 prominent Australians, ranging from Prime Minister Scott Morrison to tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes.</p><p>The company, Zhenhua Data lists the People's Liberation Army and Communist Party among its main clients and boasts of waging \"hybrid warfare\" and manipulating reality via social media.</p><p>The relationship between Australia and China has frayed substantially since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/huawei-ban-is-just-the-start-of-the-great-decoupling-20200728-p55g2u\">federal government blocked Chinese telecommunications company Huawe</url>i from supplying equipment for the construction of the next-generation 5G mobile network.</p><p>The US and UK have followed suit in banning Huawei from their own networks. The US is also forcing ByteDance to sell its US portion of social media app TikTok, or risk it being banned on September 15.</p><p>Mr Rogers said a blanket ban on Chinese tech businesses in Western countries would be unnecessary, but he agreed with taking a cautious approach to any business, like Huawei, which is involved in critical infrastructure.</p><p>\"You have to consider, are you comfortable with the idea of there being Chinese technology in certain aspects of your infrastructure or your broader social constructs,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's not a matter of China being bad and the rest of the world being good, but in some areas there is elevated risk to our long-term national security and long-term economic competitiveness in such a way that we should not allow or endorse a China-based solution.\"</p><p>Mr Rogers, who retired from the NSA in January 2018, also weighed in on the possibility of a big tech break-up in the US.</p><p>Currently the White House is watching with interest the local competition regulator's push for the tech giants Google and Facebook to pay publishers for news. It was reported earlier this month that Google is facing an antitrust case in the US ahead of the Presidential elections.</p><p>Mr Rogers said the current period would test the boundaries between the corporate sector and government, acknowledging that tax laws in particular were formulated in a time when businesses were predominantly \"bricks and mortar\" and weren't necessarily conducive to the digital age.</p><p>But, he cautioned regulators from being too heavy-handed when it came to policing the tech giants.</p><p>\"If we're not careful and we take this to the extremes, we will kill the geese that have laid the golden eggs,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think we'll see an immediate break-up per se, but the government is asking some pretty fundamental questions of these companies.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520324648</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VN-JRJ1-JBJ7-N2T1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We have to acknowledge that they're a competitor that is willing to do things we're not ... and who does not automatically go along with the structures we've built [the last 70 years],\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think any nation in the world can say right now that they are where they want to be [in terms of their cyber defences].</p><p>\"Australia has just developed and released a cyber security strategy ... but all of us need to ask ourselves what we need to be doing differently ... We can't keep doing the same thing but expect different results.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier made a rare declaration that Australia was suffering persistent cyber attacks from a \"sophisticated state-based actor,\" which was understood to mean China.</p><p>The number of attacks had increased more than fourfold since the start of the year, targeting government, industry, critical industry, education, health and essential services providers.</p><p>The theft of intellectual property was considered to be a major motivating factor.</p><p>Mr Rogers' remarks came as relations between Australia and China deteriorated last week, when The Australian Financial Review's China correspondent Michael Smith and the ABC's Bill Birtles had to return home after interrogations by China's Ministry of State Security. They were the last two foreign correspondents for Australian news outlets in the country. It also emerged on Monday that a Chinese military contractor has compiled profiles on more than 35,000 prominent Australians, ranging from Mr Morrison to Atlassian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes.</p><p>The company, Zhenhua Data lists the People's Liberation Army and Communist Party among clients and boasts of waging \"hybrid warfare\" and manipulating reality via social media.</p><p>The Canberra-Beijing relationship has frayed since the federal government blocked Chinese telco Huawei from supplying equipment to build the next-generation 5G mobile network. The US and UK have followed suit in banning Huawei from their own networks.</p><p>The US is also forcing ByteDance to sell its US portion of social media app TikTok, or risk it being banned on September 15.</p><p>Mr Rogers said a blanket ban on Chinese tech businesses in Western countries would be unnecessary, but he agreed that taking a cautious approach to any Chinese business, such as Huawei, that is involved in a country's critical infrastructure.</p><p>\"You have to consider, are you comfortable with the idea of there being Chinese technology in certain aspects of your infrastructure or your broader social constructs,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's not a matter of China being bad and the rest of the world being good, but in some areas there is elevated risk to our long-term national security and long-term economic competitiveness in such a way that we should not allow or endorse a China-based solution.\"</p><p>Mr Rogers, who retired from the NSA in January 2018, also weighed in on the possibility of a big tech break-up in the US.</p><p>Currently the White House is watching with interest the local competition regulator's push for the tech giants Google and Facebook to pay publishers for news.</p><p>It was reported earlier this month that Google is facing an antitrust case in the United States ahead of the scheduled November 3 presidential election.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7cbowdhvt3o1hpofrnmw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VS-XWC1-JD34-V32C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Ltd. in response to the recent U.S. blacklisting of the Chinese tech firm, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chipmakers Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., mobile research firm InterDigital Wireless Inc. and South Korean carrier LG Uplus have restricted employees from informal conversations with Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, the sources said.</p><p>Such discussions are a routine part of international meetings where engineers gather to set technical standards for communications technologies, including the next generation of mobile networks known as 5G.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has not banned contact between companies and Huawei. On May 16, the agency put Huawei on a blacklist, barring it from doing business with U.S. companies without government approval, then a few days later it authorized U.S. companies to interact with Huawei in standards bodies through August as necessary for the development of 5G standards. The Commerce Department reiterated that position on Friday in response to a question from Reuters.</p><p>Nevertheless, at least a handful of major U.S. and overseas tech companies are telling their employees to limit some forms of direct interaction, the people said, as they seek to avoid any potential issues with the U.S. government.</p><p>Intel and Qualcomm said they have provided compliance instructions to employees, but declined to comment on them further.</p><p>A spokesman for InterDigital said it has provided guidance to engineers to ensure the company is in compliance with U.S. regulations.</p><p>An official with LG Uplus said the company is voluntarily refraining from interacting with Huawei workers, other than meeting for network equipment installation or maintenance issues.</p><p>Huawei did not provide comment.</p><p>5G slowdown</p><p>The new restrictions could slow the rollout of 5G, which is expected to power everything from high-speed video transmissions to self-driving cars, according to several industry experts.</p><p>At a 5G standards meeting last week in Newport Beach, California, participants privately expressed alarm to Reuters that the long-standing cooperation among engineers that is needed for phones and networks to connect globally could fall victim to what one participant described as a tech war between the U.S. and China.</p><p>A representative of a European company that has instituted rules against interaction with Huawei described people involved in 5G development as shaken. This could push everyone to their own corners, and we need cooperation to get to 5G. It should be a global market, the person said.</p><p>To be sure, several workers at smaller telecoms firms said they had not been told to avoid discussions with Huawei at standards meetings, and many vendors continue to support existing deals with Huawei. It is unclear how much further communications with Huawei have been curtailed in the tech industry, if at all.</p><p>There's been a lot of misunderstanding from what I'm seeing and hearing from clients and colleagues, as far as what the [Commerce Department] restrictions actually entail, said Doug Jacobson, a Washington-based export controls lawyer.</p><p>He said that companies prohibiting their employees contacting Huawei was excessive, because the restrictions don't preclude communication, only the transfer of technology.</p><p>Huawei, whose equipment the U.S. has alleged could be used by China to spy, has emerged as a central figure in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services.</p><p>China, U.S, and European companies have split before on standards for Wi-Fi, cell networks and other technologies, and the tit-for-tat over tariffs between Beijing and Washington has increased fears of another bifurcation.</p><p>Huawei is a top player at various global organizations that set technical specifications. As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of devices like smartphones, and the vital parts of networks such as routers and switches, Huawei will need to be at the standards-setting table to ensure a seamless customer experience when 5G networks become prevalent, engineers and experts said.</p><p>No more informal chats</p><p>Engineers and system architects representing their employers at meetings of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global consortium of industry associations that aims to set 5G specifications by March 2020, often take formal, general discussions into smaller, less documented sessions as they try to find agreement with rivals.</p><p>But at 3GPP's meeting last week in California, one of the group's three chairmen, Balazs Bertenyi of Nokia, told attendees that more of those so-called offline conversations than usual would be documented by the standards body with notes and other publicly available records.</p><p>It was the practical implication of the new U.S. Commerce Department rules given industry-wide caution despite the exemption for 5G talks, he said.</p><p>Companies want to limit informal exchanges, in which their engineers feel more comfortable discussing proprietary technology with rivals to persuade them why their research or innovations are more sound, the sources said.</p><p>A separate standards body, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), put restrictions on Huawei engineers' ability to participate in peer reviews for its publications, drawing criticism from some in China's industry and elsewhere.</p><p>The organization, which declined to comment beyond generic statements on its website, then backtracked days later after saying it had received the all-clear from the U.S. Commerce Department with respect to the peer review issue. It did not respond to requests for comment on this story.</p><p>Huawei isn't just some company. They, by many accounts, are the leader in 5G technology. Excluding them is very hard to work around, so it does stand to disrupt the entire project, said Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah and an IEEE member.</p><p>If the idea is to create a non-Chinese 5G, I'm not sure that's possible.

Executives from the world's major technology and semiconductor firms, including SK Hynix of South Korea and the semiconductor makers ARM of Britain were present in those meetings, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the Times</emphasis> claimed, citing two people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The move follows a recent warning by Chinese officials that the country's government was setting up a blacklist of \"unreliable entities\" in retaliation for the US action against Huawei. The blacklist would be similar to the US 'Entity List' of companies that US companies must seek a licence before supplying.</p><p>Last month, the Trump administration announced its decision to include telecoms equipment maker Huawei on the US Entity List over national security concerns. The decision resulted in Huawei being cut off from the sales of US technology, on which it depends for key parts of its products, threatening the company's global ambitions.</p><p>The ban was later relaxed for a period of 90 days, giving US smartphone makers, internet service providers and other companies that do business with Huawei three more months to make alternative arrangements.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New York Times </emphasis>notes that a permanent ban on Huawei (or other Chinese companies) could interfere with the long-term technology plans of China. Chinese officials have warned US companies against shifting their production lines from China to other countries - even as Chinese companies move production to Bangladesh and Vietnam - and have also asked them to raise their voices in opposition against the US government's recent policies.</p><p>Non-American firms have been told that they won't be punished by China's government if they continued to supply technology to Chinese firms.</p><p>Last week, Facebook announced its decision to cut off Huawei from its social networking app in order to comply with the US policies. Google made a similar decision last month.</p><p>Huawei argues that the allegations of trade theft and national security complaints are simply US excuses to prevent the Chinese company from becoming more powerful.

His success will be hard to repeat</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE most recognisable face of Chinese capitalism belongs to Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, an e-commerce juggernaut matched in size only by Amazon. Mr Ma, who launched Alibaba from a small apartment in Hangzhou in 1999, is an emblem of China's extraordinary economic transformation. This week's announcement that he will step down as the firm's chairman a year from now, to concentrate on philanthropy, was greeted with comparative calm by investors. He stopped being chief executive in 2013; Alibaba's share price has more than doubled since its initial public offering, the world's largest-ever, in 2014 (see \"Corporate leadership in China: Command and control\"). But one question presents itself: could China produce another story to match his? The answer is almost certainly not.</p><p>There are some very good reasons for that. China's own rise is an unrepeatable one. When Mr Ma, then an English-language teacher, launched Alibaba, the country was still gearing up to join the World Trade Organisation. Its GDP per head, in terms of purchasing-power parity, stood at under $3,000; it is now more than six times higher. The internet was still young, too. Less than 1% of Chinese had access to the web back then, compared with some 36% of Americans. As incomes grew and connections proliferated, Mr Ma took full advantage. </p><p>Thousands of small businesses have since flourished on Alibaba's platforms. About 1m merchants trade in its virtual emporiums. Its services have helped push China's economy towards consumption-led growth. Last year it boasted sales of $25bn on Singles' Day, China's equivalent of Black Friday (when Americans spent a measly $5bn). It has transformed logistics and finance, as well as retailing. Last year Alibaba delivered an average of 55m packages a day; its financial offshoot, Ant Financial, accounts for more than half of China's vast mobile-payments market. Its reach is so great that many startups decide to work with Alibaba rather than strike out alone. </p><p>But more has changed than the structure of China's economy and the clout of digital giants like Alibaba. Politics has changed, too. Alibaba thrived partly thanks to Mr Ma's skilful dealings with China's ruling Communist Party, with which he cultivated both closeness and stand-offishness (\"Love them, don't marry them,\" he once said of the government). Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, however, China's political system has grown hostile to private businesses that become too big or too disruptive. Officials have constrained bosses' freedom to make splashy deals. Bytedance, a brash technology firm set up in 2012, has been reined in, and forced to withdraw one of its apps. Its founder issued a grovelling public apology after being chastised by the government. Ant, meanwhile, has seen its aspirations to compete with state-owned banks held back by regulators (see \"Ant and Tencent: And now for something completely different\").</p><p>China is putting its corporate champions at the service of its ambitions to compete globally in high-tech industries. Alibaba's task is to use artificial intelligence to improve cities. Through state-backed venture-capital funds, the government is pouring money into industries that were once the preserve of the private sector. Rumours occasionally surface that it plans to take stakes and board seats in big tech firms. All this has fed growing international suspicion of China, especially in America. Mr Ma was one of the first out of the blocks to congratulate President Donald Trump on his election victory; this year America prevented Ant's purchase of MoneyGram, a money-transfer firm, on national-security grounds. The reality was always more complicated, but Mr Ma embodies an idea of China as market-driven and open. That idea has faded.</p><p>None of this is to say that enterprise is fizzling in China. Indeed one of Mr Ma's legacies is a shift to a culture that values startups more than ever. His charisma and folksy advice have earned him cult-like status among the country's entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists are lavishing money on hundreds of newcomers, in industries from biotech to electric vehicles. Small private firms will continue to flourish. </p><p>But it is harder to be as disruptive today as Mr Ma was 20 years ago. That is partly because his own creation is so dominant. Increasingly, however, the greatest obstacle to disruption is China's rulers. The party is intent on having a say much earlier in the development of industries that it considers important. As a result, China is unlikely to see new business leaders with the boldness and brio to match Mr Ma. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-FA7G9VP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T82-89G1-DY2R-201W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Hawley tweeted[2], 'I've invited @Apple[3] and @tiktok_us[4] to testify on Tuesday about their business in with China and the risks to American consumers. So far, they are both refusing. </p><p>Something to hide?'TikTok 'said it was unable to send a suitable delegate 'on short notice' but was committed to 'working productively' with Congress,' reported the BBC.[5] On Nov. 1, a national security review[6] of TikTok and its owner, Beijing ByteDance, was reportedly launched, with a special interest in the company's $1 billion purchase of the U.S. social media app Musical.ly. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) claims that TikTok did not seek clearance, according to Reuters[7], when it purchased Musical.ly.TikTok uses similar censorship tactics[8] as those in its mother country, China. The company has banned political ads, videos dealing with Christianity, and LGBT material. More so, the app as it is used in China has promoted Chinese Communist Party propaganda[9], including a video displaying a Chinese torture device, a tiger chair.In an interview with Axios[10], Hawley slammed Silicon Valley tech companies, such as Apple and TikTok, for trading 'our basic democratic values and the privacy and security of Americans in order to make a buck in China and to get the favor of the Beijing government.'Apple has invested a large portion of marketing into China. CEO Tim Cook was recently appointed chairman[11] of the advisory board for Tsinghua University's economics school in Beijing. He serves along with several major Chinese government officials. The company recently removed an app[12] that was being used by protestors in Hong Kong to avoid police checkpoints.After the app was pulled, Cook[13] went out of his way to meet with Chinese regulators, where he discussed Apple's proposed expansion in China.These tech companies are not the only ones involved with China. Reddit[14] recently received a $150 million investment from Chinese company Tencent, which has also poured money into Blizzard/Activision[15], the gaming company responsible for World of Warcraft.

Hawley tweeted[2], 'I've invited @Apple[3] and @tiktok_us[4] to testify on Tuesday about their business in ...th China and the risks to American consumers. So far, they are both refusing. </p><p>Something to hide?'TikTok 'said it was unable to send a suitable delegate 'on short notice' but was committed to 'working productively' with Congress,' reported the BBC.[5] On Nov. 1, a national security review[6] of TikTok and its owner, Beijing ByteDance, was reportedly launched, with a special interest in the company's $1 billion purchase of the U.S. social media app Musical.ly. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) claims that TikTok did not seek clearance, according to Reuters[7], when it purchased Musical.ly.TikTok uses similar censorship tactics[8] as those in its mother country, China. The company has banned political ads, videos dealing with Christianity, and LGBT material. More so, the app as it is used in China has promoted Chinese Communist Party propaganda[9], including a video displaying a Chinese torture device, a tiger chair.In an interview with Axios[10], Hawley slammed Silicon Valley tech companies, such as Apple and TikTok, for trading 'our basic democratic values and the privacy and security of Americans in order to make a buck in China and to get the favor of the Beijing government.'Apple has invested a large portion of marketing into China. CEO Tim Cook was recently appointed chairman[11] of the advisory board for Tsinghua University's economics school in Beijing. He serves along with several major Chinese government officials. The company recently removed an app[12] that was being used by protestors in Hong Kong to avoid police checkpoints.After the app was pulled, Cook[13] went out of his way to meet with Chinese regulators, where he discussed Apple's proposed expansion in China.These tech companies are not the only ones involved with China. Reddit[14] recently received a $150 million investment from Chinese company Tencent, which has also poured money into Blizzard/Activision[15], the gaming company responsible for World of Warcraft.

Data localisation is a key feature of India's draft Data Protection Bill and the Reserve Bank of India's guidelines on payments-related data. Interestingly, the US has raised objections to India's data localisation plans, saying that it is a goal for the US to eliminate such barriers, which weaken data security and increase the cost of doing business, and sees the proposal a major trade issue.</p><p><br/><br/>Data mirroring/localisation in the Data Protection bill<br/><br/>The localisation requirement in the Srikrishna Committee's final bill is among the legislation's most contentious features. The bill requires all data fiduciaries to store a copy of users' personal data in India. However, it doesn't clarify what constitutes personal data in different contexts. Here's what it says about restrictions on cross-border transfer of personal data:<br/><br/>(1) Every data fiduciary shall ensure the storage, on a server or data centre located in India, of at least one serving copy of personal data to which this Act applies.<br/><br/>(2) The Central Government shall notify categories of personal data as critical personal data that shall only be processed in a server or data centre located in India.<br/><br/>(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Central Government may notify certain categories of personal data as exempt from the requirement under subsection (1) on the grounds of necessity or strategic interests of the State.<br/><br/>(4) Nothing contained in sub-section (3) shall apply to sensitive personal data.<br/><br/>RBI on localisation of payments data<br/><br/>Seperately, last April, the Reserve Bank of India mandated all payments system operators working in India to ensure that people's payments data was stored only in India, and gave the companies six months to comply. Data localisation was also featured in India's draft e-commerce policy. However, the Finance Ministry suggested last month that provisions relating to data protection be excluded from the e-commerce policy, on the grounds that the issue was best handled by MeitY.<br/><br/>How have countries and firms reacted to data localisation?<br/><br/>Here is how the US government, payment companies and big tech firm have reacted to India's proposed data localisation requirements:<br/><br/>What the US government said<br/><br/>The US Trade Representative's 2019 National Trade Estimate Report criticised India's data localisation norms and draft e-commerce policy, terming certain proposals as \"most discriminatory and trade-distortive\". It said these requirements raised costs for suppliers of data-intensive services by forcing the construction of unnecessary, redundant data centres and prevent local firms from taking advantage of the best global services available. The report also said the proposals of India's draft national e-commerce policy such as data localisation requirements and restrictions on cross-border data flows were \"discriminatory\".<br/><br/>What payment companies said<br/><br/>* MasterCard CEO Ajay Banga said the challenge with localisation is not the expense, but that the data loses its predictive power once it is balkanised, compared to data that is shared across countries. MasterCard was among the first foreign payment companies that called for relaxation of the RBI's localisation directive.<br/><br/>* Visa's global president Ryan McInerney said the company was \"extremely committed\" to abiding by the RBI's data localisation mandate and also denied reports that global companies initially seemed averse to it.<br/><br/>* WhatsApp announced that it had built a system to store payments-related data locally in India even before RBI's mandate. However, as of April, WhatsApp was working to comply with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations on the local storage of payment-related data, and had delayed compliance owing to some pending engineering work.<br/><br/>* In contrast, Paytm and other domestic e-commerce/payment firms welcomed data localisation and said that 6 months was enough for companies to adhere to the RBI's guidelines.<br/><br/>What big tech companies said<br/><br/>* Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook wouldn't store sensitive data in countries where it could be improperly accessed because of weak rule of law or governments that could forcibly get access to data. He reiterated his stance against data localisation, without naming any particular country.<br/><br/>* Chinese phone manufacturer Xiaomi was one of the first firms to announce it was migrating its Indian data to \"highly secure\" Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure servers in India, from its current servers in the US and Singapore. The company said that the migration would be across Xiaomi's services - its e-commerce platform, Mi TV, Mi Coud, MIUI and Mi Community. It had said that since last July, all new Indian user data was already being stored on servers within India, and all existing data would be fully migrated by mid-September 2018.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0048028069</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-NPT1-JB5M-W1TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0008UMH</classCode><className>RESERVE BANK OF INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Profits are still booming, for sure. And property development remains one of the most powerful engines of the economy. But when developers look ahead, they see diminishing profits - and diminishing favour. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To stay at the top of the tycoon pile, they are quickly diversifying, embracing the government's new pet industry - tech. Think robotics. Think green cars. Think artificial intelligence. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Failure or success does not really matter,\" said Lung Siu-fung, an analyst at China Merchants Securities International. \"At this stage, it is the new identity card that new business can give Chinese builders that matters. Property development is clearly not the favourite kid of the government at the moment.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a sign of the shift under way, one of China's largest property developers changed its name from Longfor Properties to Longfor Group, saying the new brand is \"more aligned with the long-term business strategies,\" which include \"continuous innovation\". </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2174884/chinas-property-barons-fulfilled-ordinary-families-dreams-and\">China's property barons fulfilled ordinary families' dreams - and became fabulously wealthy</url></p><p>\"It is not easy to negotiate with the government if you are purely a property developer currently,\" Longfor CEO Shao Mingxiao recently told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">South China Morning Post</emphasis>. </p><p>Chinese developers had a bumper year in 2018, with industry sales rising 14.7 per cent to a record US$1.8 trillion, or seven times the property transactions in the US. </p><p>But the party is coming to an end, as the slowest economic growth pace in almost three decades forces owner-occupiers and investors to postpone their purchases. The order books are full of semi-built homes, with 1.45 billion square metres of housing waiting to come on line in the coming two years, according to JPMorgan Chase. </p><p>Sales are likely to drop 3.4 per cent this year, with another 1.5 percentage point decline forecast for 2020. </p><p>The warning signs are already visible, with 20 out of 24 developers tracked by JPMorgan Chase missing their 2018 sales targets. Not even the five biggest builders by market capitalisation - Country Garden Holdings, China Evergrande Group, China Vanke, Sunac China Holdings and Poly Real Estate Group - were spared. </p><p>In response, Chinese developers are remaking themselves. </p><p>There's an old Chinese saying, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">qiong ze bian, bian ze tong, tong ze jiu</emphasis>, or \"adversity leads to change and change leads to prosperity\". </p><p>For Chinese developers, the adversity has been coming in the form of government restrictions, like price caps and resale restrictions, as well as mounting debt that is hard to manage because private companies aren't favoured for bank loans. That is leading to the change. </p><p>Country Garden Holdings, China's top residential developer by sales, says it will become a hi-tech conglomerate, pouring 80 billion yuan (US$10.2 billion) into the robotics sector, which it notes will be a big cost-saver. In another example, Evergrande, the country's third-largest developer by sales, is taking a spin in electric cars. </p><p>To be sure, the early experiments can be painful. </p><p>Sun Hongbin, chairman of Tianjin-based Sunac China Holdings, ranked fourth by home sales in mainland China, said its 18.6 billion<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>yuan investment in video streaming platform Leshi was a \"failed investment\" that cost the company. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/property/article/2139404/sunac-china-makes-us158-billion-provision-investment-losses-related-leshi\">Sunac sets aside US$2.64b to cover losses in Leshi, conceding its recovery strategy has 'failed'</url></p><p>But Sun said he would continue looking for ways to expand. </p><p>\"Without the experience of pain and suffering from a loss, even the smartest person cannot grow,\" he said at a news conference last year. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robots to build homes</emphasis></p><p>The embrace of hi tech by property developers comes amid President Xi Jinping's push for the ambitious \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/made-china-2025\">Made in China 2025</url>\" plan that would transform the world's second-largest economy into an innovation powerhouse. </p><p>\"Self-determination and innovation is the unavoidable path ... to climb to the world's top as a leading player in technology,\" Xi said last May. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://multimedia.scmp.com/news/china/article/2170597/MIC2025/\">How does Beijing plan to lead the world with  Made In China 2025'?</url></p><p>Now his message echoes in speeches by developers, like one by Yeung Kwok-keung, founder and chairman of Country Garden on January 22 at the company's annual gathering. </p><p>\"We are paving the road to become a hi-tech company,\" Yeung said. \"We will embrace an era of robots building homes. It is just a matter of time. We must get it done and this will be our competitive advantage in the future,\" Yeung added, identifying property, smart agriculture and robotics as the company's three core businesses. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2174886/american-dream-home-ownership-quickly-swept-through-china-was-it-too-much\">China property: how the world's biggest housing market emerged</url></p><p>The developer's first robotic restaurant in Shunde will open after the Lunar New Year while its first robotic construction worker will help build a house in the second half of this year<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis></p><p>Meanwhile, besides electric cars, Evergrande has a US$16 billion worth blueprint for its move into hi-tech sectors, such as life sciences, aviation, quantum science, new energy, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and modern agriculture. </p><p>Greenland Holdings, the sixth-largest China developer by sales last year, invested 300 million yuan in AI and smart retail company DeepBlue Technology. </p><p>And China Vanke has entered into ventures with some big tech innovators, including Microsoft, artificial intelligence start-up SenseTime, and China electric vehicle maker Nio. </p><p>With Microsoft, for example, it is looking at smart home projects, among others. </p><p>AI, big data, Internet of Things (IOT) and cloud computing can help Vanke build up the basic platform of its core business, Vanke CEO Yu Liang said at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 in Shanghai. Technology will become the new driver of Vanke by 2024, he said. </p><p>\"In the future, hi-tech will empower Vanke's full-service system to create a more future-oriented China,\" Yu said. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Industry has seen its ceiling'</emphasis></p><p>To be sure, developers aren't abandoning their property cash cow. </p><p>\"The investment in robotic business is not a diversification but an enhancement of the property products' competitiveness,\" Mo Bin, CEO of Country Garden, told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">South China Morning Post</emphasis>. \"We will not give up property development. That's our main business. If we are no longer a developer, all our AI or robotics investments have become meaningless.\" </p><p>The CEO said cost control is the top reason the company is turning to robotic construction. </p><p>\"We are now talking about construction work worth 600 billion yuan. If we assigned 200 billion yuan to robotics, we would save 5 per cent of the cost. That is huge,\" Mo added. </p><p>Cheng Guangyu, Country Garden's vice president, says that robots are more efficient than humans at repetitive tasks. The company has been testing out robots that cook and do building tasks.  </p><p>\"Building homes in the future will be like making a car - most of the processes can be done by automation,\" Cheng said. \"Every developer builds similar space. Value-added services distinguish a company from others.\" </p><p>But Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Finance, said developers understand that diversification into pet projects of Beijing will be helpful to their property projects. </p><p>\"It's better to play down, gesture goodwill to the authorities. After all, a good relationship with regulators is vital to every developer,\" said Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Finance. \"If you hew to the government's preferred agenda, you can expect the regulators to have mercy on you. For example, it might be easier to get pre-sale permission [to sell flats before they are completed] and lower financing costs.\" </p><p>Alan Jin, property analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia, described the period of experimenting that developers are going through as lots of anxiety but also lots of new hope. </p><p>\"You will see more developers doing this following their peers even though no one knows whether any of the new businesses can be profitable,\" Jin said. \"Yet, in the short-term, property is still the major moneymaking machine.\" </p><p>Even Wanda Group - which unloaded US$9.3 billion in hotel and tourism after drawing the ire of Beijing over its huge overseas shopping spree - is learning how to safely expand its focus to be in line with Xi's visions for the country. </p><p>Only a few years ago, chairman Wang Jianlin said he would overwhelm Shanghai Disney with a series of extravagant theme parks. Now, after selling down assets and getting past regulatory scrutiny, he is building a US$1.74 billion theme park that will recreate the 1930s Communist Party's revolutionary birthplace in Yan'an, with visitors able to dress in liberation army garb. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong-china/article/2177994/wanda-build-us174-billion-theme-park-cradle-chinese\">Wanda to build a US$1.74 billion theme park in the cradle of the Chinese Communist revolution to cash in on 'red tourism'</url></p><p>\"The industry has seen its ceiling,\" said Danielle Wang, a China property analyst at DBS Vickers. \"The era of its growth spurt is over and there must be a slowdown in every developer's expansion. They need new drivers for their company's further growth.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2019. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Monday, July 15th, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets poised for a higher open, looking to push to new all-time highs, this following a record setting week for the Dow, NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500, all three major market gauges, rising to new highs on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 closing above 3,000 for the very first time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors have their eyes on earnings. Second quarter earnings season kicks into high gear this week, big banks reporting will kick off with Citi, this morning. We've got everything that you need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Barry still dumping massive amount of rain, the storm hitting land as the hurricane causing damage and disrupting oil production of the Gulf of Mexico, now downgraded to a tropical depression, but still a danger as it heads north. We have a live report from on thte ground.</p><p>High-tech threat, millionaire Peter Thiel is reportedly calling for an investigation into Google, over its work with China, what these allegations could mean going forward. MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.</p><p>A big show coming up this morning and every morning, I'm going to be speaking with Mark Short, the vice president's chief of staff, acting director for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, and Rafferty Capital Market's chief financial strategist, Dick Bove, you don't want to miss any of those gentlemen or any of the fantastic people from FOX Business who are coming up.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning, FOX Business' Deirdre Bolton, speaking of fantastic, PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle, and Cleary Strategies president, former White House correspondent, Ronica Cleary, welcome one and all. Mitch, I know you've been crunching numbers all weekend other than going to the Home Depot.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: I was at Home Depot --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch made a selfie from the Home Depot and so we'll talk.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I am not boycotting Home Depot --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: -- to be clear.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank goodness. But let's talk about markets and earnings.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: I was like, I want to know what he's building, but I guess we'll get to that later.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's probably fixing a faucet.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's not get crazy. Let's talk about the markets and the record-breaking run last week. Futures are pointing to a higher open, a 28-point gain on the Dow Futures, gains across the board after all three major market gauges finished in record territory on Friday.</p><p>Second quarter earnings season kicks off in about two hours, when Citi reports. President Trump, tweeting on the economy last night, we're doing great, economically, as a country, number one, despite the Feds antiquated policy on rates and tightening, much room to grow.</p><p>So Mitch, let's start with -- again, the Feds are getting ready to cut interest rates based on all indications. So that's not tightening. But let's talk about earnings season, what do you expect, because again, rip -- to, quote Maria, \"a rip roaring market\" but you have earnings are expected to come in negative for this quarter.</p><p>Last quarter, same -- I mean, for the second quarter, and negative even in the third quarter based on expectations right now.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Clearly, the good news is the Fed potentially making money more easy, but the bad news is, estimates for the second quarter are down three percent, and that was the estimate for the first quarter, as well, and then came in almost flat, so they may be a little (INAUDIBLE) the sandbagging going on by Corporate America.</p><p>But there are 80 in the S&amp;P 500 that are indicating that, perhaps, the earnings will be disappointing the guidance that they've already given.</p><p>So, it's strange that the market is as enthusiastic, right now, going into earnings season, I think what market participants know is, the fact of the matter is the back end of the (INAUDIBLE) will be stronger and maybe some of these companies are going to beat expectations as they normally do, about 80 percent of the S&amp;P 500 tends to beat expectations.</p><p>So, I think baked into the pricing right now, is the fact that earnings are going to be very slow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, because they were negative in the first quarter, down three-tenths of one percent. The expectation for the second quarter is three percent decline.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right, which is the exact expectation for the first quarter when they came in down --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But still negative, and the expectation for the third quarter is negative nine-tenths of a percent, so almost one percent, so we are officially looking at an earnings recession which the GDP numbers on corporate profits have already told us that based on the fourth quarter and first quarter.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The one thing to remember that last year was an aberration because of the benefit of the lower tax corporate tax rates. So we are comparing this year to much different last year.</p><p>BOLTON: (INAUDIBLE) and there are a lot of people who when you look at, like, P.E. ratio, right, for all of these companies saying we're not really sure that its earnings growth that is driving the stock market higher. It's the fact that debt has been so cheap.</p><p>I'm actually watching -- Reuters came out with a report yesterday, saying that U.S. companies may be able to do business with Huawei, so I know that's giving a little support, that's not confirmed, that's just one news organization that has it, but that's giving a little support to tech this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a report out that we're going to get it to later this hour, about Huawei cutting jobs here in the United States, so again, that's the --</p><p>BOLTON: As a result of being blacklisted.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly. So that's part of the trade tensions with China and the United States because it it's all part of one thing. BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer, Rick Rieder, was on Maria Bartiromo's Wall Street, weighing in on these markets. Listen to this. I'll get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We heard a little Jay Powell, the Fed, we heard some ECB, we've got the minutes there. What's your reaction?</p><p>RICK RIEDER, CIO, BLACKROCK GLOBAL FIXED INCOME: It was a huge week. I think we were going to go down actually last two weeks, we're (INAUDIBLE) when you think about after the trade agreement, we can debate agreement or not, but it was after that, then you had Powell, you know, the ECB, and the Christine Lagarde news is a very big piece of news.</p><p>You know, I think the ECB is going to be more aggressive going forward. Markets have certainly started to react to that. And by the way, the CPI report, you know, we don't think inflation is moving that much higher, but it's nice to see that now, all of a sudden, there's a bit of pricing power that companies for the equity market.</p><p>You know, I thought it was pretty interesting that, you know, you had a bit more inflation or the people saying oh my God, that's going to be hard for the Fed, not really. That the Fed is going to keep moving because they're worried about global growth.</p><p>Companies have pricing power and you're seeing some places like used cars are a bit better, apparels are a bit better, the places that have been really been tough. It's pretty good news. So yes, you know, if you take the last two weeks, pretty good set of developments for the markets.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of global growth, we found out this morning, that China is experiencing a pretty serious economic slowdown, the report out was that the economy in China grew at 6.2 percent in the second quarter, it sounds awesome, but it's the slowest rates since, at least, 1992, so the slowest rate on record.</p><p>The president's policy, this tough trade policy, the terror fight is taking a toll on the Chinese economy. Ronica, ultimately, that weighs on the U.S.</p><p>RONICA CLEARY, PRESIDENT, CLEARY STRATEGIES: It does. And this is where the president will have to really test the loyalty of his supporters. I hate to put everything in a context of an election because we shouldn't be making decisions based on --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the real house.</p><p>CLEARY: Yes, exactly, but at the end of the day, people have to be willing to, you know, have this long-term understanding of the fact that this is going to take a while and there's going to be some pain before there would be potentially any gain, but when you hear people on the ground, talking about the president's policies with tariffs and trade, a lot of Trump supporters say they're willing take the pain, because China is too powerful. They're willing to go through this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Mitch, a sign that this is working, the story in the Journal, is one of the top stories in the paper, manufactures are moving their supply chains out of China. That this is part of the strategy, it's not just that, finally, you have a president standing up, getting tough, and manufactures are saying and -- American companies are saying, you know what?</p><p>This is -- this is going to be a sea-change, just to name a few of them. Crocs, YETI Coolers, Roomba and GoPro, furniture maker Lovesac, will make 60 percent of its furniture in China, down from 75 percent, a lot of that is going to Vietnam.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: What's really interesting is -- and I've spoken to a lot of business leaders and I've asked them about tariffs and supply chain and they were really reluctant to start shifting around where they make stuff, but what's interesting is not the tariffs, per se, it's the uncertainty regarding whether then not they'll be in.</p><p>And what they want the certainty, and if they can find certainty in Indonesia or in Malaysia or in India or in Vietnam, then they're going to shift there. The problem is, it's a very long process. You just can't pick up and move a factory and define a vender in that local jurisdiction that you can trust, is a challenge.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it depends on how complicated the products are that are manufactured, the more complicated the product, the harder it is to move it out of China, because the way that they're manufacturing, so --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Top notch, quite frankly.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And one of those things that's happening --</p><p>BOLTON: And cheap, right? I mean, that's really is what is cheap.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And cost is the big thing. The reason why they're not bringing them back here is they just can't replace the labor cost. It's a night and day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let's stay on China, investigating Google, this is -- that's what billionaire investor, Peter Thiel, reportedly says that the FBI and CIA should be doing as a result of a tech giant's work with the Chinese military.</p><p>Again, this is something -- this is fight that President Trump has taken on to call out China, again, its military aggression, its desire to essentially dominate the entire world.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, and I think what Peter Thiel is saying, we'll have the U.S. military, but you will work with China, and this is based on his view of a project that Google was doing as having a censored search engine in China.</p><p>So, I'm not -- you know, I think the implication is that it could have military implications. I'm not sure it's a direct line, but Peter Thiel certainly, you know, he likes to cause a rift in the waters every now and then and this time is no different.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I think him speaking at the Republican convention again. He was --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, I mean, and he's very, obviously, disruptive. But yes, we'll see what this does to Google stock today.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think, looking at big tech is something that's probably bipartisan if both sides of the aisle could agree upon what they don't like about big tech. But the fact of the matter is (INAUDIBLE) to many candidates on the -- on the campaign trail. They're attacking big business and it's big tech that's part of the big business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and to bring it full circle, big tech is one of the areas that people are very concerned about in terms of the earnings growth there, and -- in terms of they've been -- as the Journal calls them the (INAUDIBLE) of the stock market's run in recent years and a decline in margins for the sector, as it's widely expected, threatens to change that.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, that's been leaning -- tech has been leading this rally right for the past 18 months, so it's true with all of these concerns that doesn't bode well if tax slows down. I don't see the replacement sector, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: We've got retail sales coming out later this week, right? For the last -- for the -- not -- for May, they were up half of one percent.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And they revised previous months up. I think retail sales are going to be strong if you want to -- you heard it here first (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Prime Day.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Prime Day is today.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Prime Day today. Hey, I've got a free bag at Whole Foods yesterday.</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, I know, wasn't that the best? All of a sudden, wow, somebody gives me a free bag? I'm overly enthusiastic about this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I had a long conversation with the cashier who helped me about what it was like to work there.</p><p>BOLTON: Is that right? Positive? Negative?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, they have health insurance and dental --</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and 401(k). You know, in this day and age, if you get dental insurance, it's pretty good. She said --</p><p>BOLTON: That's great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And she likes it better than her previous job at Walgreens.</p><p>BOLTON; OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And she gets paid more. So there you go.</p><p>BOLTON: Wow. That sounds like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And a 401(k) plan.</p><p>CLEARY: And free bags for everyone.</p><p>BOLTON: It was just one day only, made my Sunday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You find in New York, it's not -- it's not the company that people work for, it's the people that they have to deal with, the customers, not the corporation.</p><p>Coming up, Louisiana under water, a clean-up from Tropical Storm Barry begins today as flood waters start to recede there, but threat is not over yet, we have the latest. Plus, Huawei struggled, the Chinese telecom giant planning massive layoffs here in the U.S., the fallout from the blacklist, straight ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Iran, offering to negotiate with the United States under one condition, Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen, good morning. Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, said in a televised speech yesterday that Iran is willing to talk with the U.S. but only if sanctions are lifted.</p><p>Iran recently begun surpassing uranium enrichment limits set, back in the 2015 deal, but they said that these moves can be reversed if given enough economic incentives. In an interview with the Washington Post, Secretary of State Pompeo dismissed Rouhani's idea.</p><p>Well, financier Jeffrey Epstein due back in court today for a bail hearing as several more women claimed they were abused by Epstein when they were minors. The convicted sex offender has offered to put up his $77 million- dollar Manhattan apartment and his private jet as collateral to guarantee that he'll show up for trial on federal sex trafficking charges.</p><p>Federal prosecutors, though, they're opposing his bail. They charge that Epstein pay $350,000 to buy the silence of potential witnesses.</p><p>Well, major layoffs reportedly are coming to Huawei here in the United States. Wall Street Journal is reporting that hundreds of people could be let go after the Trump administration blacklisted the company. These job cuts expected to affect Huawei's research and developments (INAUDIBLE) which has labs in California, Texas, and Washington state. And those are your headlines, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. And I'll tease the story that you have coming up, de Blasio must go. New York City fell into a blackout, and this dude was in Iowa, managing the crisis from Iowa. So, I know it's a New York story, but he is running for the Democratic nomination, we're going to talk about that coming up.</p><p>CASONE: I can't wait.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: I love --</p><p>MCDOWELL: People are really angry.</p><p>CASONE: I can't even start, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: We'll have that in a bit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what? You need to make the trains run on time to keep the lights on. That's pretty much the, you know, the basic elements of your job. And this guy can't even do that. And then we'll take you down south. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Extreme weather in the south, Tropical Storm Barry leaves much of Louisiana underwater and it's taking a toll on gulf oil production, what it means about prices at the pump as they rise, plus, Amazon Prime Day, how a strike could impact you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tornado and flash flood warnings are threatening the gulf coast as water start to recede in Louisiana. Thousands remain in the dark with tropical depression Barry, slowly moving inland. FOX News' Casey Stegall is live in New Orleans with an update for everybody, hey Casey.</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey Dagen, good to see you. Fifty one thousand customers around the state of Louisiana, still remain without power this morning. Although, the number is going in the right direction, considering the energy company here says that service to about 188,000 customers has already been restored.</p><p>Nearly 4,000 energy crews are out and about putting up new poles and lines, working to get everyone back online as soon as possible. Meantime, as you said, the recovery has already started in some of the lower lying parishes that took on water.</p><p>Look at this video out of Grand Isle, Louisiana, it's just south of here, where the U.S. coast guard says it is inspecting the waterways to make sure that they are safe for boat traffic to resume. That is a huge fishing spot down there and shrimping spot, a lot of boats in and out. Louisiana's governor saying he is grateful Barry did not pack as big of a punch as they were thinking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA: Obviously, Barry has been an extremely slow-moving storm that from its very inception, has behaved differently than other storms, other tornadoes that we have experienced.</p><p>That being said, I, for one, am extremely grateful that the forecast did rains and flooding, did not materialize.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEGALL: Meantime, flights are slowly starting to resume at New Orleans international airport today, last night, Delta Airlines started bringing in aircraft and trying to get flights going. Bus services are supposed to resume today here, in New Orleans.</p><p>So, no doubt this thing is starting to lift up into Arkansas now creating problems for people up there, but right now, New Orleans really breathing a collective sigh of relief this morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Casey, thank you so much for that, Casey Stegall in New Orleans. Meantime, oil production in the Gulf of Mexico taking a hit as Tropical Storm Barry makes its way through the region, tropical depression causing a 73 percent shutdown of production there.</p><p>Joining us now, Price Futures Group, Phil Flynn, good to see you, Phil, as always, this production --</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, ENERGY MARKET ANALYST, PRICE FUTURES GROUP: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- can get back up pretty quickly, assuming there's not any damage.</p><p>FLYNN: It really can. And we're already seeing that some of the ExxonMobil and a couple of the other companies are already out there, restarting production. And it's almost amazing to me when you consider the fact of what they had to do to get all of these people off these platforms that are out in the Gulf of Mexico safely.</p><p>Get the production out of harm's way, moving things around, and immediately after the storm, almost within, you know, 24 hours or 48 hours, they'll be back to full production. It's just amazing.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Hey, good morning, Phil, it's Mitch Roschelle. Where is the, sort of, state of play of supply and demand of oil, not just the domestic supply that we have, but also if you look at it more globally.</p><p>FLYNN: You know, globally, if you listen to the International Energy Agency, they're saying that there's plenty of supply to go around, in fact, they're predicting by 2020, an international oil glut. But that prediction really comes with a really negative outlook for the global economy.</p><p>You know, they're looking at some short-term data, telling us that they think that demand growth is going to, you know, stop because of U.S.-China trade war. I don't think they're taking into consideration all the stimulus we're seeing around the globe.</p><p>We saw that in the Chinese economic data this morning, for example, with the GDP, even though that was weak, we're starting to see the stimulus start to kick in with retail sales industrial production, that's good for oil demand.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about prices for gasoline at the pump? What do you expect to happen there? Because again, the problem in the U.S. has been, for months, really getting the crude oil to the refineries and the pipeline capacity in some way right, Phil?</p><p>FLYNN: It really has been. I mean, you know, the U.S. is producing a record amount of oil, but are we doing it very efficiently, are we able to get it to where it needs to be? We need to build more pipelines in this country, not only for oil, but for natural gas to really reflect a growing demanding.</p><p>From the storm, you know we've seen prices nationally go up about $0.04 a gallon since the storm began. I assume that we're going to start to give that back when the production comes back on. But keep in mind, you know, U.S. gasoline demand is stellar right now, it's near all-time highs, and that's good news, because it's reflecting a very strong U.S. economy.</p><p>BOLTON: Phil, I know (INAUDIBLE) there are some new emission standards that are meant to come online, is this going to change? I've heard some analysts say, in the next six months, the energy market is going to be very different because of these. Do you agree?</p><p>FLYNN: I do agree. This maritime standard for diesel fuel is really going to have a major impact, and the industry has been trying to get prepared for this for the last couple of years. It reminds me of when they initially took sulfur out of heating oil, and diesel fuel.</p><p>It was a process. It meant higher prices, tighter supplies. Prices will be higher because of this. The question is, by how much? The refiners are doing a great job trying to keep that not too much, but I assume it's going to be, at least, $0.10 a gallon.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Phil, real quick, what about the East Coast impact on gasoline prices because of that refinery fire in Pennsylvania?</p><p>FLYNN: Yes. Thank you, Europe, you sent us all your gasoline. You sent us your barrels, thank you. Europe saw a great opportunity here. They were sent every gallon of gasoline they could. If hey, we're not selling it over here, send it to the U.S. And, you know, they saw that Statue of Liberty with a flag, saying we need gasoline, and they sent them tankers right away.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's called trade. That's why we like --</p><p>FLYNN: It's great. I love them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- open free trade. Because they're there if they've got the excess supply, they're there when we need it. Phil, thank you so much.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you, you have a fantastic week, hopefully we'll see you before the --</p><p>FLYNN: You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- end of it. Coming up, 2020 outlook, a new poll shows President Trump losing in head-to-head matchups against top Democratic candidates, plus lights out, a blackout leaves parts of New York City in the dark. J. Lo's concert at the garden had to stop. Yes, why some say this is it, over, Dunzo, out, for Mayor Bill de Blasio.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 15th. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Markets poised for a higher open, look into a push to new all-time highs. This after a record-setting week for the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P 500 gains across the board. Record closes for all. The S&amp;P 500 closing above 3,000 for the very first time.</p><p>Investors have their eyes on quarterly earnings. Second quarter earnings season kicks off this morning with really -- with Citigroup. We have the numbers and we'll tell you everything you need to know.</p><p>In Europe, we have buying in England and Germany a slight loss on the CAC Quarante in France. And in Asia overnight, the Nikkei was closed for a holiday. Gains in Shanghai and in Hong Kong as well. More signs of a slowdown in China, however. The economy, they are growing at -- yes, it's strong, 6.2 percent in the second quarter. That was the slowest rate since at least 1992.</p><p>Moving on, Amazon Prime Day is here as consumers shop for deals, some workers in Minnesota are protesting the retail giant.</p><p>And lights out in New York City. A massive blackout over the weekend bringing business to halt. Broadway shows could not go on. Broadway was dark. Parts of the city were dark and the mayor was in Iowa. The calls for him to resign.</p><p>And high tech threat, billionaire Peter Thiel reportedly calling for an investigation into Google over its work with China. What these allegations could mean for the tech company?</p><p>And Bitcoin plunging. The cryptocurrency diving more than 10 percent over the weekend. Briefly trading below 10,000. This following last week's comments were President Trump saying that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p>To your top story this half-hour. 20/20 vision, new head-to-head general election polls from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal show that top Democrats beat President Trump in 2020.</p><p>The president trailing former Vice President Joe Biden 51 to 42 percent in a head-to-head with Senator Bernie Sanders. The president doesn't fare much better. Trailing Sanders 50 percent to 43. The president also losing in polls to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.</p><p>Joining me now, CampusReform.org media director Cabot Phillips. Cabot, what did these mean at this point in the cycle if anything, these head-to- head matchups?</p><p>CABOT PHILLIPS, CAMPUS REFORM: Yes, they don't mean as much as I think a lot of the Democrats would like them to mean. I'd like to remind people in 2016 at this point, Jeb Bush was the clear favorite. He was going to be the nominee, all the polling said it had to be so. Clearly didn't work out that way. The bottom line is a lot of Americans when asked on the phone, who are you going to support might say, \"Well, I don't like Donald Trump, he's a little mean for me.</p><p>I'm going to support the Democrat. But the bottom line is we know from history people vote with their pocketbooks. They vote based on how the economy is doing and when it gets down to them in the polling booth and they actually see record wage growth, where they see unemployment plunging when they see 16-year high confidence from consumers or in this country.</p><p>They are not going to want to fundamentally reshape the economy, and that's what the Democrats are promising. I think that's a mistake for the Democrat Party because people see the economy thriving under President Trump's leadership whether they like him or not. And I think, ultimately, barring some kind of economic step back that's -- you know, unforeseen, I think, he's going to cruise to re-election.</p><p>CLEARY: Cabot, you know, it's interesting you talk about mistakes. I think there is a mistake in the focus that people put on these things like polling. There's a lack of attention put on the economy.</p><p>And also the idea that polling a candidate like Joe Biden today versus who Joe Biden may be forced to be by the time we get to the end of this primary being pushed further and further to the left, so much still has the potential to change. But, where will President Trump be pushed over this time?</p><p>PHILLIPS: Well, I think the Democrats are going to try and push him on things that aren't the issues. They know that if it comes down to the issues, our country is doing very well. And right now, on the debate stage, they're making the mistake of saying the economy is not working for anyone. People are not happy with how what's going. We're going to come in and fundamentally reshape the way things are going.</p><p>That might work if the economy was not working, but the fact is the vast majority of Americans saw attacks got under the tax proposal by the Republicans. Vast majority people seeing their wages grow and they're looking around and this doomsday picture being painted by the Democrat Party is not being matched up with the results they're seeing. And I think that is a misplaying of the Democrat hand.</p><p>And again, I think as the campaign goes on, the Democrats are going to beat each other up on the debate stage. And also, they're going to be pushed further left. So, a lot of these more moderate candidates they might have a higher approval rating right now from average voters. They're going to realize that a lot of these candidates are more extreme than they think because the debate is going to inevitably draw people further to the left in an attempt to win the primary.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, raise your hand if you want to take away private insurance for 180 million Americans.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We saw Elizabeth Warren do that and I said then, it will come back to haunt her in the -- in the coming months even as the Democrats gear upstart voting in January. But I want to ask Mitch Rochelle about the economy given the length of the expansion Mitch, longer than a decade, the longest on record, can the economy keep growing at a modest pace, decent pace into next year?</p><p>Because we have a tendency to focus on the bat like any signs that might say weakness. But from 35,000 feet, it still looks really solid which you've been talking about.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I would say that since two-thirds to 75 percent of the economy in any given quarter comes from the consumer. And the consumer still fundamentally strong, and the consumers stimulated with low-interest rates. Business investment is not overly robust but it's strong enough. And then, government investment is the last piece. There's nothing in that equation that looks like it's really retreating.</p><p>So, even if the economy grows at the sort of that new normal of one percent dish, it's still going to continue to grow and not contract. So, we're not going to see a recession, I don't think.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to move on to the president on Twitter over the weekend. President Trump taking aim at far left progressive House members, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, tweeting this. \"So interesting to see progressive Democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt, and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all.</p><p>Now, loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime- infested places from which they claim? Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements.\"</p><p>Cabot called by many, particularly those on the left, racist. Nancy Pelosi said that, that was xenophobic, these comments. But it just seems like the Democrats with the fight between the four individuals who we assume that the president was referring to, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. That he basically to use the term that the Wall Street Journal editorial board uses, he belly-flopped into a situation where he did not need to be.</p><p>PHILLIPS: Yes, I think that's absolutely the case. There are plenty of times where people get riled up for no reason over tweets on President Trump. This is not one of those times. I think people have every reason to be upset with this kind of rhetoric.</p><p>The fact is if you're an American citizen immigrated here, you don't have anywhere else, you need to go back to if you disagree with people on policies. This is your home now, and I think this is an unforced error from the president, there's absolutely a conversation to be had about why we shouldn't be embracing policies that have failed in other countries.</p><p>But to say that someone you disagree with should go back, there -- every bit as American, if you're a citizen, you're an American there's nowhere you need to go back just because you might disagree with people.</p><p>I think this is an unforced error. It's not what the Republican Party is about, and I think President Trump is helping to unite people against him at a time when the Democrat Party has been especially -- there's been a lot of infighting, I think, now he's given them an easy target this was an unforced error on his part. And I do think that this was a mistake that people do have a right to be upset about.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I just add one thing that we assume that the reference was to -- as I said, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Ilhan Omar. Ilhan Omar is the only one of those women born outside of the United States. And these were -- this was a Democratic Party that was essentially eating itself and destroying itself.</p><p>And the president, again, to use that word, belly-flopped right into the middle of it, and said something that was offensive to many Americans.</p><p>PHILLIPS: And in 2020, the Democrats do not want to make this campaign about the issues. Their rhetoric has been while the Republican Party's anti-immigrant, the Republican Party's instance if they don't care about you. And this makes it easy for them to try to paint that picture which isn't true.</p><p>But again, if this is true, if this campaign is about the issues in 2020, Democrats lose every single time. That's why they don't want to make it about these. They don't want to make it about tax reform, they want to make it about tweets like this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>PHILLIPS: And I think it's an unforced error that is -- that is not necessary.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, the president just united the Democrats when they were destroying each other. He just united the Democrats and every liberal voter in this country. Thank you, Cabot. Good to see you. Cabot Phillips</p><p>PHILLIPS: Appreciate it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Amazon workers on strike during the company's annual Prime Day. Cheryl Casone has the details coming up. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, hey, Dagen, we're going to do it right now. Amazon workers in Minnesota using this major sales day today. At the company to call for higher pay and better working conditions. And there's a lot of potential revenue riding on Prime Day.</p><p>Amazon sold over $100 million products during last year's holiday. One market research firm predicts 250 competing retailers including Wal-Mart, Target, and eBay are also going to be put in items on sale. Let's pick it back Wal-Mart started at their sale, yesterday. Amazon, though, is slightly higher in the pre-market.</p><p>Well, Gilead Sciences is increasing at stake in a biotech firm, Galapagos. The Wall Street Journal reports that Gilead is going to pay more than $5 billion to boost its ownership stake to as much as 30 percent. The company going to get two seats on Galapagos's board of directors as part of that deal as it's structured.</p><p>Now, there is this. The U.S. Air Force has issued a warning against a Facebook group that plans to storm a major military base. More than 400,000 people have joined a Facebook event page to storm Area 51 in Nevada in September. To get secret information about aliens and UFOs.</p><p>The military says, the U.S. Air Force already stands ready to protect America and its assets. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think that Facebook event was a joke in the beginning. And that was 40,000 people on the darn page. Good luck with that folks. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, feel like I'm not getting arrested.</p><p>CASONE: Have fun in jail because you -- all those UFOs that are Area 51 already.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the -- and the, the desert in that part of the country is very, very unforgiving, I will say that.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And then, September is pretty darn hot too. So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, indeed. But we did love an alien hunter.</p><p>CLEARY: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Roswell new -- I have a Roswell, New Mexico t-shirt.</p><p>BOLTON: I do sometimes think like the people protecting us, you know, like this is the kind of stuff that they deal with all the time, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: These are all the things we don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly. Coming out, left in the dark. Parts of New York City suffering from a major power outage over the weekend. And now, there are calls for Mayor Bill de Blasio to get out, next.</p><p>Plus, Bitcoin's Tomball, it's under pressure this morning as more questions come up about regulating cryptocurrencies. More when we come back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Headlines across America this morning, the New York Times says: \"Blackout Con Edison apologizes but offers clues about root cause.\" Con-Ed apologizing for the Saturday outage that left at least 72,000 customers in the dark. Officials with Con-Ed saying there was a significant electrical transmission disturbance and the outage was not caused by demand. The New York Post editorial board also calling for the removal of Mayor Bill de Blasio; he was campaigning in Iowa when the power went out. Yes.</p><p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel writes fewer people are smoking cigarettes so state tax revenue is down, now Wisconsin will tax e-cigs. The state collected over $100 million less in cigarette taxes last year compared to 2010. As a result, lawmakers passed $0.5 per milliliter tax on e- cigarettes fluid. The new tax is projected to bring in about $5.5 million over the next two years.</p><p>The State reporting Taco Bell releases new menu item with South Carolina heat. The chain releasing two new dishes that incorporate the Carolina Reaper Pepper, declared the spiciest pepper in the world back in 2013. You can get Stake Reaper Ranch Fries or Stake Reaper Ranch Burrito at participating locations. I doubt that there's much reaper in those dishes because you would not be able to eat them. But what do you make --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You'll keep asking for glasses of milk every other bite, right?</p><p>CLEARY: People would be suing Taco Bell, it's too hot. Crazy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know somebody said -- I think it was Jason (INAUDIBLE), the musician, said that his wife grew some reapers and went and went at the back and just took a bite one. Grew some reapers in the backyard and took a big bite to one. I want to talk about really quickly -- just when you think that this mayor can't get any worse, he's in Iowa when the power goes out. I think the J.Lo show at Madison Square Garden had to stop at mid- show.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Apparently, she's going to do another one so that her fans (INAUDIBLE) suffering too much. But I think as a New Yorker, when you're riding in the subways and it's raining and your subway car, you know, we knew a while ago that he wasn't exactly on it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Never underestimate the ego and self-delusion of a politician, that this man think; he can't even get the trains to run on time and clean the streets in New York City.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Or be rain-free. I'm interested in rain-free subway car.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is basically a giant testimony to the failure of government, of bureaucrats and, and lawmakers when it comes to the social safety net in New York. This man has failed every New Yorker.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're laughing but it's dangerous. I mean, for older people to be stuck in a subway car underground, I mean, there's tons of people who live in high-rises with babies, again, older people -- I mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This man has failed to take care of at-risk children, he's failed to improve the homeless situation despite spending several billion dollars more on the homeless problem, public housing and receivership because people were getting sick in public housing here. Mental illness -- you're talking about a billion dollars that's been spent on mental health - -</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Our schools.</p><p>MCDOWELL: On schools here. Again, that's school program had to be shut down because it was a complete failure. Failure. Failure. Failure. And now, blackout.</p><p>CLEARY: And for all of the things that you're saying about -- the failure to respond properly to a crisis like the blackout, that's the icing on top. We can't forget -- remember that Chris Christie and Obama hug after Sandy and (INAUDIBLE) it was?</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is about New York City. This is about New York City.</p><p>CLEARY: But it's the same. This is what people remember. They remember that he's in Iowa. That's what they remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. President Trump tweeting on China: \"China's second- quarter growth the slowest it's been in more than 27 years. The U.S. tariffs are having a major impact, a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal with the U.S. and wishes that it'd not broken the original deal in the first place. In the meantime, we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from China with possibly much more to come. These tariffs are paid for by China devaluing and pumping not by the U.S. taxpayer.\" Mitch, well, if you're paying much -- it's being paid by some -- it's being paid by some American companies.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. Absolutely. Tariffs do not get absorbed by a company and then not alter how they do business as a result of the tariff.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here, we're paying it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It's either passed along to consumer or somehow otherwise eaten up in their system which means they're not paying for something else. They're not going to compromise profitability.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, Peter Thiel takes on big tech, why the billionaire investor has said that Google has been compromised by Chinese intelligence agencies. Plus, Bitcoin slides, how criticism of cryptocurrency is driving the digital coin market.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big tech in focus. Billionaire tech investor, Peter Thiel, reportedly calling for the FBI and CIA to investigation whether Chinese intelligence has infiltrated Google. Thiel slamming Google for its decision to work with the Chinese military while refusing to renew a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. Joining me now Disruptive Tech Founder Chief Analyst, Lou Basenese. Lou, good to see you, what do you make of these remarks? Is there a back story that we don't know?</p><p>LOU BASENESE, FOUNDER, DISRUPTIVE TECH: Look, I mean, think about Huawei. I think there's absolutely a concern here. In today's digital world where we miniaturized chips, how can we not be concerned about foreign governments infiltrating U.S. systems. And with everything online, it's a legitimate threat; it's a question that needs to be asked that Google should be willing to answer and be transparent about.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you talk about Google being transparent, I mean, Peter Thiel seems more like he's raising questions, right? He's saying tricky questions: one of which, OK, why isn't google working with the FBI and CIA but is willing to be developing this product with China -- you know, the search engine that could be more or less controlled by the Chinese government and then heavy implication here on military? I mean, is Peter to Dagen's point, does he have an ax to grind with Google?</p><p>BASENESE: I mean, I don't know that he has an ax to grind with Google but I think he's raising legitimate concerns here. You know, Google has had plans to have a different version of their search engine in China. It was a couple of months ago when they denied there were rumors that they were working on it again and they put those to bed. It sounds like Peter may have information where they're continuing to work on it. And again, we're dealing in a world where things -- the weapons of today are digital, not physical. I think he's raising perfectly legitimate concerns and they should be answered.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Turning to cryptocurrency, Lou, the SEC is looking at whether Facebook's planned cryptocurrency, Libra, should fall under its oversight. Regulators believe Facebook hasn't provided enough details yet about Libra's technical aspects, like how it regards against money laundering, how much control would be exercised by other companies including PayPal. Bitcoin prices are sliding at the same time, your take on that?</p><p>BASENESE: Look, I went on-the-record, I think, last week saying I think Libra is going to be a flop, and Bitcoin is in desperate need of going to the French to the front line. Libra represented that opportunity for Bitcoin. But in the wake of what's happening, now all the scrutiny coming on Libra, I just don't think it's going to happen. You know, in the most likely scenario, now, we're going to look at, maybe capital controls put on Facebook for them to launch this, which really turns this cryptocurrency away from everything it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be unregulated, anonymous, so really therefore not much of a cryptocurrency, which is why I think we see bitcoin is trading in high correlation with Libra and that's why we're seeing selloff continue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, it's just specked of asset at this point, it's like trading, I don't know, rocks. You know, whatever value that these -- that speculators and gamblers want to assign to it, you know.</p><p>BASENESE: Rocks are more tangible than it, Dagen, come on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: But Libra was different, right? I mean, it's actually backed by hard assets, government securities -- I mean, you have to have a local bank account on Libra, or at least that was the plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, that's the plan but you have Facebook behind it, and they've got black eyes. They've got 50 black eyes in terms of not protecting people's privacy. Lou, thanks so much. Lou Basenese.</p><p>BASENESE: Thanks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump tweeting again this time on Democrats, we're going to run out of time because I can't talk fast enough to get through this; we will get to this at the top of the next hour, I promise you that, more of MORNINGS WITH MARIA when we come back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The number of people shopping on the app, Pinduoduo, has grown more than fivefold since the beginning of 2017, and its parent company is preparing to list shares on the Nasdaq, one of a wave of Chinese tech companies tapping international capital markets this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But by taking its business global, Pinduoduo has exposed itself to a new kind of stumbling block: a trademark infringement lawsuit in the United States.</p><p>The complaint, filed Thursday in a federal court in New York by a diaper maker called Daddy\u2019s Choice, says that Pinduoduo knowingly allowed the sale of knockoff products bearing the Daddy\u2019s Choice name. According to the suit, the e-commerce platform removed some of the unauthorized goods when Daddy\u2019s Choice, which is based in Beijing, first reported them last year. But the items quickly reappeared, and Pinduoduo took no action when notified of them again this year, the complaint says.</p><p>Lawyers for Daddy\u2019s Choice say in the complaint that they filed the suit in New York because American consumers are able to buy from Pinduoduo, and because Daddy\u2019s Choice has spent considerably to build its brand in the United States. Pinduoduo declined to comment.</p><p>China is the world\u2019s largest market for online retail, and giant companies and start-ups alike are competing to modernize the shopping experience. There are platforms catering to shoppers of every taste and persuasion, whether they want high-end imported wares or the latest in fast fashion. Heavyweights such as Alibaba and JD.com are experimenting with technologies such as facial recognition and drones to get people to buy more, and more often.</p><p>Even by the standards of China\u2019s buzzy tech scene, Pinduoduo\u2019s rise (its name is pronounced \u201cPING-daw-daw\u201d) has been extraordinarily rapid.</p><p>The three-year-old company says that nearly 350 million people shopped on its platform in the past year, which would most likely make it China\u2019s No. 2 e-commerce provider by that metric, behind only Alibaba. With its deep discounts on groceries, clothes, gadgets and knickknacks, the company has won over a vast, underserved population of online shoppers in China: older, less internet-savvy people living in smaller cities and the countryside.</p><p>But Pinduoduo has been dogged by accusations that its platform hosts sales of counterfeits, illegal goods or products that simply do not match their descriptions online.</p><p>In its filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Pinduoduo has said that it immediately removes unauthorized products or misleading information found on its platform, and that it freezes the accounts of merchants who violate its policies.

Such businesses stand to benefit as China continues to reduce its dependence on export-driven manufacturing, and instead relies more on domestic consumer spending to drive growth.</p><p>In particular, they say, investors should focus on the dynamic Chinese technology, internet and e-commerce companies that are likely to prosper from Beijing's greater emphasis on the quality of economic growth.</p><p>Already, the big surge in the Chinese sharemarket this year has been driven by big tech groups, such as e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and the messaging-and-gaming group Tencent Holdings, which are ranked in the top 10 most valuable tech companies in the world, alongside US giants such as Amazon.com and Facebook.</p><p>Analysts point out that China is already the world's largest e-commerce and mobile-payment market. Of China's roughly 750 million mobile-internet users, more than half use their smartphones to pay for products and services. Chinese mobile payments are estimated to have soared to about 60 trillion yuan ($11.7 trillion) last year, more than eight times the transaction volume of the US. But the surge in the power and reach of Chinese tech companies is not without political risks.</p><p>Analysts warn that as Chinese citizens use their phones for everything from texting to e-commerce and banking, tech companies are accumulating unparalleled amounts of information about their lives. And this is bound to arouse the interest of the Chinese Communist Party, which Xi wants to see play an even more central role in the country's affairs.</p><p>Beijing already requires big e-commerce groups to share their data with the Chinese central bank, which then shares the personal data of some 400 million people - including their payment history - with about 50 state-owned banks. Analysts say that, going forward, Chinese tech firms will likely face even greater pressure to work with Chinese authorities.</p><p>Beijing is already looking at ways to prevent these Chinese tech giants becoming too powerful. One possibility - which Chinese regulators have already flagged - would be for Beijing to take a 1 per cent stake in big tech companies such as Tencent and Weibo. This would give Beijing the right to appoint a government official to the companies' board to monitor, and perhaps even influence, their corporate decision-making.</p><p>Chinese authorities are also keen to harness the vibrancy and dynamism of their tech companies as they try to revitalise the lumbering state-owned sector. One way is to encourage more private investment in state-owned firms.</p><p>Two months ago, Chinese internet giants including Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba joined in a Beijing-backed plan to pump $US11.7 billion into the telecommunications giant China Unicom in what was billed as a template for revitalising Chinese state-owned companies.</p><p>Beijing is looking at ways to prevent Chinese tech giants becoming too powerful.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6xbm2ytbtwn23t4op63</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PV0-DXM1-F0J6-J32B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And I think having people hear the ideas of other people is important,\" he said.<br/><br/> The Stanford professor said that the annual conference, which has been held for the eighth time since it was started in 2012, has achieved its goal of maintaining relationships, friendships and understanding between the two sides.<br/><br/> The annual event, which rotates between China and the United States, normally touches upon the most pressing issues and challenges of that year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PDOENG-8635269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PDOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WBC-JY51-JC5R-251B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420303</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 People's Daily</copyright><publicationName>People's Daily Online - English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 13, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And I think having people hear the ideas of other people is important,\" he said.</p><p>The Stanford professor said that the annual conference, which has been held for the eighth time since it was started in 2012, has achieved its goal of maintaining relationships, friendships and understanding between the two sides.</p><p>The annual event, which rotates between China and the United States, normally touches upon the most pressing issues and challenges of that year.
