He was showing off a new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sign-in-with-apple-wwdc-2019-facebook-google-alternative-2019-6?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\"> app login feature</url>\u00a0designed specifically to limit Facebook and Google from tracking iPhone users' movements across their various apps.</p><p>At the very moment that Apple was preaching to its audience, a Reuters report crossed the wires with the latest developments in the federal government's effort to stiffen regulation of powerful \"Big Tech\" companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Google...and Apple.\u00a0</p><p>The timing was purely coincidental, but it highlighted a development that's likely to blunt Apple's weapon of choice against its rivals, and, if Apple isn't careful, could backfire on Apple itself. By limiting access to user data, Apple risks irritating not only Google and Facebook, but many of the thousands of smaller developers who build apps for its devices. The move could also unintentionally create the perception that Apple is thwarting competition and needs to be reined in.</p><h>Apple is broadening its privacy crusade</h><p>Apple has been promoting itself as a protector of privacy for years now, using its pro-privacy image as a way to differentiate itself from other big tech companies, particularly Facebook and Google.</p><p>To Apple's credit, this is not all just public relations. The company has repeatedly added features to its devices and services that are designed to make them more secure and to help users protect their personal information. It has built features into its products that encrypt the data stored on them and the messages sent through them. It has designed some of its artificial-intelligence features to analyze information on users' devices rather than on servers in the cloud to help protect their sensitive data. And it has taken steps to anonymize data that is sent to its servers to make it more difficult to identify individual users.\u00a0</p><p>At Apple's developers conference, company officials made clear that they've been thinking even more expansively about privacy. Among the things they announced were:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A new app for Apple Watch called Cycle Tracking that's designed to allow women to keep tabs on their menstrual cycles. As with Apple's other health-related apps, users decide if or when they want to share data from it. The announcement of the new app follows a report that a similar third-party app - Flo Health's Flo Period &amp; Ovulation Tracker - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-sensitive-data-apps-2019-2?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">was sharing information about users' cycles with Facebook</url>.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A new feature in HomeKit, Apple's smart home technology, that will require security cameras to analyze video on users' own devices. Today, many services send such data, which can include video inside consumers' homes, up to cloud services to be processed.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Another new feature in HomeKit that's designed for home routers. The feature will cordon off smart home devices attached to those routers, preventing them from being used to access other part of the network. There have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vint-cerf-sees-big-danger-internet-of-things-2019-1?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">growing concerns</url> about the security of smarthome devices and there have been several notable incidents where hackers have gotten control of groups of such gadgets.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A new privacy setting in iOS, the operating system underlying the iPhone, that allows users to allow apps to access their location \"only once.\" That move would force apps to seek users' approval each and every time the apps want to know users' location. Previously, users had more limited options for controlling access to their location.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A new feature that will block apps from trying to route around such privacy limitations by using phones' Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios to scan for nearby transmitters. A report last year laid out how F<url normalizedValue=\"https://bgr.com/2018/12/19/facebook-location-tracking-features-how-facebook-tracks-you-for-ads/\">acebook was using such data to\u00a0 determine users' locations</url> even when they had chosen in their settings to block its app from knowing their locations.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A new \"log in with Apple\" option for apps. The feature is designed to be an alternative to the commonly used alternatives from Facebook and Google. Unlike those systems, Apple's wouldn't be used to track users across apps. And Apple would allow users to set up one-time-use email addresses to go with the log in to further protect their privacy.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><h>The new features may get a mixed reaction</h><p>Many consumers are likely to cheer such features. There's been growing concern not only about the amount of data that Facebook, Google, and other big tech companies collect, but also about how that data is being used. Facebook, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/5-billion-ftc-fine-wont-change-facebook-practices-2019-4?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">faces a multi-billion dollar fine</url> for the leaking of user data to Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica last year. And both companies have come under repeated fire for using the data they have on consumers and their online activities and using that information to manipulate them into spending greater amounts of their time with the companies' services.</p><p>But as much as consumers may appreciate such features, developers may hate them. Tech companies typically collect information on users' whereabouts and their online habits in order to more precisely target them with advertisements. Facebook and Google are the biggest players in digital advertising, but they are far from the only ones. And in many cases, app developers team up with Facebook and Google and share in both the data collection and the advertising dollars.\u00a0</p><p>Allowing consumers to limit location tracking or tracking across apps may in turn curtail the advertising revenue such ads generate. That could lead some developers to abandon iOS or to charge for their apps and services rather than offering them as ad-supported ones. And fewer apps overall or fewer ad-supported ones could make the iPhone less attractive to end users.</p><p>But Apple's announcements run other risks for the company. The Cycle Tracking app takes aim at a whole class of applications that have cropped up to allow users to track their menstrual cycles. The move represents only the latest time that the company has launched a service that offers a function that many users previously got from a third-party app. As in past cases, Apple's app will get preferential treatment in iOS; unlike rival period trackers, Apple's will be built right into its Health app on the iPhone.\u00a0</p><h>Apple is coming under increased scrutiny</h><p>The announcement comes as Apple is already drawing flack for such practices. Spotify<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-complaint-against-apple-what-it-means-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">has complained to European Union competition authorities</url> that Apple has given its Apple Music service unfair advantages over Spotify's service. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren, highlighting such complaints,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-break-up-apple-over-antitrust-concerns-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">has argued that Apple ought not be able to operate an app store for third-party developers</url> and offer apps that compete with those in its store.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read this: </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-complaint-against-apple-what-it-means-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Spotify just painted a big target on Apple's back, and the iPhone maker should worry if antitrust regulators start aiming at it</url></p><p>But Apple could face the biggest problem with its new sign-on service. It reportedly will require any app that offers a third-party login feature to offer Apple's sign-on service as well.</p><p>That requirement seems like a prime example of what's called tying, which is where a company in a dominant position requires partners who want to use one service or feature to use another one as well. The tying of its Internet Explorer browser to Windows is what got Microsoft in trouble with antitrust authorities 20 years ago. The tying of the Google search and other apps to Google Play and Android is what got Google in trouble with the European Union more recently and led to a $5 billion fine.</p><p>News of that requirement came on the same day as reports that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-oversight-apple-potential-antitrust-probe-2019-6?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">US antitrust authorities are starting to look at Apple</url>. The company may well regret that timing.</p><p>The problem for Apple is that even as people have become more concerned about privacy, they've been increasingly worried about the power of the Big Tech companies. Even when it's doing something that's ostensibly in the interests of consumers, it's going to be scrutinized. And maybe penalized too.\u00a0</p><p>That's why Apple's pro-privacy stance could soon prove painful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Got a tip about Apple or the tech industry?

Consumers are likely to cheer many of the features, which are designed to help them protect their sensitive personal information. But the new features could hurt Apple by alienating developers. And some of them could add fuel to charges that the company is thwarting competition. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[4]. If you've been paying attention to Apple over the past year, you probably weren't surprised to see it tout its privacy bona fides at its annual developers conference on Monday, or to see it gleefully disparage the failings of other tech companies. Privacy has been a smart strategy for Apple lately, dovetailing nicely with the hardware maker's own push into internet services and the public outcry over Google and Facebook's shoddy privacy track records. \"We believe privacy is a fundamental human right,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, proclaimed on stage. He was showing off a new app login feature[5]designed specifically to limit Facebook and Google from tracking iPhone users' movements across their various apps. At the very moment that Apple was preaching to its audience, a Reuters report crossed the wires with the latest developments in the federal government's effort to stiffen regulation of powerful \"Big Tech\" companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Google...and Apple. The timing was purely coincidental, but it highlighted a development that's likely to blunt Apple's weapon of choice against its rivals, and, if Apple isn't careful, could backfire on Apple itself. By limiting access to user data, Apple risks irritating not only Google and Facebook, but many of the thousands of smaller developers who build apps for its devices. The move could also unintentionally create the perception that Apple is thwarting competition and needs to be reined in.Apple is broadening its privacy crusadeApple has been promoting itself as a protector of privacy for years now, using its pro-privacy image as a way to differentiate itself from other big tech companies, particularly Facebook and Google. To Apple's credit, this is not all just public relations. The company has repeatedly added features to its devices and services that are designed to make them more secure and to help users protect their personal information. It has built features into its products that encrypt the data stored on them and the messages sent through them. It has designed some of its artificial-intelligence features to analyze information on users' devices rather than on servers in the cloud to help protect their sensitive data. And it has taken steps to anonymize data that is sent to its servers to make it more difficult to identify individual users. At Apple's developers conference, company officials made clear that they've been thinking even more expansively about privacy. Among the things they announced were: A new app for Apple Watch called Cycle Tracking that's designed to allow women to keep tabs on their menstrual cycles. As with Apple's other health-related apps, users decide if or when they want to share data from it. The announcement of the new app follows a report that a similar third-party app \u2014 Flo Health's Flo Period ...ulation Tracker \u2014 was sharing information about users' cycles with Facebook[6]. A new feature in HomeKit, Apple's smart home technology, that will require security cameras to analyze video on users' own devices. Today, many services send such data, which can include video inside consumers' homes, up to cloud services to be processed. Another new feature in HomeKit that's designed for home routers. The feature will cordon off smart home devices attached to those routers, preventing them from being used to access other part of the network. There have been growing concerns[7] about the security of smarthome devices and there have been several notable incidents where hackers have gotten control of groups of such gadgets. A new privacy setting in iOS, the operating system underlying the iPhone, that allows users to allow apps to access their location \"only once.\" That move would force apps to seek users' approval each and every time the apps want to know users' location. Previously, users had more limited options for controlling access to their location. A new feature that will block apps from trying to route around such privacy limitations by using phones' Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios to scan for nearby transmitters. A report last year laid out how Facebook was using such data to determine users' locations[8] even when they had chosen in their settings to block its app from knowing their locations. A new \"log in with Apple\" option for apps. The feature is designed to be an alternative to the commonly used alternatives from Facebook and Google. Unlike those systems, Apple's wouldn't be used to track users across apps. And Apple would allow users to set up one-time-use email addresses to go with the log in to further protect their privacy.The new features may get a mixed reactionMany consumers are likely to cheer such features. There's been growing concern not only about the amount of data that Facebook, Google, and other big tech companies collect, but also about how that data is being used. Facebook, for example, faces a multi-billion dollar fine[9] for the leaking of user data to Trump-linked data firm Cambridge Analytica last year. And both companies have come under repeated fire for using the data they have on consumers and their online activities and using that information to manipulate them into spending greater amounts of their time with the companies' services. But as much as consumers may appreciate such features, developers may hate them. Tech companies typically collect information on users' whereabouts and their online habits in order to more precisely target them with advertisements. Facebook and Google are the biggest players in digital advertising, but they are far from the only ones. And in many cases, app developers team up with Facebook and Google and share in both the data collection and the advertising dollars. Allowing consumers to limit location tracking or tracking across apps may in turn curtail the advertising revenue such ads generate. That could lead some developers to abandon iOS or to charge for their apps and services rather than offering them as ad-supported ones. And fewer apps overall or fewer ad-supported ones could make the iPhone less attractive to end users. But Apple's announcements run other risks for the company. The Cycle Tracking app takes aim at a whole class of applications that have cropped up to allow users to track their menstrual cycles. The move represents only the latest time that the company has launched a service that offers a function that many users previously got from a third-party app. As in past cases, Apple's app will get preferential treatment in iOS; unlike rival period trackers, Apple's will be built right into its Health app on the iPhone.Apple is coming under increased scrutinyThe announcement comes as Apple is already drawing flack for such practices. Spotify has complained to European Union competition authorities[10] that Apple has given its Apple Music service unfair advantages over Spotify's service. Meanwhile, Senator Elizabeth Warren, highlighting such complaints, has argued that Apple ought not be able to operate an app store for third-party developers[11] and offer apps that compete with those in its store. Read this: Spotify just painted a big target on Apple's back, and the iPhone maker should worry if antitrust regulators start aiming at it[12] But Apple could face the biggest problem with its new sign-on service. It reportedly will require any app that offers a third-party login feature to offer Apple's sign-on service as well. That requirement seems like a prime example of what's called tying, which is where a company in a dominant position requires partners who want to use one service or feature to use another one as well. The tying of its Internet Explorer browser to Windows is what got Microsoft in trouble with antitrust authorities 20 years ago. The tying of the Google search and other apps to Google Play and Android is what got Google in trouble with the European Union more recently and led to a $5 billion fine. News of that requirement came on the same day as reports that US antitrust authorities are starting to look at Apple[13]. The company may well regret that timing. The problem for Apple is that even as people have become more concerned about privacy, they've been increasingly worried about the power of the Big Tech companies. Even when it's doing something that's ostensibly in the interests of consumers, it's going to be scrutinized. And maybe penalized too. That's why Apple's pro-privacy stance could soon prove painful.

(And, together with Google, it is also the focus of an ACCC enquiry into digital platforms).</p><p>Not only is it being investigated by governments around the world, it now has the world's most valuable company throwing shade at it.</p><p>Apple was also among the handset makers named in the original New York Times report, but it has denied seeking any data from Facebook (and Facebook said the arrangements were tightly controlled and not abused by anyone involved, anyway).</p><p>The iPhone maker has espoused an unwavering commitment to privacy throughout its existence - to the extent that it was once in a bitter <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/apple-wins-in-fbi-fight-but-iphone-security-loses-20160330-gntnlw.html\">dispute with the FBI</url> over encryption.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/06/04/616280585/apple-requested-zero-personal-data-in-deals-with-facebook-ceo-tim-cook-says\">media interviews</url> this week Apple CEO Tim Cook talked up his company's privacy credentials, and his disdain for the cavalier approach of other tech companies (i.e Facebook and Google) on data collection was unmistakeable.</p><p>Apple doesn't meaningfully compete with Facebook, although once tech companies get to a certain size they are all potential rivals (for talent, at the very least).</p><p>That Apple took a public stand against Facebook shows it knows privacy issues are important to its users. And critical for its business.</p><p>On the other hand, data collection is absolutely critical to Facebook, so its an impasse that won't be easily resolved.</p><p>Apple hasn't been afraid to publicly criticise rival tech companies in the past.</p><p>Steve Jobs' contempt for Google in general, and towards Adobe (for its Flash software) was legendary.

Hey creators said Apple was forcing it to recategorize its $99 annual subscription fee as an in-app purchase in order to take a cut of the profits.Apple doubled down in an email to Hey creators Thursday, saying the app would remain banned from the App Store until Hey reclassifies its $99 subscription fee as an in-app purchase.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Despite a public backlash from app developers, Apple isn't backing down on its controversial policy of siphoning up to 30% of revenue from apps that appear in Apple's App Store.The tech giant was the target of heated criticism this week from Basecamp, an app maker that just released a new email app called Hey. Users of Hey must pay a $99 subscription fee, but the app initially guided users to make that payment outside the app to avoid Apple taking a commission. </p><p>Apple banned Hey from its App Store as a result.On Thursday, Apple doubled down on its policy. The company said in an email to Hey's creators that it would have to retool the app to let people buy subscriptions in-app before Apple would let it back into the App Store. The email was first reported by NBC News[2].\"We understand that Basecamp has developed a number of apps and many subsequent versions for the App Store for many years, and that the App Store has distributed millions of these apps to iOS users,\" the email reads.Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson criticized Apple's decision in a tweet Thursday, calling the email \"just more edicts from the monopoly king.\" \u2014DHH (@dhh) June 18, 2020[3] An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Apple 's App Store has drawn scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers, who have criticized it as a monopoly where Apple can punish competitors without retribution. Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the House Antitrust Subcommittee, told The Verge[4] Thursday that Apple's commission amounts to \"highway robbery.\" Apple is the defendant in a lawsuit filed by two app developers[5] over its App Store policy enforcement.

Spotify Technology SA already complained to antitrust regulators that Apple favours its own music service. Now banks and other payments providers say the company gives its Apple Pay service an unfair advantage by limiting access to a key component inside iPhones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Access to technical interfaces is now a key competitive factor for payment systems,\" Kerstin Altendorf, a spokeswoman for the Association of German Banks, said. \"The same conditions should apply to all market participants.\"</p><p>The arguments levelled at Apple come as lawmakers and regulators look to curb the power of Silicon Valley technology platforms, including Google and Facebook Inc.</p><p>European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager has begun scrutinizing Apple Pay, and antitrust regulators in the Netherlands and France are concerned, too. In Germany, a law that kicks in Jan. 1 could force Apple to open up its payments technology more for competitors.</p><p>This is all bad timing for Apple, which is relying more on digital services like Apple Pay to generate growth. Its digital wallet is linked with 900 banks in Europe already and the company plans to work with another 1,500. How well that goes will partly depend on the fight for access to Apple Pay tech.</p><p>Vestager's officials have sought industry feedback on how iPhones may favor Apple Pay over other payment solutions. While that hasn't triggered a formal probe yet, Vestager said she's heard \"many, many concerns\" over the service and how that might hamper competition for easy payments.</p><p>Bad blood between Vestager and Apple won't help either. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called one of Vestager's decisions \"political crap\" when the EU ordered Apple to pay Ireland 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes.</p><p>And Vestager's concerns about Apple Pay are echoed by other antitrust regulators in the region. France's antitrust regulator has warned about new entrants to quickly gaining dominant positions, and the Dutch regulator in October launched a market study to analyze the impact of big tech firms on its payments market.</p><p>Germany is on the front lines of this battle. A law, kicking in Jan. 1, requires operators of digital money infrastructure to open up access to competitors for a reasonable fee. While Apple isn't mentioned in the law, the company may be most exposed because Apple Pay relies on the iPhone's near-field communications chip for slick in-store payments.</p><p>Wireless payments are powered by so-called NFC chips, that let thousands use their phones to pour through subway ticket gates in London and Tokyo. The component also handles the wireless signals that allow Apple Pay users to wave their phones at store terminals for instant charges to a credit or debit card. Banks want the same functionality for their own iPhone apps and complain that Apple won't give them access to the chip.</p><p>Germany could force Apple's hand. The new law requires \"non-discriminatory access to the technical infrastructure\" said Altendorf, the spokeswoman for the German bank association. That's a step in the right direction, she added.</p><p>Apple has already had to make changes to Apple Pay in response to an antitrust complaint in Europe. Swiss mobile payment app Twint contacted regulators because Apple's wallet app kept automatically launching when customers tried to use Twint's QR-based app at payment terminals. Apple last December agreed to implement a technical solution, deactivating NFC when the Twint app is open to stop Apple Pay interfering with its competitor's service.</p><p>Apple says it restricts access to the iPhone's NFC chip as part of a system that encrypts users' card information. Allowing competing mobile payments apps to access the NFC chip decoupled from Apple's added layer of security could increase the risk of fraud and other security breaches, it said.</p><p>Apple believes \"deeply in competition,\" it said in a statement, and the company has tried to make the service \"the kind of seamless and convenient payment and wallet system that our users want and expect.\"</p><p>Customers can also still use alternative mobile payment options on Apple devices where transactions are processed through black-and-white QR codes instead of NFC technology.</p><p>Security concerns may scupper these QR-based alternatives, which are used by Twint, Payconiq International SA and other Apple Pay rivals.</p><p>QR codes can be easily spoofed, according to James Moar, an analyst at Juniper Research. \"I don't really see that as viable competition to Apple Pay in Europe at this point,\" he said.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

On Tuesday, the US government said that it was probing whether Google broke privacy laws on healthcare data in a cloud computing project with Ascension, the country's second-largest healthcare system, after a report in the Wall Street Journal. Google said it had complied with the regulations.</p><p>Apple has increasingly been looking at ways to encourage activity and monitor health, with chief executive Tim Cook saying that in the future it would become clear that the company's 'greatest contribution to mankind' will be in healthcare.</p><p>The company is hoping it can differentiate itself from rivals thanks to its nearly 1bn iPhone users - and a 'privacy first' business model that is not reliant on advertising.</p><p>The new app declares that 'privacy is a fundamental human right'. It allows users to control whether they participate, which studies they join, and stay informed about the results. The app says no data will be sold to third parties.</p><p>The push follows the 2014 launch of ResearchKit, an open-source platform that lets researchers recruit participants for a wide array of studies. The best known is Apple's 'heart study', a Stanford-led research project that identified irregular heart rhythms using data from more than 400,000 users of the Apple Watch.</p><p>Three research projects launching on Thursday will study women's health, heart and movement, and hearing.

On Tuesday, the US government said that it was probing whether Google broke privacy laws on healthcare data in a cloud computing project with Ascension, the country\u2019s second-largest healthcare system, after a report in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-googles-project-nightingale-a-health-data-gold-mine-of-50-million-patients-11573571867\"> the Wall Street Journal</url>. Google said it had complied with the regulations.</p><p>Apple has increasingly been looking at ways to encourage activity and monitor health, with chief executive Tim Cook saying that in the future it would become clear that the company\u2019s \u201cgreatest contribution to mankind\u201d will be in healthcare.</p><p>The company is hoping it can differentiate itself from rivals thanks to its nearly 1bn iPhone users \u2014 and a \u201cprivacy first\u201d business model that is not reliant on advertising.</p><p>The new app declares that \u201cprivacy is a fundamental human right\u201d. It allows users to control whether they participate, which studies they join, and stay informed about the results. The app says no data will be sold to third parties.</p><p>Big tech and personal data</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">See below more coverage of the evolving relationship between tech companies and consumers\u2019 personal information</emphasis></p><p>Health websites are sharing sensitive data with advertisers<br/>FT investigation reveals symptoms and drug names shared with hundreds of third parties</p><p>Google to limit advertiser\u2019s access to user data<br/>Publishers warn that move could further entrench search group\u2019s dominance</p><p>Google in talks to move into banking<br/>Group\u2019s interest comes after steps by Apple and Facebook into financial services</p><p>The push follows the 2014 launch of ResearchKit, an open-source platform that lets researchers recruit participants for a wide array of studies. The best known is Apple's \u201cheart study\u201d, a Stanford-led research project that identified irregular heart rhythms using data from more than 400,000 users of the Apple Watch.</p><p>Three research projects launching on Thursday will study women\u2019s health, heart and movement, and hearing.

In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly. The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple's car initiative. </p><p>The company has added resources to the project -- code-named Titan -- over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort. MIT Technology Review[2]:\u00a0Self-Driving Cars Can Learn a Lot by Playing Grand Theft Auto Spending thousands of hours playing Grand Theft Auto might have questionable benefits for humans, but it could help make computers significantly more intelligent. Several research groups are now using the hugely popular game, which features fast cars and various nefarious activities, to train algorithms that might enable a self-driving car to navigate a real road. There's little chance of a computer learning bad behavior by playing violent computer games. But the stunningly realistic scenery found in Grand Theft Auto and other virtual worlds could help a machine perceive elements of the real world correctly. The Globe and Mail[3]: Vancouver Company Unveils Three-Wheeled Electric Car A three-wheeled electric vehicle could be on the road later this year in Canada and the U.S. Electra Meccanica Vehicles Corp. of Vancouver officially unveiled the one-seat Solo on Friday. The Solo could go on sale as early as November pending approval by U.S. and Canadian regulators. It costs around $15,500. Two hundred people have already put down a refundable deposit of 250 Canadian dollars ($193) to get the Solo, Electra Meccanica spokesperson Jeff Holland said. Those who put down deposits now can expect delivery after the first quarter of 2017. The company eventually hopes to sell the Solo globally. Guardian[4]: How an Abandoned Gold Mine Will Be Converted Into a World First Gold was discovered on the Copperfield river in northwestern Queensland in 1907. As men flocked to find their fortune, a small township was established and named for the state's then premier, William Kidston. For close to 100 years, Kidston was a mining town. But, in 2001, the largest operation -- a Canadian-owned goldmine -- shut down. The site became another of the roughly 50,000 'orphaned' mines littered across Australia. Today, the site is coincidentally in the custody of the great-great-grandson of the former Queensland premier. Simon Kidston is the executive director of Genex, an ASX-listed company with plans to reuse the massive craters on site for a world-first pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) system, combined with an integrated solar farm.

Its market capitalisation has reached $1 trillion, reinforcing its position as the world's largest business and cementing the shift from heavy industry to technology and innovation that has been under way over the past decade.</p><p>Apple is not the first company to top the $1 trillion mark. PetroChina crossed that mark shortly after its market debut in 2007. Following a spectacular collapse, it now has a market capitalisation of under $200bn. Its performance has been described by Bloomberg as &amp; the biggest stock slump in world history&amp; The possibility of Apple experiencing such a collapse is remote, not least because it has built its value on real-world sales of devices and services. It, along with Amazon, is in the vanguard of the change in the way the world lives and transacts.</p><p>It is not without significance that Apple's milestone comes a month after General Electric suffered the ignominy of being removed from the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average index. After more than 100 years on the Dow, GE was no longer considered an appropriate member of the benchmark against which the performance of US stocks is measured.</p><p>In the words of David Blitzer of S&amp; P Dow Jones Indices, dumping GE &amp; will make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market&amp; This trend has been under way for some time. Apple itself replaced another industrial behemoth, AT&amp; T, on the index.</p><p>The shift from industrial production to technological innovation led to the phenomenon of the &amp; FAANGs&amp; Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - being identified as high-growth stocks of the future.

Its market capitalisation has reached $1 trillion, reinforcing its position as the world's largest business and cementing the shift from heavy industry to technology and innovation that has been under way over the past decade.</p><p>Apple is not the first company to top the $1 trillion mark. PetroChina crossed that mark shortly after its market debut in 2007. Following a spectacular collapse, it now has a market capitalisation of under $200bn. Its performance has been described by Bloomberg as &amp; the biggest stock slump in world history&amp; The possibility of Apple experiencing such a collapse is remote, not least because it has built its value on real-world sales of devices and services. It, along with Amazon, is in the vanguard of the change in the way the world lives and transacts.</p><p>It is not without significance that Apple's milestone comes a month after General Electric suffered the ignominy of being removed from the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average index. After more than 100 years on the Dow, GE was no longer considered an appropriate member of the benchmark against which the performance of US stocks is measured.</p><p>In the words of David Blitzer of S&amp; P Dow Jones Indices, dumping GE &amp; will make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market&amp; This trend has been under way for some time. Apple itself replaced another industrial behemoth, AT&amp; T, on the index.</p><p>The shift from industrial production to technological innovation led to the phenomenon of the &amp; FAANGs&amp; Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - being identified as high-growth stocks of the future. But as with any disruption, the moment comes when innovation must be backed up by finan-cial performance.</p><p>The FAANGs may finally be losing their lustre. Facebook has advised that its revenue will drop as it succumbs to greater regulation following scandals over how it sold private information to third parties who used it for political ends. Even the market's darling, Netflix, has been rerated, with investors wondering how much longer it can burn through mountains of cash to fund its ambitious content offering.</p><p>Even as Apple becomes the mother of all businesses, some cracks are beginning to show. It invented the device that has changed everything - the modern touch-screen app-driven smartphone - but is now in third place to Samsung and Huawei when it comes to unit sales of handsets.</p><p>What Apple has on its side is the golden stream of annuity income it gets from subscriptions to its services as millions pay a monthly fee to use the cloud or stream music. It may sell fewer phones, but the average price paid for an Apple phone is significantly higher. All of this has combined to boost the company to record revenue and investors have responded by backing the stock, which was up more than 5% the day after it announced its recent quarterly results.</p><p>Market watchers are saying it is time to dump Facebook and Netflix and forget about FAANGs. Instead, they say, investors should be focused on MAGA - Microsoft, Apple, Google and Amazon - which have businesses grounded in solid earnings. What the world must now grapple with is how these behemoth tech companies are changing the way in which information is moved and manipulated.</p><p>While Facebook has been the fall guy, all the big tech companies have become extremely powerful. Apple's market capitalisation is now three times the size of SA's GDP, which stands at $349bn for 2017. Even on the more generous &amp; purchasing power parity&amp; definition of GDP at $765bn, Apple is bigger than the country's GDP. The power to lobby to influence the regulatory environment is immense, as is the challenge facing new companies wanting to compete for their audiences.</p><p>SA should guard against the crushing of local technological innovation and the flight of talent as it struggles to compete in a world dominated by the fourth industrial revolution.</p><p>APPLE'S MARKET CAPITALISATION IS NOW THREE TIMES THE SIZE OFSA'S GDP</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLBD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLBD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T0H-9021-DYT4-K14X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

In the letter Cook famously noted, \"A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you're not the customer, you're the product.\" Cook was mostly looking to contrast the business model of Apple, which involves mostly making money on device sales, versus that of\u00a0Alphabet ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-c-shares/goog</url>) NASDAQ:GOOG ) ((      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/alphabet-a-shares/googl</url>) NASDAQ:GOOGL ), which often sells devices at breakeven to make money from advertising and data collection.</p><p>However, Cook drew the ire of\u00a0Facebook's\u00a0((<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/facebook/fb\">https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/facebook/fb</url>) NASDAQ:FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who responded in an interview with\u00a0Time\u00a0magazine. Without mentioning Cook by name, Facebook's CEO responded, \"A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers.\"</p><p>Apple may be the company most suited to benefit from Facebook's data-sharing scandal.</p><p>Facebook Has A Lot\u00a0Of Data On Android Users... And I Mean A Lot</p><p>Facebook's been in the news recently concerning its lax data sharing policies. To quickly recap, in 2015 the company allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data for approximately 50 million users via an app downloaded by approximately 270,000 people. The remainder did not give Cambridge Analytica permission, and many people are upset upon learning the\u00a0(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/27/is-it-safe-to-buy-facebook-inc-again.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/27/is-it-safe-to-buy-facebook-inc-again.aspx</url>) data was used to form psychological profiles to influence elections , both in the U.S. and abroad.</p><p>The recent Facebook scandal may be even worse for the company. For Android-based users with the Facebook app, the company has a file that includes nearly every phone call and text message you've fired off on your phone. Due to Cook's stronger privacy stance, as noted above, Facebook does not have this information for iOS users.</p><p>Apple Could Be The Biggest Winner</p><p>It's likely the market will bifurcate on this issue and benefit Apple's stock both directly and indirectly, but the extent is unclear. For the former, it is my opinion Apple will minorly benefit as security will become more important to a small subset of smartphone shoppers, many of whom will defect from Alphabet's Android to Apple or will more firmly lock them into the iOS ecosystem. It's likely most people will not change their behavior or limit their data.</p><p>Indirectly, it could help Apple with relative valuations. In the oft-discussed \"(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/29/ask-a-fool-what-are-the-fang-stocks.aspx\">https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/09/29/ask-a-fool-what-are-the-fang-stocks.aspx</url>) FANG \" cohort, Apple (alongside\u00a0 Netflix ) are the two companies less affected by the debate on data usage and collection.

In 2014,Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL[2]) CEO Tim Cook penned a missive regarding Apple's approach to privacy. In the letter Cook famously noted, \"A few years ago, users of Internet services began to realize that when an online service is free, you're not the customer, you're the product.\" </p><p>Cook was mostly looking to contrast the business model of Apple, which involves mostly making money on device sales, versus that ofAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG[3]) (NASDAQ:GOOGL[4]), which often sells devices at breakeven to make money from advertising and data collection. However, Cook drew the ire ofFacebook's(NASDAQ:FB[5]) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who responded in an interview withTimemagazine. Without mentioning Cook by name, Facebook's CEO responded, \"A frustration I have is that a lot of people increasingly seem to equate an advertising business model with somehow being out of alignment with your customers.\" Apple may be the company most suited to benefit from Facebook's data-sharing scandal.Facebook Has A LotOf Data On Android Users... And I Mean A LotFacebook's been in the news recently concerning its lax data sharing policies. To quickly recap, in 2015 the company allowed Cambridge Analytica to access data for approximately 50 million users via an app downloaded by approximately 270,000 people. The remainder did not give Cambridge Analytica permission, and many people are upset upon learning thedata was used to form psychological profiles to influence elections[6], both in the U.S. and abroad. The recent Facebook scandal may be even worse for the company. For Android-based users with the Facebook app, the company has a file that includes nearly every phone call and text message you've fired off on your phone. Due to Cook's stronger privacy stance, as noted above, Facebook does not have this information for iOS users.Apple Could Be The Biggest WinnerIt's likely the market will bifurcate on this issue and benefit Apple's stock both directly and indirectly, but the extent is unclear. For the former, it is my opinion Apple will minorly benefit as security will become more important to a small subset of smartphone shoppers, many of whom will defect from Alphabet's Android to Apple or will more firmly lock them into the iOS ecosystem. It's likely most people will not change their behavior or limit their data. Indirectly, it could help Apple with relative valuations. In the oft-discussed \"FANG[7]\" cohort, Apple (alongside Netflix ) are the two companies less affected by the debate on data usage and collection. Wholesale changes in consumer sentiment and increased regulation should affect these two companies to a lesser extent. At 13 times forward earnings,Apple already suffers from the lowest relative valuations within the cohort[8], and is even lower than the greater S...00's multiple of 17 times, so any multiple expansion would be welcomed. For Apple investors, it's likely Facebook's data struggles are not a thesis-altering event. However, it's likely data concerns will become more important in the future and Apple is in a safer position than many other big tech companies.

Apple may be in the mix.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Northern Virginia is one of 20 finalists for Amazon's second headquarters, and the region has invited Apple to consider it for a 20,000-person campus the iPhone maker is planning for somewhere in the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple is seeking 4 million square feet of office space, economic development officials and real estate executives told The Washington Post. That's about half as large as the campus Amazon is planning. Apple is also said to be exploring North Carolina's Research Triangle region, another possible Amazon location.</p><p>These twin tech \"trophy\" deals, the two largest in U.S. history, would be a boon for Northern Virginia, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First. Apple, in particular, offers high-wage jobs which could sprinkle prosperity on the region.</p><p>\"These are enormous standalone growth projects,\" he said.</p><p>Apple announced in January that it would spend $30 billion on new facilities and hire 20,000 employees in the U.S. over the next five years, setting off feverish speculation of where it would land. Unlike Amazon, Apple has not made its search public. CEO Tim Cook said in a recent interview that Apple was not engaged in a \"beauty contest kind of thing.\"</p><p>Apple declined to comment on the report in The Washington Post.</p><p>The gravitational pull for West Coast technology companies to the D.C. region: a young, highly educated and tech savvy workforce, nearby colleges, universities and research institutions and easy access to mass transit, not to mention greater proximity to a Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration, an added benefit given growing calls for regulation of the industry.</p><p>\"It is akin to what the defense industry did in the 1990s and early 2000s when it moved headquarters and facilities to be closer in touch with the people who use its products,\" said Tom Stringer, a corporate location specialist and managing director at BDO International. \"Big tech companies, as big and diversified as they have gotten and as many regulatory areas they now fall under, are starting to take the same approach.\"</p><p>But could Northern Virginia, a region already straining from overcrowding and traffic congestion, accommodate both tech giants?</p><p>\"If both were to come to Northern Virginia, that would be a very stressful event,\" LeRoy said. \"You'd have to rebuild the economic geography of Northern Virginia.\"</p><p>Word leaked Wednesday that Apple was considering a Northern Virginia campus that would be two-thirds the size of the Pentagon.</p><p>Some of the locations said to be under consideration -- office buildings and development sites in Crystal City, privately owned Loudoun County land near the Center for Innovative Technology and the Scotts Run development in Tysons -- have also been proposed for Amazon.</p><p>Another area catching Apple's eye: North Carolina's Research Triangle, close to Duke University, where Cook and other Apple executives went to school, the Triangle Business Journal reported. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper and state Commerce Secretary Tony Copeland met with Cook on May 11, according to the report. Cook was in town to give a commencement speech at Duke University on May 13.</p><p>\"We do not share information about economic development projects before they are final, but I will be happy to share more information if or when a decision is made,\" Jamal Little, the North Carolina governor's spokesman, said in an emailed statement.</p><p>Northern Virginia is home to an established \"technology corridor\" near Dulles International Airport that was dubbed the \"Silicon Valley of the East\" four years ago by The Atlantic magazine. The region's proximity to the federal government makes it attractive to defense, tech, telecom and Internet companies. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-99928101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBK-KMB1-DYRR-91MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gannett Company, Inc.

The Apple chief executive paid a surprise visit to Eldim, a Normandy-based firm that develops optical technology used in the facial recognition system inside new top-of-the-range iPhone X smartphones due out next month. Prices start at US$999. Face ID, as the iPhone X feature is known, will replace the fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone and features in Apple's campaign to distinguish the phone from rival devices. </p><p>\"Bravo for your work!\", Cook said on his official Twitter account in French. A picture of him chatting with Eldim employees was also posted. Cook later met Macron, who has called for Apple and other tech companies such as Amazon.com to pay more in taxes in Europe. \"Bravo to Europe for acting with determination to get tax rules and justice respected,\" Macron said in a tweet last week praising European Union officials for taking member-state Ireland to court to reclaim 13 billion euros (US$15.3 billion) in back taxes from Apple. CONSTRUCTIVE TALKS A French presidency official said Macron and Cook did not rake over the past and described the talks about regulating digital platforms and tax policy as constructive and forward-looking.

This wasn't a posturing competition.\" Eldim, located outside Caen, near the northern coast of France, had worked with Apple on research projects for nearly a decade before gaining recognition for its optical work on behalf of Apple, the world's most highly valued company. \"They (Eldim) certainly have a top-notch technology,\" said industry analyst Thomas Husson of Forrester Research. \"Facial recognition is one of iPhone X's differentiating features.\" Apple is normally highly secretive about the suppliers it uses to develop new phones, computers and other devices. A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics , one of Europe's larger technology companies, is widely understood to be a supplier of sensors for the Apple iPhone 7 and forthcoming iPhone devices, but is barred by Apple from saying so.

This trust factor showed up in a recent poll taken following the highly publicized legal battle between Apple and the U.S. Justice Department began.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Justice officials asked Apple to de-encrypt an iPhone used by a terrorist. Apple has refused to do so, becoming a Silicon Valley hero, billing itself as a defender of the private sector and privacy.</p><p>The tussle ended, perhaps temporarily, when Justice officials announced this week that a hacker has approached them who knows how to de-encrypt the phone.</p><p>I hope it works because it would serve Apple right. The company's stance was not heroic, it was commercial based on marketing promises that its phones were secure and no one could ever get into one.</p><p>Now Apple not only looks like a bad corporate citizen for balking at helping a terrorist investigation, but its brand will be harmed after the phone is hacked.</p><p>The best solution would have been a compromise: Apple should have made a deal with Justice in the face of evidence of wrongdoing and the government could have avoided hiring someone to do something \"illegal.\"</p><p>Most people would agree that public interest trumps commercial or privacy concerns, especially involving terrorism. I'm sure a poll would show that Apple's customers are more frightened of terrorist mayhem than of getting hacked by some identity thief or the NSA.</p><p>In essence, Apple has put itself - and its profits - above the law.</p><p>Such a position, by the way, is nothing new in Silicon Valley. Big Tech is as powerful and arrogant as Big Oil. This is because they are collectively more influential and richer than most nation-states. The big four - Apple, Alphabet/Google, Amazon and Facebook - have a combined market capitalization value of US$1.68 trillion.</p><p>And unlike Big Oil or Big Pharma or Big Banks, they are more self-righteous even though they have not exactly been exemplary corporate citizens.</p><p>Lest we forget, Google took the media's content without paying for it, then took all the advertisers without sharing the profits. This has created a gaping hole in the Fourth Estate that continues to widen, leaving democracies and the public shortchanged in terms of coverage, fact-checking and political accountability.</p><p>Only one media mogul, Rupert Murdoch, sued over this, but they all should have and now it's too late.</p><p>Big Tech has also been as aggressive and rapacious as other sectors. It has shopped the world for workers, suppliers and tax breaks. It gives enormous campaign contributions. It employs armies of lobbyists and lawyers to fight anti-competitive practices and taxation. Apple, and others, outsourced manufacturing to a Taiwanese company that exploited millions of Chinese workers. Sometimes, suicide nets were strung around worker dormitories after dozens threw themselves off rooftops because of working conditions and pay scales. Now the company is robotizing its factories to phase out human workers.</p><p>Others - like Silicon Valley darlings Uber and Airbnb - have flouted laws, regulations, licensing requirements, taxes, insurance requirements in order to provide services that pose a risk to public safety.</p><p>Both have become embroiled in battles around the world over injuries, damages and legalities. Uber should only deal with licensed and trained drivers and Airbnb should pay hotel taxes, accept liability for damages or violence and be responsible for screening both renters and rentees.</p><p>Instead, Big Tech remains steadfastly stubborn and self-righteous. Yes, they are smart; yes, they are successful; yes, they are improving the world. But they creating socio-economic problems for which they will be unwilling to compensate society.</p><p>The biggest issue will occur when automation, robots and Artificial Intelligence begin to destroy or degrade at least half of the jobs in the economy. Will Big Tech compensate and retrain workers? Will politicians on their payroll demand this?</p><p>The Apple controversy is a peek into this Brave New World. It's downright shocking that a company would refuse to co-operate with law-enforcement officials. But given Big Tech's attitude it shouldn't surprise.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dfrancis@nationalpost.com\">dfrancis@nationalpost.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

This trust factor showed up in a recent poll taken following the highly publicized legal battle between Apple and the U.S. Justice Department began.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Justice officials asked Apple to de-encrypt an iPhone used by a terrorist. Apple has refused to do so, becoming a Silicon Valley hero, billing itself as a defender of the private sector and privacy.</p><p>The tussle ended, perhaps temporarily, when Justice officials announced this week that a hacker has approached them who knows how to de-encrypt the phone.</p><p>I hope it works because it would serve Apple right. The company's stance was not heroic, it was commercial based on marketing promises that its phones were secure and no one could ever get into one.</p><p>Now Apple not only looks like a bad corporate citizen for balking at helping a terrorist investigation, but its brand will be harmed after the phone is hacked.</p><p>The best solution would have been a compromise: Apple should have made a deal with Justice in the face of evidence of wrongdoing and the government could have avoided hiring someone to do something \"illegal.\"</p><p>Most people would agree that public interest trumps commercial or privacy concerns, especially involving terrorism. I'm sure a poll would show that Apple's customers are more frightened of terrorist mayhem than of getting hacked by some identity thief or the NSA.</p><p>In essence, Apple has put itself - and its profits - above the law.</p><p>Such a position, by the way, is nothing new in Silicon Valley. Big Tech is as powerful and arrogant as Big Oil. This is because they are collectively more influential and richer than most nation-states. The big four - Apple, Alphabet/Google, Amazon and Facebook - have a combined market capitalization value of US$1.68 trillion.</p><p>And unlike Big Oil or Big Pharma or Big Banks, they are more self-righteous even though they have not exactly been exemplary corporate citizens.</p><p>Lest we forget, Google took the media's content without paying for it, then took all the advertisers without sharing the profits. This has created a gaping hole in the Fourth Estate that continues to widen, leaving democracies and the public shortchanged in terms of coverage, fact-checking and political accountability.</p><p>Only one media mogul, Rupert Murdoch, sued over this, but they all should have and now it's too late.</p><p>Big Tech has also been as aggressive and rapacious as other sectors. It has shopped the world for workers, suppliers and tax breaks. It gives enormous campaign contributions. It employs armies of lobbyists and lawyers to fight anti-competitive practices and taxation. Apple, and others, outsourced manufacturing to a Taiwanese company that exploited millions of Chinese workers. Sometimes, suicide nets were strung around worker dormitories after dozens threw themselves off rooftops because of working conditions and pay scales. Now the company is robotizing its factories to phase out human workers.</p><p>Others - like Silicon Valley darlings Uber and Airbnb - have flouted laws, regulations, licensing requirements, taxes, insurance requirements in order to provide services that pose a risk to public safety.</p><p>Both have become embroiled in battles around the world over injuries, damages and legalities. Uber should only deal with licensed and trained drivers and Airbnb should pay hotel taxes, accept liability for damages or violence and be responsible for screening both renters and rentees.</p><p>Instead, Big Tech remains steadfastly stubborn and self-righteous. Yes, they are smart; yes, they are successful; yes, they are improving the world. But they creating socio-economic problems for which they will be unwilling to compensate society.</p><p>The biggest issue will occur when automation, robots and Artificial Intelligence begin to destroy or degrade at least half of the jobs in the economy. Will Big Tech compensate and retrain workers? Will politicians on their payroll demand this?</p><p>The Apple controversy is a peek into this Brave New World. It's downright shocking that a company would refuse to co-operate with law-enforcement officials. But given Big Tech's attitude it shouldn't surprise.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dfrancis@nationalpost.com\">dfrancis@nationalpost.com</email> !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2016 Postmedia Network Inc.

Netflix faces imminent competition from Disney+ and Apple TV+, along with the existing Amazon Prime Video and several other looming rivals.</p><p>Netflix stock is at eight-month lows. Facebook\u00a0stock and Amazon stock are hitting resistance at their 50-day moving averages. Google stock is moving toward a new buy point. But the  for the FANG stocks ranges from lackluster to seriously lagging. Apple stock, by contrast, has been testing a  with its RS line at 2019 highs.</p><h>FANG Stocks Are MIA In 2019 Stock Market Rally</h><p>The stock market rally began 2019 with a powerful rally in software and other growth names. In recent weeks, growth stocks have tumbled while value plays move forward. But through it all, internet giants Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google are MIA. Google stock hit a record high in late April, then immediately crashed on earnings. Facebook stock and Amazon stock broke out in early July, but then sold off on earnings later this month.</p><p>After running up in early January, Netflix stock slightly lagged the S&amp;P 500 for several months. Shares plunged on July 18 after Netflix reported a rare decline in U.S. subscribers. Shares have continued to slide.</p><p>The relative strength line, which compares a stock's performance vs. the S&amp;P 500 index, is a great way to identify stock market winners and laggards. The RS line for Facebook stock is holding at a three-month low. It's at a six-month low for AMZN stock. The relative strength line for NFLX stock recently hit a 20-month low.</p><p>GOOGL stock is still working on a buy point from a  base. The RS line for Google stock is at the high of the handle, though it's well below the consolidation peak or the July 2018 all-time best.</p><h>FANG Stock Woes: Competition Probes Vs. Competition</h><p>The regulatory Big Tech probes of Facebook, Amazon, Google and, in some cases, Apple, generally focus on their dominance of online platforms. Those include probes or reviews by the Justice Department, various other federal agencies, at least two major multistate probes as well as various congressional hearings. Several lawmakers, including rising Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, have called for breaking up some or all of the internet giants.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met privately with several lawmakers and President Donald Trump last week.</p><p>Meanwhile, growth prospects for FANG stocks have cooled. Facebook earnings are expected to rebound in 2020, but much of that reflects big legal charges weighing on EPS this year. Amazon sales growth continues to slow, even with Amazon Web Services and fast-growing advertising revenue offsetting decelerating core e-commerce operations.</p><p>Netflix stock doesn't face antitrust concerns. Instead, it faces huge competition from Disney+ and other existing or future streaming networks, including a cheap $4.99 offering from Apple TV+. Keep in mind that while Netflix has reported adjusted earnings for several years, it's still burning huge amounts of cash. Deep-pocketed competitors like Walt Disney, Apple, Comcast and more can afford to run losses for years.</p><p>With U.S. growth prospects seeming capped, Netflix is counting on international expansion. But in much of the world Netflix charges far less for subscriptions. And it must spend on local content for local markets.</p><h>Apple Stock</h><p>Apple stock has been bouncing back and forth with a 221.41 buy point from a . Shares fell 1.5% to 217.73 on Friday, in part due to China trade war headlines. The RS line for AAPL stock recently hit 2019 highs. With many of the software and other high P-E leaders damaged, Apple stock's relative strength vs. the \"best stocks\" has improved significantly.</p><p>On a longer-term basis, Apple stock hasn't really outperformed the S&amp;P since 2012.</p><p>New  Friday. The new, cheaper base model handset may appeal to Chinese consumers. Next year's Apple iPhones should have 5G capability.</p><h>Why Apple Stock, FANG Stocks Matter</h><p>Apple and the FANG stocks may never again be the massive market leaders that they were for much of the past decade. But they could still go on decent runs. Even if CAN SLIM investors look for stronger performers, modest contributions from Apple stock, Amazon stock and the other internet giants could still fuel the broader market. Apple has a $1 trillion valuation. The FANG stocks have roughly a $2.4 trillion valuation. Netflix stock may be the weakest link, but it's also the smallest FANG at $118.5 billion, giving it room grow if it can sustain vs. rivals.</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4981596</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-0HP1-JCBB-K17P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

At time of writing, Apple accounts for 4.9% of the S&amp;P 500 index, while the FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) comprise about 18% of the index overall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'Significant tailwinds' can sustain FAANG outperformance despite growing regulation risk</emphasis></p><p>Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said Apple's push to a $2trn market cap will \"delight fans of round numbers\" and \"confirm the primacy of big tech in this market rally\", but will also provide confirmation to bearish investors that the rally has \"gone too far too fast\" and is \"in desperate need of a pullback\".</p><p>\"However, there is plenty of money around, as shown by the high demand for Germany's 30-year bond auction,\" he pointed out. \"Some of that will continue to find its way into such high momentum plays as Apple and other tech stocks.\"</p><p>Randeep Somel, associate fund manager (equities) at M&amp;G Investments, said Apple's new milestone reflects consumers' increased focus and reliance on technology since the outbreak of the pandemic, but warned the future for mega-cap tech stocks is \"less clear\".</p><p>\"Most notably, the increasing size and influence of these companies has brought with it greater scrutiny from regulators.

A deep recession could spoil Apple's bull run by knocking demand for its premium products like iPhones, iPads and MacBooks,\" he pointed out. \"However, Apple has a few strings to its bow and its services arm, which includes Apple Music and Apple TV, is likely to continue to be a revenue driver for the business regardless of whether the overall economy is growing or not.</p><p>\"In addition, the US-China trade conflict remains a threat. Further escalation in the conflict could leave Apple, who are heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing for products such as smartphones, exposed.\"</p><p>Mike Kerley, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Global Investors, agreed US-China trade tensions are also a significant factor to consider when looking at Apple, given some 17% of its revenue comes from China.</p><p>\"There has been no suggestion so far that the demand for US goods is being impacted by the rising tension between the two countries, and there has been no indication in the state sponsored media so far that this might impact demand for US brands,\" he reasoned.</p><p>\"There is precedent, however, in 2012 with Japan and 2017 with South Korea, where China took economic revenge, significantly impacting the demand for Japanese and Korean brands.\"</p><p>Kerley pointed out that Chinese Premier Xi Jinping would \"not stand idly by indefinitely\" while his \"key projects and objectives are dismantled by US politicians\".</p><p>\"China has accounted for an ever increasing percentage of world GDP growth in the last ten years and will continue to do this in the next ten,\" he explained.</p><p>\"As a result, higher disposable incomes will mean higher consumption of goods with the Chinese consumer accounting for a large proportion of consumption growth globally.</p><p>\"American companies want and need exposure to this growth as their share prices and valuations depend on it. It is not a card Xi wants to play but it is a significant one and certainly not accounted for in stock prices at record highs.\"</p><p>That said, Somel pointed out that other consumer-facing FAANG stocks - notably Amazon - will benefit from the secular trend of cloud and public computing business regardless of tensions.</p><p>\"The longer office workers continue to work remotely from home, the increased likelihood we have that this becomes a more permanent fixture,\" he said. </p><p>\"This benefits cloud operators as companies scale down on-site presence (including own servers), and continue moving them to the cloud. </p><p>\"That said, the upcoming rollout of 5G will be a good opportunity for handset makers to refresh their products with new technology and provide a strong update cycle. This should benefit Apple.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVWK-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVWK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MX-K9H1-F0PT-C1WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355741</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investment Week</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63986\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00021UQ</classCode><className>LEGG MASON INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

But as the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reopens about 100 of its retail stores globally, the customer experience is bound to feel different. Apple will be enforcing strict social distancing guidelines in its stores, Apple retail and HR chief Deirdre O'Brien wrote in a public letter this weekend. The company will cap the number of people allowed in to keep at least 6 feet between everyone, will require masks and will check customers' temperatures before they enter. </p><p>Some stores will only do curbside pickup. Apple said it would also be doing \"enhanced deep cleanings\" on all display products, as well as tables and other parts of the store.\u00c2\u00a0 \"While we know many customers are eager for their local store to reopen, our commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,\" Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy said in an email. Apple has been one of the tech giants most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Apple hard when it began spreading across China early this year. Apple will open at least 25 stores in seven states across the U.S. this week, adding to five it unshuttered last week. Apple stores reopening represent a slow, but accelerating, recovery for the iPhone maker. Apple was among the first of major American companies to feel the business pain of the coronavirus pandemic as many of its manufacturing plants closed across Asia early this year. Shortly after, Apple shut nearly all of its 510 retail stores across the world. The company's iPhone sales fell slightly during the first quarter of the year, an indication of how much coronavirus had shaken the company's roots. CEO Tim Cook said production levels had returned to normal, but it is unclear whether Apple is on track to launch a new version of the phone this fall, as it usually does. Big tech companies are expected to pull through the pandemic in decent economic shape overall, but Apple and Amazon have been dealing with physical effects more than others. Both companies have thousands of workers in warehouses and, in Apple's case, in retail stores. Getting those people back to work in person has meant an exercise in implementing safety measures and navigating government regulations. Apple's reopenings are a boost for the company symbolically, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, and also will help financially. \"The stores opening back up is a much needed shot in the arm for Cook and Cupertino,\" he said. It's unclear exactly how the Apple shopping experience will change with the new measures in place, which eliminate some of the custom experience of shopping at the retailer. But Apple did say people might have to wait in line if the store reaches a limited capacity, and said it will limit the number of staff each customer deals with. In Berlin, tech worker Rouzbeh Abadi said he waited in line for about 20 minutes to get into an Apple store and check out the new iPad keyboard. Apple staff members asked him why he was there, then made sure he had a mask and used hand sanitizer before he started shopping, he said. An Apple staffer stayed with him the whole time he shopped to help out, and perhaps make sure he stayed at least six feet from others, Abadi said. The experience had a different feel from what he was used to. \"Before, I always went to Apple store to [browse], just because I enjoy it,\" he said in a message. \"But now, I think I won't go there if I have no particular reason.\" Apple began reopening stores with similar social distancing measures in China and surrounding areas in mid-March, but waited nearly two months to start swinging open the doors of U.S. stores, as most of country remains under stay-at-home orders. By the end of the week, Apple plans to have about 30 stores open in the country, making up about 9% of its 271 U.S. locations. Stores will reopen at 25 locations in California, Washington, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii and Oklahoma this week. The company said it is following local regulations in each city and state. In California and Washington state, where the company is reopening a total of 13 stores, only curbside pickup will be allowed. \"These are not decisions we rush into - and a store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventive step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,\" O'Brien wrote. Apple's precautions and limits on its retail stores echo what many other physical locations have already put in place - something anyone who has waited an hour to get into a grocery store this year will recognize.

But as the Cupertino, California-based tech giant reopens about 100 of its retail stores globally, the customer experience is bound to feel different. Apple will be enforcing strict social distancing guidelines in its stores, Apple retail and HR chief Deirdre O'Brien wrote in a public letter this weekend. The company will cap the number of people allowed in to keep at least 6 feet between everyone, will require masks and will check customers' temperatures before they enter. </p><p>Some stores will only do curbside pickup. Apple said it would also be doing \"enhanced deep cleanings\" on all display products, as well as tables and other parts of the store.\u00c2\u00a0 \"While we know many customers are eager for their local store to reopen, our commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,\" Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy said in an email. Apple has been one of the tech giants most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which hit Apple hard when it began spreading across China early this year. Apple will open at least 25 stores in seven states across the U.S. this week, adding to five it unshuttered last week. Apple stores reopening represent a slow, but accelerating, recovery for the iPhone maker. Apple was among the first of major American companies to feel the business pain of the coronavirus pandemic as many of its manufacturing plants closed across Asia early this year. Shortly after, Apple shut nearly all of its 510 retail stores across the world. The company's iPhone sales fell slightly during the first quarter of the year, an indication of how much coronavirus had shaken the company's roots. CEO Tim Cook said production levels had returned to normal, but it is unclear whether Apple is on track to launch a new version of the phone this fall, as it usually does. Big tech companies are expected to pull through the pandemic in decent economic shape overall, but Apple and Amazon have been dealing with physical effects more than others. Both companies have thousands of workers in warehouses and, in Apple's case, in retail stores. Getting those people back to work in person has meant an exercise in implementing safety measures and navigating government regulations. Apple's reopenings are a boost for the company symbolically, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, and also will help financially. \"The stores opening back up is a much needed shot in the arm for Cook and Cupertino,\" he said. It's unclear exactly how the Apple shopping experience will change with the new measures in place, which eliminate some of the custom experience of shopping at the retailer. But Apple did say people might have to wait in line if the store reaches a limited capacity, and said it will limit the number of staff each customer deals with. In Berlin, tech worker Rouzbeh Abadi said he waited in line for about 20 minutes to get into an Apple store and check out the new iPad keyboard. Apple staff members asked him why he was there, then made sure he had a mask and used hand sanitizer before he started shopping, he said. An Apple staffer stayed with him the whole time he shopped to help out, and perhaps make sure he stayed at least six feet from others, Abadi said. The experience had a different feel from what he was used to. \"Before, I always went to Apple store to [browse], just because I enjoy it,\" he said in a message. \"But now, I think I won't go there if I have no particular reason.\" Apple began reopening stores with similar social distancing measures in China and surrounding areas in mid-March, but waited nearly two months to start swinging open the doors of U.S. stores, as most of country remains under stay-at-home orders. By the end of the week, Apple plans to have about 30 stores open in the country, making up about 9% of its 271 U.S. locations. Stores will reopen at 25 locations in California, Washington, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii and Oklahoma this week. The company said it is following local regulations in each city and state. In California and Washington state, where the company is reopening a total of 13 stores, only curbside pickup will be allowed. \"These are not decisions we rush into - and a store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventive step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,\" O'Brien wrote. Apple's precautions and limits on its retail stores echo what many other physical locations have already put in place - something anyone who has waited an hour to get into a grocery store this year will recognize. The future of retail for the foreseeable future will almost certainly involve masks for all, long lines and wide berths between customers. \u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CG-XRM1-DYTP-P3GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"809\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

Apple will be enforcing strict social distancing guidelines in its stores, Apple retail and human resources chief Deirdre O'Brien wrote in a public letter this weekend. The company will cap the number of people allowed in to keep at least six feet between everyone, will require masks and will check customers' temperatures before they enter. Some stores will only do curbside pickup.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple said it would also be doing \"enhanced deep cleanings\" on all display products, as well as tables and other parts of the store.</p><p>\"While we know many customers are eager for their local store to reopen, our commitment is to reopen our stores when we are confident the environment is safe,\" Apple spokesperson Nick Leahy said in an email.</p><p>Apple has been one of the tech giants most affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which hit the company hard when it began spreading across China early this year. Apple will open at least 25 stores in seven states across the United States this week, adding to five it unshuttered last week.</p><p>Apple stores reopening represent a slow but accelerating recovery for the iPhone maker.</p><p>Apple was among the first of major American companies to feel the business pain of the coronavirus pandemic, as many of its manufacturing plants closed across Asia early this year. Shortly after, Apple shut nearly all of its 510 retail stores across the world.</p><p>The company's iPhone sales fell slightly during the first quarter of the year, an indication of how much coronavirus had shaken the company's roots. Chief executive Tim Cook said production levels had returned to normal, but it is unclear whether Apple is on track to launch a new version of the phone this fall, as it usually does.</p><p>Big tech companies are expected to pull through the pandemic in decent economic shape overall, but Apple and Amazon have been dealing with physical effects more than others. Both companies have thousands of workers in warehouses and, in Apple's case, in retail stores. Getting those people back to work in person has meant an exercise in implementing safety measures and navigating government regulations.</p><p>Apple's reopenings are a boost for the company symbolically, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, and also will help financially.</p><p>\"The stores opening back up is a much needed shot in the arm for Cook and Cupertino,\" he said.</p><p>It's unclear exactly how the Apple shopping experience will change with the new measures in place, which eliminate some of the custom experience of shopping at the retailer. But Apple did say people might have to wait in line if the store reaches a limited capacity, and said it will limit the number of staff each customer deals with.</p><p>In Berlin, tech worker Rouzbeh Abadi said he waited in line for about 20 minutes to get into an Apple store and check out the new iPad magic keyboard. Apple staff asked him why he was there, then made sure he had a mask and used hand sanitizer before he started shopping, he said.</p><p>An Apple staff member stayed with him the whole time he shopped to help out - and perhaps make sure he stayed at least six feet from others, Abadi said. The experience had a different feel from what he was used to.</p><p>\"Before, I always went to Apple store to [browse], just because I enjoy it,\" he said in a message. \"But now, I think I won't go there if I have no particular reason.\"</p><p>Apple began reopening stores with similar social distancing measures in China and surrounding areas in mid-March, but waited nearly two months to start swinging open the doors of U.S. stores, as most of country remains under stay-at-home orders.</p><p>By the end of the week, Apple plans to have about 30 stores open in the country, making up only about 9 percent of its 271 U.S. locations. Stores will reopen at 25 locations in California, Washington, Florida, Colorado, Hawaii, Arkansas and Oklahoma this week.</p><p>The company said it is following local regulations in each city and state. In California and Washington state, where the company is reopening a total of 13 stores, only curbside pickup will be allowed.</p><p>\"These are not decisions we rush into - and a store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventive step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,\" O'Brien wrote.</p><p>Apple's precautions and limits on its retail stores echo what many other physical locations have already put in place - something anyone who has waited an hour to get into a grocery store this year will recognize. The future of retail for the foreseeable future will almost certainly involve masks for all, long lines and wide berths between customers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-217367d3189e42249d22cac3b3554d73</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXS-9PM1-JB4M-V00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><timeReceived>7:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 18, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The add-on allows broadcast content to be viewed on a mobile or tablet. 'While this attachment is great, what we would really love to see is a chip built into mobile devices to give consumers this technology,' Smith said. 'But to date, manufacturers, Apple being one, refuse to enable broadcast chips in their devices.' Quoting recent remarks by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, Smith said the big tech companies had bulldozed competition and stifled innovation. 'I wonder if this growing tech power is one of the reasons why this consumer benefit is being held back by the manufacturers,' he continued. Smith called for the modernisation of 'outdated' broadcast regulations that would allow local broadcasters to compete on a level playing field with the larger tech and pay-TV companies to 'better ensure that broadcast journalism can flourish'. Regulation, he said, should be increased to ensure the companies could use their market power to stifle competition and the financial viability of local news.

As Apple prepares to gather the ashes of Beats Music and relaunch its own streaming music service \u2014 which sources say will likely to be paid-only \u2014 this\u00a0gambit\u00a0would decimate Spotify's user base from 60 million total users to only 15 million paid users. </p><p>Moreover, sources told the outlet that if Universal Music Group removed its catalog from YouTube, Apple would pay the licensing fee the label conglomerate receives from that platform. (YouTube also has a streaming service in the offing). Considering Apple's ability to preload apps onto new versions of iOS \u2014 not to the mention the fact that it already has 800 million credit cards on file and so only needs to convince a tiny portion of them to sign up\u00a0in order to beat Spotify \u2014 the move would be an effective knockout punch for Apple in America's streaming music fight. These tricks are dirty, unfair, and possibly illegal \u2014 especially in Europe where regulators are far tougher on big tech firms accused of antitrust violations. But you know what? Part of me sincerely hopes Apple gets away with it. Here's why. First off, as countless anti-Spotify artists have pointed out, there's nothing remotely 'fair' about labels' current arrangement with Spotify. When a listener who pays $9.99 a month for the service listens to a song, rightsholders receive ten times the royalty payment that is paid out when a listener on the free tier hears a song. The amount of revenue generated by these paid listeners is staggeringly higher[2] \u2014 both per-user and in aggregate \u2014 than the amount generated by freeloaders. In 2013, fee subscriptions like Spotify's paid tier generated $628 million for the record industry while free ad-supported listening tiers generated only $220 million (the remaining $590 million is made up of\u00a0online radio royalties, primarily from Pandora). That disparity is even greater when taking into account the fact that based on generous estimates there are fewer than 30 million people worldwide who pay for Spotify, Rdio, and other streaming platforms, while there are up to 400 million monthly active users listening for free, if you include people who use YouTube to listen to music. In other words, less than ten percent of the listening public creates almost half the total revenue generated by streaming music across the board. And while Spotify's ad units have become more inventive and may become more lucrative as the company scales, it's clear that the only business model that makes sense both for artists and for the streaming services themselves \u2014 none of which have achieved longterm profitability \u2014 is one supported by paid listeners, not advertisements. There's an argument to be made, however, that most users simply won't pay for music anymore, and that if options like Spotify's free tier are taken away consumers\u00a0will merely return to piracy. That may be true. Indeed, as Spotify's user base has grown the percentage of users willing to pay $9.99 a month for full mobile access and to avoid ads has held steady at only 25 percent. But that doesn't necessarily mean most users won't pay for music \u2014 it simply means most users are unwilling to pay $120 a year for music \u2014 which was true even in the cash-soaked days of CDs, when consumers paid an average of $28 a year. Meanwhile, Apple found that the average iTunes user was willing to spend $48 a year on music, or $4 a month. And so\u00a0with Apple's entry into the streaming music game, we could see a repeat of the early 2000s when iTunes came in\u00a0to help stop the bleeding caused by piracy \u2014 or in this case, free streaming which\u00a0while somewhat more lucrative than piracy is perhaps almost as unfair\u00a0\u2014 while undercutting the competition and effectively taking over as the dominant music distributor. And while labels were initially reluctant to accept Steve Jobs' terms when he proposed iTunes, the reason for these industry incumbents' misgivings was that iTunes would forever sever songs from albums \u2014 just as the Internet unbundled newspapers \u2014 thus\u00a0ensuring a consumer would never again pay ten dollars or more to access just one song. Today, however, that unbundling is already the new normal in the music industry so labels have much less to lose. Of course this could be a PR nightmare for Apple \u2014 'Tim Cook took away free music!' And there's always the possibility for unforeseen consequences when one large company controls the distribution channels within an entire industry, hence the reason for antitrust legislation. But the current system is broken. Spotify has built a huge user base by providing a complimentary service that it cannot afford to offer for free. Despite striking proprietary deals in secret with labels \u2014 deals that many artists say gives them little shot at making a fair wage \u2014 the company still isn't profitable. It doesn't work for Spotify or artists. The only constituent it does work for \u2014 other than perhaps labels who take huge percentages of the streaming revenue\u00a0\u2014 is fans. But for how long? Unless users start paying \u2014 which is precisely what Apple's gambit forces \u2014 there is no foreseeable 'sustainability' in the streaming industry. And\u00a0while the EU and DOJ should scrutinize Apple over these moves, the fact that by making a number of potential antitrust violations Apple would be making streaming music\u00a0more\u00a0fair, simply speaks to how completely unjust the status quo is.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three,  reporting earnings today.  And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are  out after the closing bell.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the  tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory.  That's down 10  percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves.  The Dow  Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving  higher.  This after declines across the board yesterday with the NASDAQ,  the hardest hit down more than one and one-third percent.</p><p> And despite recent weakness however, all of your market gauges, Dow, S&amp;P,  NASDAQ, even the Dow Transports, and the Russell2000 are on track for  monthly gains as we wrap up the month of July.  </p><p> In Europe, mixed move to report, we have a slight gain on the FT-100 in  England but the French and German markets are heading lower.  A reading on  the euro zone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets a little changed, although we have green to  report except the Hang Seng slipping half of one percent.  The Bank of  Japan surprising investors by keeping policy, monetary policy unchanged.</p><p> Protecting our border, President Trump doubling down on his calls for a  government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But one new development, a change in that timeline, the  president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm  elections.  That's from a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p> We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus  cyber security later this morning.</p><p> King James takes on the commander-in-chief, LeBron James getting political  slamming the president by saying he's using sports to divide this country.</p><p> Plus, a homeless web developer and his plea for a job goes viral.  Instead  for asking for money, he asked people to take his resume and it resulted in  hundreds of responses.</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Contributor Kat  Timpf is here.  Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.   And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Much to talk about with these  technology stocks, the economy.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  We have Apple earnings  -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech  wreck, the correction continues.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  We'll see if Apple can  save the day here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear  from you as well.  I know you love talking stocks.</p><p> KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I love talking stocks.  I'm  like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're an expert on a lot.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That too.  We'll get to that.  And to our top story this hour,  the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp;  Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p> But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple  reports its quarterly results.  Estimates are calling for earnings per  share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.  </p><p> This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and  Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following  Facebook's massive miss last week.  </p><p> Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax.   Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a  Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a  consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite  the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and  Twitter do.</p><p> DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  I think that's  right Dagen.  I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the  performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak  quarter.</p><p> But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services  is performing.  And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products  likely in September.  And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a  differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like  augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy  and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p> BELL:  Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors  what they want to hear about the new iPhones?  Are they all going to be  released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year  where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p> FLAX:  I think it's possible that they all get announced in September.   We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the  devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little  bit later.</p><p> But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs  to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market.   Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if  necessary to get the product right.</p><p> And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this  single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do  over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users  trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p> TIMPF:  How about --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all  these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.  </p><p> Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether  saying, \"All right.  You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you  know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the  social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to  expectations.\"</p><p> Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you  know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p> FLAX:  I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the  growth.  And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're  growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p>Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud  business and advertising is a newer business for them too.  </p><p> In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has  telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's  really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to  navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all  appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming  to the four.</p><p> And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be --  allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their  data.  And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate  a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street  Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC  FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies,  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla,  (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p> But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the  recent high, the recent record on June 20th.  Not the first time it  happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is  the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this  year.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of  think that this move has been overdone.  This is in a sector that's  entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems  within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p> But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet,  these are all really good reports.  Even Netflix, I know it was a miss.   That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its  most recent high this year.</p><p> The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected,  do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as  the overall FANG group?</p><p> FLAX:  Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going  to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and  ultimately grow.  I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has  certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in  content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p> But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the  space as well.  When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point  on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them  and analyze them one-by-one.  I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a  brush across them.</p><p> So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to  like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends  around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth  runway.</p><p> And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's  bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're  trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term  horizon.  And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to  two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market  selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying  opportunity.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the --  again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is  extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've  entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are  made in China by Foxconn.</p><p> They can't readily shift production to another country for that.  And we  will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to  this trade fight?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could  punch back at the United States --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- if we increased tariffs.  We -- they sell a lot more to us  than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.  </p><p> So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life  more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China.   Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese  economy receptive to foreign investment.  But the -- one of the ways that  they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Exactly.  How --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- they could increase the spying that they do on their  corporate executives here and really around the world.  They could hold up  goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation.   There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all?  I  mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk  start up again between the U.S. and China.  You know, the U.S. and the  Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the  works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again?  So that's on  hold right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk  about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know,  months today all the market gauges are up.  The Dow Transports are up the  most of any other major market gauges.</p><p> But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the  overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your  age group?</p><p> TIMPF:  I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people  look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this.  I think that people are  concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.  </p><p> I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people  are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters  specifically are.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say,  put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p> FLAX:  So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their  way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next  few years.</p><p> What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing,  building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to  grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.  </p><p> And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out  of digital economies.  So you take a company like Apple there are a far  reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that  is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dan, good to see you.  Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this  morning.  </p><p> FLAX:  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we wait for the Apple results.  Coming up, California  scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating  its own weather system.  Plus, how the military is waging the war on that  blaze.</p><p>CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual  harassment allegations.  The board of directors taking a major action to  get some answers.  More on that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we  still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain  on the Futures.</p><p> But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month  of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green  for the month.  The biggest winner are the Dow Transports.  Dow Transports  are up nearly six percent so far in July.  And if you're a big believer in  old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the  economy.</p><p> Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr  Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has  now burned over 100,000 acres.  Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this  fire right now.  This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's  history.</p><p> Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds  making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to  spread next.  Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p> At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the  wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk  helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating  tragedy out in California.  </p><p> Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to  conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of  sexual misconduct.  The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which  six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.  </p><p>CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday.  Shares of CBS are  down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking  yesterday.</p><p> Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets.  They are  shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt.  G.E. Digital has  continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment.  Company  has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation.   Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p> And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance.  A  homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes  while he was standing next to a highway.  This happened in Silicon Valley  of all places.  </p><p> Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that  read, \"Homeless, hungry for success.  Take a resume.\"  His luck changed  after his job pitch went viral on the internet.  Casares who by the way has  a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of  money.</p><p> Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even  Pandora, Dagen.  So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a  heart.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p> TIMPF:  Oh, I love it.  It's my absolute favorite, yes.  This is so, so, so  nice.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and,  again, it's --</p><p> TIMPF:  And anyone --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really  sad to see something like that.  But this guy, someone who believes in  himself.  He says, \"I have something to offer.  I can take a job, I can do  this for you.\"  And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Can I give you the geek response to this?  I --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  See this has read another example of how tight our labor  market is.  We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies  everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people,  for labor.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill  them.  So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  And so a man on a street can get a job.  But, you know, we see  this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting  jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before.   This is a great example of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It really is an incredible economy.  That it is opening  itself to one and all.</p><p> BELL:  Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you  know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted  that were reaching out to him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But some of the people at those companies when it comes to  hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to  college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible  people who didn't go to Ivy League schools.  And that --</p><p> BELL:  I agree.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that  snootiness at some of these tech companies.  </p><p> BELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know that for a fact.  Coming up, President Trump doubling  down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not  approved.  But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p> And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again.  The details on  Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We are working closely with our European partners including Italy  to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.  Now is also the perfect time to  expand commerce between the United States and Italy. </p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates  enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida  later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event  and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p> Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight?  Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they  tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying  what his supporters want to hear?</p><p> TIMPF:  I think that they're definitely a little bit separate.  The economy  is doing very well right now.  But when you talk about trade and tariffs  particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the  economy.</p><p> And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican  president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the  conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of  view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's  really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this  is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and  republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p> But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been  cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property  from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology.  When he's able to  talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together.  And  certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election  was take over blue collar America basically.  You know, he taps in to  people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p> And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally  support for him.  The question is, what does it do for the rest of the  country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through  on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000  instead of $20,000.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting  with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission.  That seems to at  least be on hold.  That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock  market.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he  needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p> And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we  might have seen is that pivot taking place next week.  And so what I'm  waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese.  There  hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to  talking or is he going to ratchet things up?  And we just don't know where  he stands there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about China.  China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot  more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion  worth of goods from China every year.  They buy about $130 billion from the  United States.</p><p> China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is  beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods.  Here is  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position  overseas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Trump Administration is  committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.   We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles  of freedom and openness.</p><p> Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will  continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and  open Indo-Pacific.  President Trump will strike when the iron is hot  because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p> We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long  as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens  demand.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p> BELL:  You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing  that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and  especially within the Asian market.  And with China in particular, these  tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to  maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual  property and technology.</p><p> The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to  the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first  thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out  of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  </p><p> So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you  know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of  the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing  what he said on the campaign trail.  He's been focused on if I said it, I'm  going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said.  You know,  he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign  trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong  direction.</p><p> TIMPF:  He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies,  things like that.  But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been  very consistent the entire time.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has.  And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about  it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to  prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that.   You're going to have to wait.  I don't know when I'll get to ask them about  it but I will be asking you about that very thing.  </p><p> Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who  have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong  borders and powerful trade.  I never sought their support because I don't  need their money or bad ideas.  They love my tax and regulation cuts,  judicial picks and more.\"</p><p> \"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated.  I have beaten them  at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from  being taxed.  I'm for America First and the American worker.  A puppet for  no one.  Two nice guys with bad ideas.  Make America great again.\"</p><p> TIMPF:  Typical Trump tweet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  And he basically covered everything we were just  talking about.</p><p> Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his  back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the  agency.</p><p> And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump.  The NBA star says  the President of the United States is a divider when it comes to the NFL  protests.  The new comments, ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p> Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both  reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after  the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the  likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those  companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p> Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point  gain on the Dow Futures.  We have green across the board.  And as we move  into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday.  The NASDAQ lost more  than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.  </p><p> And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and  the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p> European markets are mixed this morning.  Right now, it's green across the  board.  We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany.  And in  Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan,  Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser,  the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p> Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again  on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all  sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful.  We are doing a  phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work.   So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President threatening government shutdown over border  security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will  happen after the midterm elections now.  We'll hear from Homeland Security  Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this  morning.</p><p> LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star  saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his  inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p> Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service  says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases  and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p> Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his  threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for  border security.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.  As  you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're  going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law  enforcement very high.  But I would be certainly willing to consider a  shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  However, one administration official says that the President has  agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm  elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the  Wall Street Journal today.  Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the  Federalist.  Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for  Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p> BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes, I think that this speaks to  a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is.  I mean,  this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20  years.  </p><p> And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing  resolution is when there is a shutdown looming.  So, I think, rhetorically,  it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only  time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually  doing things.</p><p> I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official  out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind  of, soften this eventually.  This is what we have seen, kind of, time and  time again.  I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall  that Mexico was going to pay for.  And it was going to be just this entire  wall of concrete.  </p><p> And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain  sections along the border and, right.  So I think that there is the tough  line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization  and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or  just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's  already said he's going to do it.  What do you think is the point of  waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p> PAYTON:  Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want  to delay that.  I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out  and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to  make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout  this whole time.  </p><p> And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not  -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that  this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go  through.</p><p> So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue,  and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered  on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for  the wall funding.  There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus  spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for,  essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall.  And there were  no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there  to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that  omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the  Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid  that until after November?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think what's going on here is the President has lost his  patience.  And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade  fight, you know.  In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers,  including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.  </p><p> And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to --  we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did.   And that's been the story of 2018.  I think he lost his patience on this  question of border security and the border wall.  </p><p> But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan  and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election  because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are  trying to hold to the House.</p><p> So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're  just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in  the process.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as  the Democrats.  Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell  in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative  win, and that's those tax cuts.  </p><p> And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four  percent right now.  That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so  incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are  unemployed at this point.  So, again, if you want to side -- you want to  run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p> PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  And I think the economy, even though it was  politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a  bigger priority and a bigger win.  I'm putting that in quotes than the  border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p> So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get  done before this border wall funding was able to get done.  And I think  this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party,  which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are  going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p> They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's  going to vote as a block.  And they don't use carrots and sticks.  They  don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they  want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within  leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in  order to get things done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of  Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters,  ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees.  Do  cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in  terms of messaging?</p><p> PAYTON:  Oh, I think, absolutely.  I mean, listen, if you're upset about  the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies,  there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it  and raise media attention.  </p><p> I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming  over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating  individuals coming over together.  And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p> So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled  veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer  camp.  That's not the way to do that.  And, I think, Portland mayor  reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these  protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p> I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the  Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a  border.  They don't like the fact that there are laws.  I think it's  demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I  should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I would just encourage all of these elected officials  to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and  breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking.  As if that that's not  a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many  women putting their lives at risk for that.  </p><p> Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p> PAYTON:  Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bre Payton.  Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron  DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is  heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and  also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in  the show.</p><p> But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star  is saying the President is using sports to divide this country.  Plus --  and movie pass, not getting a pass from fans after the company pulls major  movies like Mission Impossible Fallout, from its program, the internet  backlash, instant and brutal.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good news for Credit Suisse and its shareholders.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Dagen, that is right.  Credit Suisse now on track to report its  first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than  doubled from last year.  This, of course, is beating the street's forecast.   The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions  along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest  of the year.  Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the  premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.  </p><p> Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its  vehicles.  The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door  cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year.  The system lets drivers  know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even  kids.  Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.  </p><p> Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto.  Remember,  when they debuted this?  Made such a big deal about it.  Well, they now  want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead.  Uber acquired Anthony  Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they  later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's  Waymo, that he stole trade secrets.  That resulted in a lawsuit against  Uber that was settled back in February.  The move does not affect Uber  freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.  </p><p> And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated.  The  CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including  \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app.  The all  you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its  parent company ran out of cash, literally.  Take a look at some of the  tweets.  A lot of good reaction.  This one says, a live look at the  MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office.  Here's a tweet with  the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes.  Shares  of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year.  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Lebron James accuses the  president of the United States of dividing the nation.  The NBA star's  blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in  less than two years.  Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Dagen, good morning.  Some good  news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential  benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players.  News  broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry,  announces retirement having suffered six concussions.  Report release that  shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts.   While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments,  now the NFL has distributed over $502 million.  It had been projected the  league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went  into effect January 2017.  521 players have been paid.  Now, projected the  league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.  </p><p> Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all  eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment.   They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available  for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition.  The  settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their  families.  </p><p> While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between  sports and politics.  While President Trump has been outspoken about his  strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his  involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry  Jones, called his involvement problematic.  And last night, Lebron James  said this:</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS:  He's kind of using sport to,  kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know  that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white.  Sports has  never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings  someone together.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider  that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew  they go to championship.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers,  John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said:  \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\"   President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for  divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people  in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.  </p><p> MAX:  This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you  think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he  handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in  this conversation?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that this issue is just so  polarizing.  There's two sides.  Each of them feels very strong emotions  about their particular side.  There's really no solution to this that's  going to make everybody happy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me  that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this  country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to  Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down  and never gets anywhere.  So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on  this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being  kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally  dug in.  </p><p> HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had  acted strongly and it never would've come to this?  </p><p> MAX:  Well, I think he was scared.  Everyone going through this for the  first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this.  What I think -- he  became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable  to do this.  What could he have done?  I've said this on the air, I think,  for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would  certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is  terrible.  It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and  the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car  knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble.  And that's where I  think Roger Goodell is.  Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt  with this.  He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you  stand for the anthem.  Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done  that properly. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and  the like, some of them keep talking about it.  </p><p> MAX:  Not easy situation to deal with.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Jared Max.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Tuesday, July 31.  </p><p> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Earnings driving the action on Wall Street.  Three Dow components reporting  today -- Pfizer up first, the pharmaceutical giant posting better than  expected results.  It raised its full year profit guidance but it did slash  its revenue outlook.  You can take a look.  That stock treading some water  right here, right now.</p><p> The big one to watch -- Apple.  It reports after the close.  We have a  preview.</p><p> Plus a closer look at the tech wreck.  Key stocks entering correction  territory.  That's a loss of 10 percent or more from those June record  highs.</p><p> Checking the market action across the board the Dow futures are improving - - 44-point gain on the Dow futures to wrap up the month of July.  This,  after declines across the board yesterday.  The Nasdaq hardest hit  yesterday, down more than one and a one-third percent.  We have gains right  now.</p><p> And despite the recent weakness, we do have a tendency to focus on the  short-term.  And it has been rough in some of these big name technology  stocks like Facebook and Twitter.  But all of your major market gauges from  the Dow down to the Dow transports and the Russell 2000 small cap index --  they are all on track for monthly gains.  The Dow transports are up almost  6 percent in July.</p><p> In Europe let's take a look at England, France and Germany.  A reading on  the Eurozone economy showed slowing growth in the second quarter but all of  those markets there managing to eke out a gain.</p><p> Before we move on, we've got Proctor &amp; Gamble reporting earnings right  here, right now.  If you're watching on the television, you can look at the  bottom of your screen.  But we've got 94 cents a share -- that's 4 cents  above the estimate, up 90 cents a share.  That's for people listening on  the radio.  $16.5 billion in revenue, it's a slight miss on the revenue  side on the revenue side, on the top line.</p><p> In Asia overnight, the markets there already closed.  But it was gains  across the board except for half of 1 percent loss on the Hang Seng.  The  Bank of Japan surprising investors by keeping its monetary policy  unchanged.</p><p> And then moving out west, devastation in northern California -- wildfires  raging, burning more than 100,000 acres and the fire's so hot it's creating  its own weather system.  How the U.S. military is now joining the fight.   That's ahead.</p><p> Plus another health scare for Chipotle.  One restaurant closing after  several diners reportedly got sick.  That stock under pressure this  morning.</p><p> And millennial money -- a new survey shows where the generation is  investing.  The results might surprise you.</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning.  Fox News contributor Kat  Timpf is here.  She's going to weigh in on that.  \"Wall Street Journal\"  global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist  Lindsey Bell.</p><p> Real quick -- how do you invest your money -- Kat Timpf?  </p><p> KAT TIMPF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  You pay somebody who knows  what they're talking about to invest it for you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok, thank you very much.</p><p> TIMPF:  That's what I do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have another alternative.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  That's  mighty trusting of you putting it in somebody else's hands.  I don't know.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know, index funds -- Kat.  Index funds.  We'll talk in the  break.</p><p> Thank you -- guys.</p><p> We've got so much to talk about.  </p><p> To our top story this hour -- President Trump traveling to Tampa today to  host a rally to talk jobs, economy, and a show of force for Congressman Ron  DeSantis.</p><p> President Trump's visit comes ahead of a competitive primary race DeSantis  faces against Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam for Florida governor,  for the Republican nomination for governor.</p><p> Trump's support has had a major impact on the polls.  The latest numbers  show DeSantis making on major comeback, now up 11 percentage points ahead  of the primary election next month amid President Trump's endorsement.  The  congressman releasing a campaign ad in his race for governor that is going  viral and it's full of a lot of love for the President.</p><p> Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASEY DESANTIS, WIFE OF RON DESANTIS:  Everyone knows my husband Ron  DeSantis is endorsed by President Trump.  But he's also an amazing dad.   Ron loves playing with the kids.  </p><p> REP. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  Build the wall.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  He reads stories.  </p><p> R. DESANTIS:  Then Mr. Trump said, \"you're fired\".  I love that part.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  He's teaching Madison to talk.  </p><p> R. DESANTIS:  Make America great again.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  People say Ron's all Trump, but he is so much more.  </p><p> R. DESANTIS:  Big league -- so good.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  I just thought you should know.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ron DeSantis for governor.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, the Florida congressman himself -- Ron DeSantis,  a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.   Congressman -- that has sent people who dislike President Trump, I don't  care what party affiliation they have, into a frenzy.  They are losing  their minds about that.</p><p> But do you risk anything really going full-in on President Trump, although  his endorsement of you has been a great benefit to you and your campaign  and the polls and even in fund raising?  </p><p> REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FL.:  Well, Dagen, I mean -- you know, in some of  these things with the political back and forth, you've got to be able to  take a step back and just kind of laugh at the situation, have a little fun  with it.  So that's what we were trying to do.</p><p> It is a way to introduce voters to my wife, who is my best friend and best  supporter and our kids, because that's an important part of who I am.   Obviously we've run ads previous to this, talking about my military  service, talking about my conservative credentials.</p><p> But when you have nonstop ads in a primary season, you know, I think it's  good to just kind of take a step back, be able to laugh at yourself a  little bit and have a little fun with it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- the joke has always been that politicians go on  the campaign trail and hold babies.  But you're using a baby, your son, in  that ad to maybe make people feel good.  No?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, look, everyone has said, you know, wow, your wife's  beautiful, your kids are so cute and everything and they are.  I mean I'm  very, very proud of my family.  We love to get them on the campaign trail  as much as possible.</p><p> It's not the easiest thing in the world when your daughter is 20 months  because she's very active.  My son is pretty much go with the flow so  that's a little bit easier.  But just a really, really central part of my  life and I wanted to let voters get an introduction to them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- do you disagree with President Trump on any  policy ideas?  Can you name one?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  I don't agree with anybody on everything 100 percent of the  time.  What I've typically done though with the President is talk to him  privately rather than go kowtow -- I mean the easiest way to get a  microphone in your face in Washington is to bash the President if you're a  Republican for CNN and NBC and \"New York Times\".  I don't think that's  constructive.</p><p> But there are obviously things that I have disagreed.  But you do it  constructively and you try to -- you try to move the ball forward as best  you can.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you care to mention any of those things you've had  constructive conversations with?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well Dagen -- one of them that we would probably agree with is,  you know, I'm not a fan of farm subsidies.  And you know, to throw billions  of dollars in farm subsidies, I want to get away from doing that, you know.   So there's just an honest disagreement.</p><p> There are people in the Republican conference who we disagree with on those  things.  So it's fine.  But you agree with most of what's going on.  You  just try to press forward as best you can.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that $12 billion in farm subsidies is to offset any hit  that, say, farmers, soybean farmers and the like would face because of the  retaliatory tariffs from China as we've gotten into this tariff fight --  trade fight with China.  Also the steel and aluminum tariff play into some  of the retaliation from allies like Canada.</p><p> But do you agree with that approach?  Trade is expected to play a big role  in the GOP primary.  China threatened additional retaliatory tariffs  against an array of agricultural products that would impact your state.</p><p> So if you're against farm subsidies, are you against what the President has  done in terms of tariffs and the fight that we're beginning to wage with  some trading partners?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, I tell you, I MEAN I think I've been surprised at some of  the success HE'S gotten.  I've typically not been somebody that has  supported tariffs.  And I don't think that's the end state that you want.</p><p> But I think he's leveraged that like he did with the European Union to get  concessions.  And so if that's what he's able to do, then that's probably  going to benefit a lot of folks.</p><p> If the concessions aren't there, then I think you're going to be in a  situation where you're going to have to change course.  But using it to  negotiate, it was not something that a lot of us had thought about  previously.  He really believes in doing it and I think that he's been able  to get some concessions.  So I think we'll see how it goes going forward.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because I was going to mention that Adam Putnam is the  agriculture secretary in the state, so this will be an issue in terms of  any impact on the agriculture sector in Florida.  And critically important,  it's one of the biggest pieces of the Florida economy.</p><p> Are people calling your office as a congressman from the state and  complaining about the fallout on them, whether they're farmers or not,  about the trade fight that's just beginning this year?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Not really.  I mean I think that there's some folks who are very  supportive of doing it politically because they think this has gone on too  long.  There's other folks who are concerned but want to give the President  some runway.  So, you know, we'll see how things develop.   </p><p> But I would say, Dagen -- ag has been a big part of Florida's economy,  obviously tourism.  I think the thing for the next governor is, you know,  how do you expand the economic base?  I think we're primed to do very well  in financial services.  Why would you start a hedge fund right now in  Connecticut or New York given that the SALT deduction is gone?  We don't  have income tax in Florida.  We have a very good regulatory climate,  positive.  We've got to do some other things.</p><p> But I think you're going to see Florida with the right policies, really  expand economic opportunities in a variety of industries and that's  exciting.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- a brewing border battle, President Trump doubling  down yesterday on his threat of a government shutdown for lack of border  wall funding, saying he would, quote, \"certainly be willing to close down  the government.\"</p><p> One administration official now says -- tells the \"Wall Street Journal\" the  President has agreed to delay that fight over border security until after  November's midterm elections.  Congressman -- how critical is border  protection and building that wall for Republican voters this fall?  And  would you stand by a shutdown if it happens before the midterms?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, I think one of the disappointments in the Congress,  frankly, is we still to this day have not done much to push for the border  wall.  We did have the Goodlatte bill that got 193 votes in the House.   This is one of the President's central promises.  We should have moved this  in January of 2017.</p><p> So now at this stage, whether that's the right inflection point to do it, I  don't know.  But I will tell you this.  It will probably be harder to get  all our voters out to the polls in November as a result of the Congress not  following through.</p><p> You know, many of us wanted to follow through with it but we actually never  got that across the finish line and I think that there's been a lot of good  things done but I think that is definitely something that could bite some  of our members in the behind.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You mean if the border wall is not funded?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Yes, or to not each have fights over it.  I mean, you know, it's  one thing if we're really pushing for it, we're passing it in the House,  it's in the senate, they're debating on it, voting on it.  And then you  have a couple of these Democrat senators in Trump states.  If they're  voting to filibuster it, then you take that issue to the voters.  You can  try to make a change.</p><p> But you know, we haven't even been willing to have the fight yet and I  think that that frustrates a lot of folks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But would you get behind a shutdown if it meant shutting down  the government in order to get that border funding, that wall funding?  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Well, what the House would do is -- I mean we would either fund  it or not.  I mean we would not be the ones that would, quote, \"shut down\"  government.  We would pass a funding bill presumably that has funding for  the wall and I would support the funding.  And then it would go to the  senate and the question would be I think the President would say make sure  this is in there, otherwise I'm not going to sign it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> DESANTIS:  I think it will be -- it will fall to those Democratic senators  and see how they react.  And you've got to be nimble on these things.  I  mean you've got to have political sense to it.  So we would have to see how  it goes up.</p><p> But I think we should definitely put that in whatever funding mechanism we  send over to the senate.  But I can tell you if we do another omnibus bill  that's put together at the last minute and packed with spending; and  there's no border security that is going to be a bad thing for a Republican  Congress to do.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And President Trump after you signed the last one did reiterate  that he would not sign another one unless it funded the border wall.</p><p> Thank you -- Congressman.  Congressman Ron DeSantis.  We'll be watching  this evening as President Trump heads to Tampa.  </p><p> DESANTIS:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Chipotle taking another hit.  Shares of the burrito  chain sinking after one of its restaurants was shut down over reports of  customers getting sick.  Details on that.  Plus Chipotle's big giveaway  today.</p><p> Money in the bank -- why millennials' preference for cash over stocks could  be costing them big time.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The earnings parade continues as investors look over results  from Pfizer and some other big names.</p><p> Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Dagen.</p><p> Pfizer's latest results came in better than expected as the company raises  its profit outlook for the entire year.  but Pfizer also cut the revenue  outlook due to the stronger dollar.  Pfizer shares are under pressure now  in the pre-market, down a little more than three-quarters of a percent  right now.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble just out with better than expected earnings per share but  revenue came in just short of expectations.  Shares of P&amp;G are lower ahead  of the opening bell, down almost 2 percent.</p><p> We are also watching this morning the FANG stocks -- Facebook, Apple --  Apple of course getting earnings after the bell -- Amazon, Netflix and  Google's parent Alphabet.  The Nasdaq composite closed down nearly 1.5  percent yesterday on growth concerns about the technology sector in  general.</p><p> That's as one closely watched index of the FANG stocks slid into correction  territory -- excuse me -- yesterday, the NYSE FANG Index.  So we're  watching a lot of these names in particular today.</p><p> Also watching this for you -- more trouble at Chipotle.  The chain has shut  down a restaurant in Ohio following reports of as many as 12 customers  getting sick after they ate there.  Some customers detailed their illness  on the food safety Web site, iwaspoisoned.com.  Chipotle says that it is  working now with local health officials to reopen the store as soon as  possible.</p><p> Well, a number of food safety issues since 2015, you may remember have hurt  the restaurant's stock and obviously its reputation.  Anyway shares of  Chipotle dropped about 1.5 percent yesterday.  We should, of course, be  watching the stock today.</p><p> Also today, lighter note, it's free guacamole day at Chipotle, just in case  you're wondering.  They're celebrating national avocado day.  They're not  going to be charging extra for their very popular guacamole, especially  when you order it online with an entree.  You have to type in the seven- digit code \"avocado\" -- pretty simple.</p><p> All right.  A woman wants to take Canada Dry to court over ginger ale.  She  filed a lawsuit against Canada Dry and its parent company Dr. Pepper  Snapple Group claiming that Canada dry lies to its customers with the name  ginger ale because it doesn't actually have any ginger in it.</p><p> The woman says this is false advertising because Canada Dry promises  consumers the health benefits of ginger.  Similar lawsuits have previously  been filed in Missouri, Massachusetts, California and Texas.  Bring on the  lawyers -- Dagen.</p><p> Those are your headlines.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> Kat Timpf is over here making a face.  She's making the same face -- again,  this society, the people -- what they sue over, it makes me crazy.  </p><p> TIMPF:  Imagine taking time out of your life to sue a pop company, period.   Just imagine over ginger ale that doesn't have ginger in it -- yes, I'm  from Michigan.  Ginger ale doesn't have ginger it.  Don't they have like  friends and -- or even, you know, a show they like on Netflix to watch?   Don't they have things to do?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Kat Timpf.  That's why I went to you.</p><p> Coming up, crossing party lines, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin becoming  the first in his party to sit down with Supreme Court nominee Brett  Kavanaugh.  Why other Democrats could soon follow.</p><p> And a touching moment amid the destruction.  One little girl handing out  burritos to firefighters battling the Carr Fire in California.  We've got  more of this heart-warming video for you, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Paul Manafort heading to court -- jury selection beginning today  for President Trump's former campaign chairman.  If convicted, he could  face decades in prison on bank and tax fraud charges.  This is the first  case arising from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.</p><p> Joining us now, former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy.  Andy -- could  this -- how will this even trial have an impact on the course of Mueller's  investigation?  </p><p> ANDREW MCCARTHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  You know, it really won't have  any.  The more you think about it, the less I think it will.  The thought  up until now has been -- and it's probably still true -- that Mueller is  trying to squeeze Manafort to see if he's got anything on Trump in  connection with collusion.</p><p> But if you think about it, Mueller has had Richard Gates as a witness for  months.  Gates was Manafort's partner through all of the shenanigans that  he's on trial for, right.  You have to -- and plus, Gates came into Trump's  campaign with Manafort.  So it would be hard to believe that there's  something that Manafort has about the campaign and any connection with  Russia that Gates doesn't already have and was not already in a position to  give to Mueller.</p><p> So, you know, I think they went down this road with Manafort.  All of the  interesting thing is, this may be a test of Mueller's prosecution but it's  not really a test of his investigation.  The rational for the investigation  is any interference by Russia in the election and any connection that the  Trump campaign may have had in that.  This trial has nothing to do with  that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And this is the first of two trials.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  Correct.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's another trial that's going to happen in the District of  Columbia.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  Right.  And that one doesn't have anything to do with the  rational for the investigation either.  The reason there's two trials is  Manafort objected to being tried for everything including some tax charges  that he's entitled to have in a particular venue.  Most people would want  to have one trial where it all gets hammered out there.  He decided to push  for two.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you're Rudy Giuliani though would you wait until after all  this is done to make a decision about allowing the President to potentially  sit down for an interview though.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  No.  If I was Rudy, I wouldn't let the President sit down for an  interview.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you for that very short answer -- Andy.</p><p> Switching gears to breaking party lines -- Democratic Senator Joe Manchin  meeting with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh yesterday, becoming the  first in his party to sit down with President Trump's pick for the high  court after the two met on Capitol Hill.  The West Virginia senator  described the meeting as productive.</p><p> Vice President Mike Pence explained why the President chose Kavanaugh  during that exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo last week.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The President of the  United States, in this deliberation, he was looking for a judge with  extraordinary credentials and intellect.  But also a judge who would  strictly interpret the constitution as written and not legislate from the  bench.</p><p> Judge Brett Kavanaugh has that judicial philosophy.  He has a proven  record.  That's what the President made this nomination about.  That's the  message we'll carry to Republicans and Democrats in the Senate.  </p><p> And we remain confident that before the fall is out, that Judge Brett  Kavanaugh will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly were the  three Democrats who voted for Neil Gorsuch.  Do you expect all of these  three to get onboard or even more, we heard from Rand Paul yesterday, he's  a yea vote on Brett Kavanaugh to be on the court.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  Yes, I do.  I think that in fact, the dynamic going on inside  the Democratic Party now may actually draw more moderate Democrats toward  Kavanaugh because there's I think in the places where they're running,  which are states that Trump won, some places like Indiana where he won by a  lot -- there's a lot of pressure on those Democrats to distinguish  themselves from the sort of flavor of the month that we have of the hard  progressive left, particularly the woman who won in New York.  And I think  that's going to push those people to show that they're more reasonable and  ready to work with the other side.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There's 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in Trump  states come November.  And again, if you vote against Brett Kavanaugh, you  do appear as if you're taking orders from Chuck Schumer.  </p><p> MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Well, the problem they have is Kavanaugh is an excellent  judge.  If it wasn't for the infusion of politics in this, if it was just  his craftsmanship, his ability as a lawyer and his reputation in his life,  this would be a no-brainer.  It should be 100-0 confirmation.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Andrew McCarthy -- great to see you.  Andy -- be well.  Come  back soon.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're around now so we see you all the time.</p><p> MCCARTHY:  I am around.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Love it.</p><p> Coming up to the Rocketman nickname, North Korea is said to be pressing  ahead with building new missiles, according to U.S. spy agencies.  We have  the details.</p><p> Plus, taking the money -- why millennials' preference for cash over stocks  could be costing them millions.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p> Big names reporting earnings this week and especially today.  Three Dow  components out today, Procter &amp; Gamble out with results a short while ago,  out with some mixed numbers.  The Procter &amp; Gamble beat on earnings but  missed on the revenue.  And that stock is down more than 2.5 percent right  now.  </p><p> Pfizer beat expectations on the top and bottom line but it did cut its  revenue outlook.  That stock is down by half of one percent.  </p><p> The big report out to watch, Apple this afternoon.  Apple shares are moving  up slightly in premarket trading, one-third of one percent.  Will Apple's  results if they're good give all tech stocks a lift?  Because so far,  Facebook and Twitter have fallen out of bed big-time.  Some of these tech  stocks if you throw all the fang stocks in, Facebook, Amazon, Apple,  Netflix, Google, they're in correction territory, down more than 10 percent  from the record highs in June.  </p><p> Right now, we look at Futures across the board gains, 26 point gain on the  Dow Futures, despite those moves lower on Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer.  </p><p> The markets yesterday red across the board.  Big losses on the NASDAQ  Composite yesterday, down more than one percent.  </p><p> In Europe right now, we've had some buying to report, in England, France  and Germany.  Germany's stock market dipping lower at the moment.  </p><p> Asia markets finishing mostly in the green, Hang Seng losing about half of  one percent.  </p><p> New satellite images showed North Korea might be making new missiles.  This  just weeks after the historic summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong- un and President Trump.  The Department of Homeland Security creating a new  cyber hub, it will guard the nation's banks, energy companies and other  industries from cyber attacks.  We'll discuss that with Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in the next hour.  </p><p> Plus, the Carr Fire in California has become the seventh most destructive  in the state's history.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I lost it all, every bit of it.  I'm sorry.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's OK -- it's OK.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  If you live in California, you need to be prepared.   It's going to be a long, long summer.  It's only July.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The blaze has destroyed almost 1,000 structures with more than a  dozen people missing.  We have more details and how one little girl is  trying to make a difference, coming up.  </p><p> And with millennials taking hits from every generation lately, there's that  video of that little girl handing out burritos, we'll show you more of  that.  </p><p> To millennials, they can't -- they can't catch a break from any other  generation.  But it might surprise you where they're investing their money,  is it smart?  We debate.  </p><p> Now on to our top story this half an hour.  Not following through, new  satellite images reveal North Korea is expanding and continuing production  at a missile facility, increasing fears that the rogue regime has no plans  to pursue denuclearization.  </p><p> Joining us now, former CIA trained intelligence operative, former navy  pilot, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea, your response to this --  your take on this report?  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I don't think that it  necessarily indicates that North Korea will not work with us on  denuclearizing.  I think that the bottom line is that, you know, the summit  that occurred between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, they laid out sort  of a ground work agreement.  They said we will work towards  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p> But you can't expect a country that believes that its lifeblood, that  believes that nuclear weapons, what it's expected to be able to protect it  as a nation, that they would just give up those nuclear weapons and they  would just stop progress in developing nuclear weapons off of one summit  and one sort of loose agreement.  I think that the president in conducting  that summit, his intention was let's start talking, let's start a  conversation.  </p><p> Secretary Pompeo has testified on the Hill that we are aware that the North  is continuing to work towards developing its nuclear weapons technology but  our diplomats are continuing to have conversations with North Korea to come  up with a longer term agreement.  </p><p> So, I think that's what our focus should be right now is what progress can  be made and also I think we just don't know what Kim Jong-un is thinking.   Does he want to be brought into the fold of western countries?  Does he  want to become a more modern country?  Or does he want to remain in  isolation?  And we just don't know the answer to that yet, Dagen.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Do you think that was a mistake  that it was a loose agreement, that there weren't specific details within  the agreement at that were made at the summit?  Do you think we took a step  back?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think it would have been great if we could have 100 percent  gotten North Korea to agree to give up their entire nuclear weapons program  that they've been developing for so many years, that would have been  awesome of President Trump.  </p><p> But that's not what the president does.  The president is an executive.  He  comes up with loose agreements.  He brings countries together and has these  conversations and then he brings in the people who work for him who are  experts in the field to work out the details.  That's how these agreements  are done.  </p><p> So I don't think it was a mistake.  I think he started the conversation and  the question is whether or not North Korea is genuine in wanting to work  with us and wanting to work with South Korea and wanting to become into the  fold of -- you know, other nations.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Lea, we gave up something in that negotiation.  We gave up --</p><p> GARBRIEL:  We did.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- this joint military exercises.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  You know, with the North Koreans continuing to build, does  that tell you maybe we gave up too much?  Because they really haven't moved  besides giving back these remains.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  So, first let me correct you.  Because we didn't actually give  up our exercises.  We decided to halt them, right.  We can always turn  those exercises back on.  We've been doing them for a very long time with  South Korea.  And we work really well with South Korea.  So, we didn't give  them up.  You were going to say something.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No, and he mentioned the return of the remains of those killed  during the Korean War. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is very significant, particularly the families and anybody  who has ever served this country.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Absolutely it is.  And of course, those remains -- you know,  I'm skeptical of them.  In the past and North Korea has been accused of  throwing animal bones in those boxes.  And so, those remains will be  tested, hopefully they'll be identified.  But that is a very strong act of  goodwill and it's just the beginning.  </p><p> I mean, there are so many remains that are there in North Korea that  families will want to get in there and have people be part of recovering.   But that's a good point, that that was part of what's happened since the  summit.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Just to press on this point about giving up the exercises, we  can -- we can renew them any time.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But does it affect our preparedness if we're not doing them  now.  If you go a certain period of time without doing them, are you ready  for some kind of military confrontation?  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  And that's a great point.  Of course it affects your  preparedness.  You know, we saw how military preparedness was affected with  sequestration and how it does damage our military and our ability to  respond immediately to threats if we're not doing exercises.  </p><p> That being said, we can turn those back in a heartbeat and President Trump  knew that when he decided to halt them.  But they've been a big aggravating  factor for Kim Jong-un.  He believes that they are -- that they are  exercises to invade North Korea, which they are not.  But it was basically  to stop the aggravation, hey, let's come together, let's see what we can  work out here.  </p><p> And now, it's down to the -- you know, the smaller conversations that are - - that were -- are not as going to be public among our diplomats and there  is -- when you look at what's being done this particular facility  (INAUDIBLE), you know, this is the facility where the longest range  intercontinental ballistic missiles were developed, the ones that are  believed to be able to strike the U.S.  Although, we know, as far as our  technology is concerned, we don't believe that they have re-entry vehicles  at this point that can bring that punch to the U.S. yet.  </p><p> So, there is of course concern about what we're seeing in these new images.   But I don't think this is a surprise to our intelligence community.  It's  certainly not a surprise to Secretary Pompeo.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But there are a number of stories that have come out.  There was  one that there was -- there were images reportedly showing that North Korea  was dismantling a key test site.  There was earlier report right after the  summit that President Trump had that North Korea was continuing to enrich  uranium.  So, there's a lot that's playing out in the press.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But we don't really know any much about the discussions that  have gone on so far.  And one of the critical things that General Jack  Keane said on this program last week, that a key denominator must be that  North Korea hand over the location and identity -- ad identify all the  nuclear and ballistic missile test sites.  </p><p> And quite frankly in the past, North Korea has wanted sanctions relief,  they want the carrots and then delay -- they want the carrots up front.   And so, if they're coming to us and wanting any kind of sanctions relief,  then we should -- we should demand the location of all of these test sites  and quite frankly, maybe a time frame.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  And this is exactly why these types of negotiations are so  difficult and can't be done on a single summit.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I mean, it takes time to work through those issues.  North  Korea, as I said before, believes that North -- that its nuclear weapons  technology is its lifeblood, believes that it needs that to protect itself  as a country.  </p><p> So, we can't expect North Korea to just all of a sudden bend and fold.   This is going to be a negotiations process.  </p><p> KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Do you think that President Trump is a  little bit too optimistic when it comes to this?  Because it is going to be  a long process.  And they have in the past promised things and they've not  followed through on those things.  That would not be a big surprise.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's a great point, I think the question is, is President  Trump really that optimistic or is it what his public statements are versus  what he's actually really thinking.  </p><p> TIMPF:  Right. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think what he's trying to do is show goodwill towards North  Korea and I think he's making public statements that do that.</p><p> In my experience with diplomacy, there's public diplomacy and then there's  private diplomacy.  There's what you say, you know, behind the scenes.  And  then there's what you say publicly to encourage the country to work with  you.  </p><p> And then the question is, is North Korea genuine?  We don't know the answer  to that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Will point out that he did tweet after that summit, and again,  we talk about Twitter, it's his form of communication, there's no longer a  nuclear threat from North Korea.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, I think people knew that that was, well, President Trump  just being President Trump.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to read you this and get your reaction to it.  The head  of Iran's strategic council on Foreign Relations says that Tehran sees no  value in Trump's offer for negotiations.  This is actually the front page  story in the Wall Street Journal today that President Trump is opening --  open to meeting -0 and meeting the leaders of Iran.  I wanted to get your  reaction to that.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think the reaction -- my reaction to that is just that Iran  is essentially trying to go toe to toe and use the same type of tactic that  President Trump uses with countries against President Trump, taking this  hard line approach.  But in the past we've seen this rhetoric fly.  We've  seen a lot of saber-rattling and then sometimes we see these offers to have  a conversation work.  So, it's yet to be determined.  </p><p> But Iran has really been trying to spread its wings, it's been -- it's been  spreading its influence in the region.  Iran has not been showing a desire  to work with the U.S. and to sort of settle back on some of its regional --  its regional activities.  When you look at places like Syria, you look at  places like Iraq, Iran has been a really big problem.  So, it doesn't  surprise me that they're reacting this way.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, we know one thing, that money talks and, well, chitchat  walks.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we're getting ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran, it's  starting in August.  And we have essentially threatened to also put the  hammer down on Europe, any European nations and countries -- and companies  that do business with Iran.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  And of course, Russia is one of the ones we have to be  concerned with.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  In working with Iran.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, but President Trump did reiterate that there will be no  sanctions relief on Russia, and potentially more sanctions coming on  Russia.  So again, it's all about the moolah.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  It is about the money, when you put pressure on the country  economically, that's where we've seen them bend in the past and fold.  So,  it's to be determined how this is going to play out at this point.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lea Gabrielle, thank you Lea.  Great to see you.  You coveres a  lot of ground for us.</p><p> Coming up, waging war on a wildfire, the Carr Fire in Northern California  now burning so hot it's created its own weather system.  We take you live  to Redding, California, for an update.  </p><p> Plus, a touching moment amid the devastation, one little girl handing out  burritos to firefighters battling that devastating blaze.  We've got more  of this heart-warming video for you, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The deadly California wildfires still burning out of control,  that fire so powerful it's creating its own weather system, making  containment all the more difficult for more than 12,000 firefighters.  </p><p> Our own Hillary Vaughn live in Redding, California to give us an update on  the very latest.  Good morning, Hillary.  </p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   Over a dozen wildfires burning throughout the state.  The Carr Fire that  tore through this Redding neighborhood has already killed six people, it's  displaced thousands and it's leveled entire communities.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's pointing to the ashes, saying fire, so she  knows, they know what's going on, they just don't know how severe it is and  we're doing everything to keep them in that state of mind where they're  happy and we're freaking out.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I lost it all, every bit of it, I'm sorry.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's OK -- it's OK.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's been a hell of a month for our firefighters.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> VAUGHN:  This fire has morphed into one of California's most destructive  and deadly already in the top 10, the most damaging fires the state has  ever seen.  16 states around the country have donated resources to help  fight these fires in California.  </p><p> But even with the extra hands, firefighters are dealing with one of the  most erratic fires that they have ever confronted, giving birth to a new  phenomenon that even has some meteorologists curious.  (INAUDIBLE) a giant  fire cloud ominously looming over a community that is struggling to stay  standing, the giant cloud can trigger its own internal thunderstorm,  creating its own weather, making it very unpredictable.  </p><p> And also, here in Redding, a tornado of fire, some are calling it a fire- nado, charging towards this town in a death spiral, whipping flames of fire  at whirling speed and destroying everything in its path.  Now, firefighting  efforts have ramped up to a small scale military operation.  The National  Guard deployed 800 soldiers and airmen, providing tactical backup on the  ground and also Blackhawks and (INAUDIBLE) tracking the fires from the air  and it's not carrying weapons, they're carrying tons and tons of fire  retardant, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hillary, thank you for that reporting, Hillary Vaughn there.  It  makes you realize how hard these firefighters work.  Before somebody gets  up in the morning, complains about their job, you better think about these  men and women putting their lives at risk in California and quite frankly,  police officers, firefighters every day across this fine nation.  </p><p> And we want to show you this truly touching moment among all the  devastation and destruction in Northern California.  This video was posted  to Facebook.  It shows a little girl handing out burritos to firefighters  battling the Carr Fire.  Watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at this.  Hi.  Thank you.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  Just one act of kindness among many that have  emerged in the wake of these fires.  We love to see that.  But that's  America.  That's America.  </p><p> Coming up, money in the bank, why millennials' preference for cash over  stocks could cost them, big-time.  That's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  A new Bankrate.com report shows that millennials prefer cash  investments over the stock market.  </p><p> Meantime, unlike their younger counterparts, older Americans prefer the  stock market as a long-term investment.  </p><p> Joining us now the author of Retired Inspired and Ramsey's Solution  financial expert, Chris Hogan.  Why do you think millennials favor cash  over the stock market, Chris?  </p><p> CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION:  Dagen, I think it's  because cash is real.  It's something they can see, they can touch it, they  understand how it works and where it goes.  I think when dealing with the  stock market, they don't understand it.  And people tend to avoid and not  use what they don't understand.  </p><p> BELL:  Hey, Chris, it's Lindsey Bell here.  Another thing that survey  showed was that the interest in investing in homes, in real estate, has  really dwindled among the millennial crowd.  What do you make of that?  </p><p> HOGAN:  I think for millennials, they want to be mobile.  They don't want  to be tied down.  They're not ready to make the long-term commitment just  yet.  Studies have shown, they prefer experiences over items.  So, I think  it's OK for them to rent, renting is not necessarily a bad thing.  It  allows you to save up and buy a home when you're ready to settle down,  start a family or remain in an area for three to five years or more.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well (INAUDIBLE) maybe people of your generation and Lindsey's  generation are risk averse for a reason.</p><p> BELL:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because they saw home prices collapse during the financial  recession, depression back in 2008 and the stock market collapse.  </p><p> TIMPF:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, what's wrong withholding some cash even though it's not  earning you anything?  </p><p> TIMPF:  Absolutely.  It is difficult after you see those kinds of things  throughout your life repeatedly to say all right, yes, I'm going to jump  in.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Chris?  </p><p> HOGAN:  Well, I think, you know, we definitely want to understand that  having cash and saving is a good thing for an emergency fund.  It's just  not a good long range plan.  </p><p> For example, the national average savings rate is two percent.  So if  you're parking a big chunk of money in a savings account and expecting  growth, that's unrealistic.  </p><p> So, savings is good but investing is better.  We need to be able to outpace  inflation.  So millennials need to understand this.  Baby boomers need to  understand this.  Looking at inflation hovering between 3.5 and four  percent, if you're parking money in a savings account and getting two  percent, it means your money is shrinking not growing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you -- go ahead, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I was -- I was just going to say -- I mean, there's an  irony here.  Because stocks outperform cash and they outperform bonds in  the long run.  Millennials are younger than Gen X or (INAUDIBLE) or baby  boomers.  So, they have time to ride out -- you know, another decline in  the stock market.  So, it makes sense to the end stocks if you're a younger  investor.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Chris, do you agree with that?</p><p> HOGAN:  I really do.  I mean especially if you look at and understand, the  stock market is like the supermarket.  There are things that you can invest  in that are good for you, there are things that you can invest in that are  more risky.  But it's like riding a roller coaster.  When you're invested,  there're going to be some ups and downs.  But if you're investing the right  way, your portfolio will be able to withstand it and even grow during those  times.  </p><p> So, investing is a long range approach.  You have to think of it that way.   And don't look and watch every little ticker symbol and all the little  emblems and adjustments that happen, it will cause you heartburn.  Don't  have heartburn and headache.  Have a game plan, long term, work with an  investment professional.  Understand what you're investing in and get ready  to win.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Chris, good to see you as always.  We agree today.  I'll find  some we disagree about next time.  Chris Hogan.</p><p> HOGAN:  I'll look forward to it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A financial hangover, we'll tell you how much drunken online  spending is costing Americans every year.  And what -- and why what you  drink impacts how much you spend, next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top  stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Earnings driving the action on Wall Street,  three Dow components reporting today and mixed picture so far but Apple is  the number one in focus.  That tech giant's results after closing bell  today.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the tech wreck.</p><p> Key stocks entering correction territory, down 10 percent or more from  their recent highs.  Checking the market action this morning, we have a 30- point gain on Dow futures, green across the board on the Dow, S&amp;P, and  NASDAQ 100.  This after a different story yesterday, declines across the  board with the NASDAQ composite being the hardest hit despite.  But recent  weakness all of the major market gages.</p><p> Including the Dow transports and the Russell 2000 are on track for monthly  gains as we wrap up July today.  In Europe we've had some mixed markets  right now, the DAX of the three major markets there is in negative  territory, ever so slightly.  And reading on the Eurozone economy showing  slowing growth in the second quarter.  In Asia overnight, markets heading  higher across the board.  The only loser there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p> The Bank of Japan surprising investors by keeping its monetary policy  unchanged.  Protecting our border.  President Trump doubling down on his  calls for a government shutdown if funding is not approved. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One new development according to the Wall Street Journal, a  change in the timeline?  The President reportedly putting a shutdown on  hold until after the midterm elections.  We will hear from Homeland  Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus cybersecurity later this  hour.  And President Trump is speaking tonight in Tampa.  What will he say  then?  You have to watch Fox Business to find out.</p><p> Not taking the bait.  Kim Kardashian appearing on Jimmy Kimmel last night  where she was asked about her Oval Office visit.  What she said about the  Commander-in-Chief coming up.  The warning about drinking and shopping.   You won't believe how much people are spending online after throwing back a  few.  Whiskey drinkers are the most frugal.  We'll tell you what type of  drinkers are the biggest spenders.</p><p> We have Kat Timpf here to weigh in on that.  And so much more this morning.   She's a Fox News Contributor, Wall Street Journal Economics Editor Jon  Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.   Nothing wrong with that though because you know what, online, you can  return almost anything.  </p><p> KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, absolutely.  Except I never do  because it's too complicated.  You got to put it back in the package, you  got walk downstairs, well, tick the elevator but still you got to wait for  elevator rather than stay on couch.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We weigh in.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  To hear how bourbon  drinkers fair in this whole --</p><p> TIMPF:  I'm a tequila drinker myself, so --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Tequila will get you into trouble.  Just saying.  So many  ways.  But first, two more Dow companies out with earnings this morning.   All eyes will be on Apple, that company reports after the will be.  Nicole  Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Hey, Nicole.  </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, guys.   All right.  Note to self.  No drinking and shopping.  Looking at the  earnings overall.  So, so far we're beating for estimates overall, tech in  particular is worrisome.  But let's take a look at these Dow components.   So Pfizer, this is to the downside this morning.  They beat on profit, they  did well with the pneumonia vaccine or arthritis drug.</p><p> But the truth to the matter is that they lowered the revenue expectation  for 2018, that is down .3 percent.  Procter &amp; Gamble also to the downside.   Quarterly sales were below the estimates.  This is Gillette Razors.  This  whole grooming unit was a miss, and so that's also lowered, got to get to  tech.  When we talk about the FAANG index which I watch regularly here on  the big board.</p><p>  I talked to the traders, I talked to people who were managing money, they  all seem to say how important is Apple is after the bell.  Not only are we  to hear about the products, and what's going on in China, we're hearing  about strengthening dollar.  All of these things have factored in but tech  in particular has been selling off without any -- they're just selling it  all.  And so, if they sell off Apple, does that mean it breaks the trend  lines.</p><p> Because I talked to technical analysts too, watching the upwards trend line  of tech.  And now forget it.  This will be the last chance to hold on to  tech, that's what they're saying.  So they've made this very, very severe  for today's afternoon numbers.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  Lindsey Bell, really quickly on  this.  To point this out, we talk about this 10 percent correction in this  FAANG index, this is the second time it happened this year.  And also it  last happened three years ago.  So again, you want to talk about stocks  that have been able to recover from these past he sell-offs in recent years  worth noting.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Exactly.  And you've seen --  like I said earlier, some of the stocks in this index have done really  well, Alphabet which is Google, Amazon, other stocks like Microsoft, AMD  like the -- there are names that are doing really well that I think can  lift this up.  It seems to be a social media issue more than an overall  tech issue.  And we saw what Amazon reported result, that stock went up,  lifted the group up.</p><p> We'll see if Apple can do same.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great.  Switching gears.  President Trump heading to Florida  later today where he is expected to tout strong economic growth at a  workforce event and a Make America Great Again rally.  Blake Burman joins  us live from the White House with more details.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  President Trump reiterating yesterday here at the White  House that he is willing to meet with just about anybody.  We've already  seen the President meet with leaders of North Korea, the President of  Russia as well.  And President Trump saying yesterday that he is also  willing to meet with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I don't do that from strength or from weakness.  I think it's an  appropriate thing to do.  If we could work something out that's meaningful,  not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be  willing to meet. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you have preconditions for that meeting?  </p><p> TRUMP:  No preconditions, no.  They want to meet, I'll meet anytime they  want.  Anytime they want.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did appear to lay out  some conditions in an interview yesterday saying that Iran needs to make it  known that it's worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement, change their  behavior in the Middle East and change how they treat their own people.  A  spokesperson for the National Security Council backed that up in a  statement saying that the U.S. would be willing to reestablish diplomatic  relations with Iran.</p><p> And could pull back sanctions but also warned the following, \"this relief  is only possible if there are tangible demonstrated and sustained shifts in  Tehran's policies until then the sting of sanctions will only grow more  painful if the regime does not change course.  The head of Iran Strategic  Council responding this morning by the way saying that Iran does not see  any value in the President's offer to sit down for negotiations.</p><p> Meantime, as well in the world stage today, Dagen, a U.S. official  knowledge of the intelligence assessment tells Fox this morning that the  latest assessment does show that North Korea is continuing to build its  missile capabilities up and that includes ICBM, the intercontinental  ballistic missiles.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman at the White House for us.  Here  now with reaction, Byron York, Washington Examiner Chief Political  Correspondent, Fox News Contributor.  Byron, we're less than 100 days away  from the midterm elections.  What are you listening for in tonight's rally  because there is so much on the President's plate each and every day.  And  when -- it seems like that his plate is full, he add something else.  </p><p> BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, if you talk Republican strategists  who were trying to help the Republican Party keep control of the House, you  know, they'll tell you they want him to talk about the economy, they want  him to talk a lot about the economy, they want to talk about how Democrats  want to get rid of ICE.  They want him to talk about immigration, they want  him to talk about the specter of Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House.</p><p> They want him to talk about all of that stuff.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Will he?  Because again --</p><p> YORK:  Well, among other things, yes.  I think -- I think he probably will  but go all over the place, but the -- a number of these strategists have  been kind of rattled by the last month.  They were pretty confident a month  ago if you talked to them but the whole border family separation thing  followed by the President's performance in Helsinki, really spooked some of  them.  </p><p> They've seen some of the President's numbers and key Congressional  districts go down with those independent voters they're trying to get.  So  they are worried about the amount of noise that comes out of the White  House at any given time but they really wish they could keep pushing  economy, ICE, Supreme Court, Nancy Pelosi, that kind of stuff.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President tweeted moments ago speaking of adding something  else to the list of topics this morning.  Collusion is not a crime.  That  doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked Hillary and  the Democrats.  Your reaction to that?  I'm sure that the \"strategists\"  don't want him tweeting about that but good luck telling the President what  to do.  </p><p> YORK:  Well, actually, the President has been pretty effective when -- with  this.  If you go back to the hiring of Rudy Giuliani and the beginning of  Rudy Giuliani kind of being the face of the President's defense and Emmet  Flood being the inside player on the President's defense.  By the way, when  is the last time anybody's heard Emmet Flood come out and say anything?   Does not happen.  They clearly got kind of a two-track effort going on.</p><p> And I think if you look at the polls showing the number of people who have  confidence in Robert Mueller and his investigation that has been slowly  ticking downwards since the President did this.  My guess is the President  is doing this because he thinks it works. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because you changed -- you get all the Democrats if you  listen to any of these other networks, they literally talk about Russia  non-stop.  They don't talk about anything that truly matters to anybody who  is working hard and trying to support their family in this country.  All  they talk about is Russia and who is getting interviewed by Mueller who is  subpoenaed.</p><p> And it's forcing the Democrats, they almost -- the Trump supporters want  the Democrats to talk about impeachment because he's a loser.  </p><p> YORK:  They absolutely do.  And I mean go back to 2006, if you remember,  George, the Iraq War was in terrible shape, George W. Bush very unpopular.   A number of Democrats were saying if we win the control of the House in  2006, there is going to be impeachment.  And it really did not fly and  Nancy Pelosi who wanted to be speaker, she turned out she did, basically  came out and said impeachment is off the table.</p><p> Now, there are a lot more Democrats who say that if the party wins, they  want Donald Trump impeached, but it's not working out that well in polls of  the general electorate.  So I think you're going to see a conflict inside  the Democratic Party in August, September, and October about how much to  emphasis the whole Trump-Russia thing.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Byron, you recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on  the escalating fear that's approaching as the midterms this fall becoming  increasingly imminent.  You write this.  Perhaps the biggest underlying  question of the coming elections is the relationship between presidential  job approval and the House GOP's reelection chances.  It's often observed  that Trump is keeping the favor of his base supporters.</p><p> He is but Republican -- something you just mentioned Republican strategists  are watching his approval sink.  In some educated affluent Congressional  districts with lots of independent voters, the party needs to hold the  House.  I mean, how do you reconcile these two because we were talking to  Congressman Ron DeSantis who's running for the governor of Florida earlier. </p><p> And President Trump's endorsement of this man, completely shifted the  momentum away from his Republican opponent and he has a double-digit lead  in the polls in Florida right now for the upcoming primary.  </p><p> YORK:  Absolutely turned it around for Ron DeSantis.  That is of course a  statewide race and all of the Congressional races are in the Congressional  districts.  But the big question of the midterms and nobody knows the  answer, the big question is what effect will the President's job approval  rating have on the voting?  In the past, we have generally seen the  President below 50 percent job approval rating.</p><p> It's harder for his party to keep the House.  They tend to lose more seats  but people wonder is Trump something different.  You have to remember, his  Donald Trump's personal disapproval rating was near year 60 percent on  Election Day, 2016 when he was elected.  And the number of smart  Republicans are saying, you know, I just don't know exactly how that works. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  When you say strategists, I have to chuckle, because, again,  President Trump won that election by being himself and doing what he wanted  to and he ignored I would say most strategists. </p><p> YORK:  Oh, absolutely.  The only thing here is Donald Trump is not on the  ballot, you might think that by listening to this campaign but he is not on  the ballot, so it's really unclear how the Trump effect will play out in  these midterms.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Byron York, always love seeing you, sir.  </p><p> YORK:  Thank you, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up.  Talk about a financial hangover.   The shocking new study that finds Americans spend more than $30 billion in  online shopping when they're drinking.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The president continues to tweet this morning.  He has written  this.  I am looking into 3D plastic guns being sold to the public already  spoke to the NRA doesn't seem to make much sense.  This comes after several  states are lining up to sue to stop these 3D plastic guns.  </p><p> Switching gears.  The housing market latest challenge finding young workers  to build homes.  Cheryl Casone has details on this story.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Dagen.  Good  morning.  Young people apparently don't want to work in construction, Wall  Street Journal reports the percentage of workers who are 24 years old or  younger has fallen in nearly the entire country since the last housing  boom.  That was back in 2005.  There is no single reason for the shortage.</p><p> But when economists in the industry says the problem is contributing to a  labor shortage, that results and fewer homes being built and rising prices  for buyers.  Shares of two home builders (INAUDIBLE) toll brothers are both  down sharply this year.  I mean, sharply look at that chart.</p><p> OK.  Well, in case you missed it.  Kim Kardashian-West defended President  Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night.  No matter how hard Kimmel tried to  get her to criticize the president.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> KIM KARDASHIAN-WEST, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY:  I walk in and I'm  like I look around and I'm kind of star struck from the Oval Office and the  first thing I say in our meeting, I say holy [bleep] we're in the [bleep]  Oval Office.  That's what I said.  That was the first thing I said and I  had to take a moment and be like, wait, we're really here.  I'm very  grateful and I'm very hopeful that more good things are going to come out  of our conversation.  </p><p> JIMMY KIMMEL, AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST:  Oh, do you have a list now of  people that you might ask him to release from prison?  </p><p> KARDASHIAN-WEST:  I do.  I've been working on it.</p><p> KIMMEL:  Is Melania on it?  I know that you're not necessarily a Trump  supporter, I know your husband Kenya seems to like him.</p><p> KARDASHIAN-WEST:  I always respect what other person thinks.  I have  nothing bad to say about the president.  </p><p> KIMMEL:  Right.  Because you still have people on the --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  She held her ground the whole interview, guys.  She met with  President back in may to discuss the release of Alice Johnson who is  serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug charge in Tennessee.  Johnson  sentence was commuted by the President in June and she was immediately  released from prison.</p><p> And then there is this.  A new study says that drunk Americans really enjoy  online shopping after knocking back a few.  Spending a total of $30 billion  online each year.  More importantly what they drink impacts how much they  spend.  While shopping on Amazon for instance, gin drinkers tend to spend  the most an average of more than $82.00.  Rum and vodka drinkers in second  and third place both spending 50 bucks.</p><p> Followed by those who drink white wine, red wine, tequila, beer and then  the last place, I don't know what this means. Folks, but whiskey drinkers  spend an average $39.00.  Are whiskey drinkers cheap?  I don't know.  Also  note, there is a surge of drunk shopping on Saturday morning around 2 a.m.   Shoes and lingerie, some of the more popular items that are bought of 1,000  people surveyed who reported purchasing an item off of Amazon.</p><p> While drinking, about 50 percent said yes, they later returned their  purchases.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  </p><p> CASONE:  I will send it over to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Your reaction, Kat Timpf.  </p><p> TIMPF:  I mean, I'm a tequila drinker but I've definitely spent more than  40 bucks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  You tequila drinkers are like out getting in fights with  people (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Just joking.</p><p> TIMPF:  You know, me and my bar fighting problem.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.  No, no, no.  I was just kidding.</p><p> TIMPF:  Never been in a fight.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But by the way, whiskey drinkers having grown up down south  bourbon drinkers having fun with friends, shooting pool, like socializing,  they're not home shopping.  </p><p> TIMPF:  Right.  Well, you know, --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Like -- unlike people in New York City who were drinking gin and  tonics alone on a Saturday night.  </p><p> TIMPF:  We can't all be popular.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you are popular, Kat.  Around here you are.  Coming up.   We're taking America from hackers.  The Department of Homeland Security has  created a new cyberhub.  We'll speak with the Homeland Security secretary  about that ahead.  Plus, crude awakening.  Why one expert is predicting oil  prices could surge to $400 per barrel.  We didn't make that up, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  B.P. reporting a surprising second quarter profit tripling it  $1.8 billion net gain.  This comes after the company announced a multitude  billion-dollar deal in the U.S.  Shale country here to discuss, PKVerleger  president and battle -- excuse, Brattle Group senior adviser, Philip  Verleger.  Philip, your thoughts on the state of the energy sector right  now and your protection for catastrophe?</p><p> PHILIP VERLEGER, SENIOR ADVISER, BRATTLE GROUP:  Catastrophe, yes.  Yes,  $400 is a -- is an extreme peak.  Look, I'm an economist.  B.P. has been  doing a really great job in reshaping itself since the Macondo accident.   And it's -- this is not surprising.  I mean, it's why I don't follow  company earnings.  The B.P. people have been working extraordinarily hard  to bring down costs and trying to bring the more production.</p><p> And it's -- B.P. is now leading among the super majors I think.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p> VERLEGER:  But -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Go ahead, Philip.  Finish your thought.  </p><p> VERLEGER:  Well, no, what I was going to say is -- I mean, it's -- and they  will do better for the next year, a year and half as crude prices rise.   You know, I don't see -- $400 is an extreme point and I used to it to make  a -- try to call people's attention to this obscure regulation that could  really upset the whole economy in 2000 -- you know, lead to a situation  where consumers were paying $6.00, $7.00 a gallon election day 2020.   Something nobody wants to see.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, just to explain that.  The International  Maritime Organization ruled that Phillip is talking about requires shippers  to use only low sulfur fuel which will shift five percent of global oil  demand away from high sulfur and toward low sulfur.  That's going to bring  oil prices to 2008 peaks by 2020.  Jon?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, Philip, I'd like to hear your explanation, you  put the $400 a barrel oil price out there.  How do you get to that and how  does this one obscure regulation get you to that kind of extreme  prediction?  </p><p> VERLEGER:  What it does is, you know, I laid out in 2005 why we're going to  see a $100 oil.  And the -- and same reason.  It -- what it does is it put  an extreme demand for low sulfur diesel fuel onto the refining system and  they can't produce it.  So what we're going to see is roughly a million to  a million and a half barrel a day, global decline in the use of diesel fuel  across the industrial sector.  That's what's needed to make the fuel for  the maritime organization.</p><p> For the -- for the shippers.</p><p> BELL:  But Philip --</p><p> VERLEGER:  It's --</p><p> BELL:  Lindsey Bell, I just -- is there -- you're talking about the  refiners having to change, you know, the way they refine the oil.  What  about --there's another alternative of shifts putting equipment onto their  -- to the boat to really address the emission issue.  Is that a more  efficient way, is that a possible way of addressing this issue?</p><p> VERLEGER:  Yes, Lindsey.  That's absolutely a way.  You can't -- what you  have to do is put the ship and dry if off and you put the scrubber material  in there.  So you scrub the fuel the way you scrub on a power plant.  Six  percent, maybe seven percent of the world shipping capacity will have  scrubber by 2020.  There are 60,000 to 80,000 ships they think maybe,  6,000, 6500 ships will have scrubbers.</p><p> But that leaves a huge number of ships not and many of the large shipping  companies are saying that they're going to rely on the oil industry to  provide the low sulfur oil.  Maersk has made that statement I believe and  as the big Costco shipping company from China.  So most of the, you know,  most of the shipping companies keep saying, look, it is a refiner's  obligation to do this.  The refiners aren't prepared to make it yet.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Philip, it's good to see you.  Please come back, sir, often.  </p><p> VERLEGER:  Yes.  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Philip Verleger.  More Trump tweets.  President Trump tweeting  again this.  We'll be in Tampa tonight.  A big year for Congressman  DeSantis who will be a great governor for Florida.  Strong on crime,  borders and our second amendment.  Big help on tax and regulation cuts.   Lovers our military and our vets.  Has my full and total endorsement.  Ron  DeSantis who we talked to last hour still has to go up against a  challenger.</p><p> The Secretary of Agriculture in the State of Florida.  That run -- that  primary in the Republican Party for the Republican nomination to run for  governor is in August.  However, President Trump's supporter Ron DeSantis  has really turned around things for DeSantis.  He as a double-digital lead  in the polls now.  Coming up.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  will join us.  She will weigh in on the department's security strategy,  immigration and much more.</p><p> Plus, a new warning for Morgan Stanley.  Why the firm is predicting the  biggest correction since February pointing to earnings misses from Facebook  and Netflix which are now in bear market territory, down more than 20  percent each from their recent highs.  We'll be right back.</p><p> DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL HOST:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report.  A special presentation for Fox Business.  I'm Dani  Klupenger.  Former number one Andy Murray made his return to the ATP World  Tour at the Citi Open Monday.  But the three-time major champion was far  from his bet.</p><p> Mackenzie McDonald took full advantage of a slow start from the Scott.   He's making his comeback after hip surgery.  The American closing out the  opener 6-3.  But  a slight struggling with his mobility.  Murray managed to  claw his lead back into the match, leveling it up after taking the second  6-4.  </p><p> Sheer determination got Murray across the finish line as he wraps up the  hard-fought win 7-5 deep in the decider.  But it doesn't get easier, up  next, countryman and top 20 star, Kyle Edmund.  And don't forget, Tennis  Channel's exclusive coverage of the city open from Washington D.C.  continues Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Three Dow  components among the big names reporting earnings today; Pfizer and Procter &amp; Gamble already out with their numbers, some mixed reports there.  But  this -- and you can see, Pfizer's stock down more than one percent.   Procter &amp; Gamble stock, this is premarket trading, down more than three  percent.  Again, it was a revenue miss for Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p> We've got Apple reporting this afternoon, however, will Apple be able to  turn around the likes of Facebook and Twitter?  Talk about Facebook and  Netflix, those stocks as of yesterday in bear market territory, they are  down more than 20 percent from their recent highs.  We'll see if Apple can  buck that trend.</p><p> Futures are showing this right now, we've had gains across the board all  morning, reversing losses yesterday, 24-point gain on the Dow Futures.   Numbers on personal income and spending, come -- just hitting the wires,  both personal income and spending rising four-tenths of one percent, in  line with the economists' expectations.  The core PCE Index which is the  Fed's chosen indicator for inflation, rising 1.9 percent compared to a year  ago.  So, based on that inflation, looks pretty tame.</p><p> In Europe, we look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains in -- on  the FTSE 100 in England and the CAC Quarante in France, the DAX heading  lower, losing one-quarter of one percent.  The Asian markets mostly higher,  the Hang Seng the only loser there, down half of one percent.  </p><p> Are the bears knocking at the door?  Analysts at Morgan Stanley say stocks  could be in for the biggest correction since February.  We have details  coming up on that.  Plus, building the wall, President Trump speaking out  again yesterday on securing America's borders.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Unlike President Obama, I just want great border security.  Our  countries have learned through hard experience that border security is  national security, they are one and the same.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President threatening a government shutdown over border  security funding but one administration official tells the Wall Street  Journal that the fight will happen after the midterm elections.  Roseanne  got the boot, Director James Gunn gets fired, one comedian says that we  should just take it easy and stop being so sensitive to everything.  You  cannot wait to hear from her.</p><p> And now, to the top story this half hour, protecting America, the  Department of Homeland Security hosting a cybersecurity summit today.   That's where we find Deirdre Bolton, she is live in New York City with the  Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.  Good morning, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   I certainly am.  And I pleased to welcome, of course, Secretary Nielsen.   Thank you so much for the time today.</p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  My  pleasure.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, you have this huge cybersecurity summit.  You are hosting it  today, you have the head of the FBI, you have the head of the NSA, you have  Vice President Mike Pence, and then you also have tons of business leaders,  CEOs from tech, and banking, and energy.  What is the biggest threat right  now to our infrastructure?</p><p> NIELSEN:  The biggest threat in my mind is if we don't partner.  So, what  we see the adversary is doing is they're crowdsourcing.  So, they're using  bots, they're using paid influencers, they're using their governments,  they're using anyone and everyone that can attack us.  So, the biggest  threat is if we don't work together to counter that.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, give me, if you don't mind, Secretary, in order of  aggressivity, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, unknown.  So, that's one  through five, who's attacking us the most?</p><p> NIELSEN:  OK.  So, it's a good question.  They all have slightly different  note.  So, I would say Russia is very active, they'll continue to be  active, we've seen meddling in the election, we've seen meddling with our  industrial control systems, we've seen meddling with routers.  China has  more of a long view, so they're looking more to understand our systems  particularly in government, understand who's who, get different access to  systems.  Iran we see very active and North Korea both but general in their  regions.  So, they have the capability, we know they have the intent but we  don't see them quite as active towards us.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, what's our response, what's our strategy?  You attack us, we  hit back 10 times as hard?  What can we do to take away an incentive to  keep trying to figure out our systems?</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes.  I mean, I (INAUDIBLE) we do have to move from complacency  to consequences and I think you've seen that.  So, whether it's through  legal means such as indictments, whether it's through sanctions through the  Treasury Department, whether it's through diplomatic means such as P&amp;G, we  have to have consequences for the activities.  We have to call them out and  hold them responsible.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, you're creating a risk management center, and it goes back to  this point about coordination, where you really feel the government and  private enterprise needs to be coordinated because some business leaders  have complained, like, even when I think I'm hacked I don't know who to  call.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p> BOLTON:  Is this the answer, the risk management center.</p><p> NIELSEN:  (INAUDIBLE) never call 911.  We saw that happened before  (INAUDIBLE) communities.  No, I think it is.  So, how it is now, we have  different intel that comes in so we collate at the government level, all  the intel unclass and classified.  But we needed the private sector  perspective to understand the context to which to imply that intel.  So,  for example, working very closely with the energy sector, the finance  sector, and the com sector, if we have a piece of intel, we can see how it  fits in to their operational environment and how it could affect them.   That helps us prepare, helps them prepare, and helps us be ready for the  systemic threats.</p><p> BOLTON:  So, you mentioned energy, I've heard some people say, parts of our  system are so old that it's actually hard to hack, but then we've seen  evidence of Russia actually having a certain amount of success in breaching  some ports which normally shouldn't have been breached.  How do you see it?</p><p> NIELSEN:  They're trying, for sure.  I mean, I think they have some  capabilities that's seen in Ukraine, they sort of continue to scan and  attempt to access our systems in the U.S.  There was one limited  distribution asset that they did attack.  It would not have had effect on  the larger grid, but your point is valid.  So, working very closely with  the Department of Energy and Secretary Perry will be joining us today to  help give the perspective from the energy sector.</p><p> BOLTON:  Of all the systems that we have, whether it's banking or whether  it's internet security, or whether it's the energy grid, what are you most  worried about?  What keeps you up at night in this cyber context?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I'm just worried about being behind, right?  So, they continue to  innovate daily, sometimes by the minute in terms of their different ways  that they're attacking us.  So, we have to keep up.  They're crowdsourcing  their attacks that I mentioned earlier so we have to have that partnership.   But really, it's evolving threats.  So, I worry that at given times, we  might not have the authority and resources we need to combat them  effectively.  So, it's moving towards our toes.</p><p> BOLTON:  When you talk about resources, what is it like for you to recruit  because I'm thinking of computer scientists coming out of MIT would  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, that's who you need.  You need these code breakers, you  need these hackers.  It's easier for them to go and work in Silicon Valley.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, it is.  It's much more lucrative.  We're working on a  variety of different initiatives, everything from exchanging partners with  the private sector, so we have a loan executive program, but we also  actually are doing something that I think is quite innovative which is  working with GSA to develop a whole new GSA system to hire federal  employees, that's really based on their skill sets in cyber which might not  necessarily equate to the traditional educational requirements.</p><p> BOLTON:  Now, I know as we talked about it, you have CEOs here.  How  cooperative is private enterprise with the government.  There's a lot of  people who don't trust the government.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Yes, it's taken the DHS about 15 years old, it's taken us  probably all 15 of those years to build up the trust.  When used to say  we're from the government, we're here to help, it wasn't really something  people wanted to hear, but I think what you'll hear from the CEOs today is  they're coming committed to this partnership, committed -- and that's the  full -- it's not just for smiles, it's not just when the attack happens but  it's on the planning, the risk assessment, the prioritization, really  understand that interdependent fabric between all the sectors.</p><p> BOLTON:  OK.  We know, for example, at the border, Microsoft specifically  saying we don't want our facial recognition technology used there.  What is  your opinion on that?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I will see to Microsoft their thoughts on that, but sometimes the  biometric technology is actually fastest way to confirm an identity.  So,  we use facial recognition in limited ways right now within the air domain,  within aviation, and we find that vastly increases the ability of  (INAUDIBLE) of passengers.  So, if it's something we can do faster to make  it more efficient while still keeping it secured, at DHS, we'll always look  for opportunities.</p><p> BOLTON:  Secretary Nielsen, before we let you go, how do you see this idea  of a border wall fitting in with immigration policy and how that fits with  security and cybersecurity?</p><p> NIELSEN:  So, all of this together, we're sort of talking about different  walls, aren't we?  So, on the border, walls work.  We've seen that in  (INAUDIBLE) we've seen that in San Diego, we've seen that in other  countries.  When the wall goes out, it does absolutely serve as not just a  deterrent but a physical barrier that makes it much more difficult to  access.  The same can be true of cyber, so what we're looking at is a  system of systems of approach, some are firewalls, but much more than that,  it's monitoring on the systems, looking at the network traffic, identifying  the threat indicator sharing, mitigation measures.  So, similar to  immigration, you have to have -- you have to have many, many layers of  security in order to assure ourselves we're protecting Americans.</p><p> BOLTON:  Do you think we're going to see a shutdown based on this issue?</p><p> NIELSEN:  I think the president has been clear as to what he believes is  needed for border security, but from my perspective, we'll continue to work  with the appropriators and work with Congress so I can make sure that the  men and women of DHS have what they need to do their jobs.</p><p> BOLTON:  All right.  Secretary Nielsen, thank you for the time.  We  appreciate it.  Enjoy the summit.</p><p> NIELSEN:  Thank you.  We will.  Great.</p><p> BOLTON:  Dagen, back to you and studio.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that interview and thanks to the  Secretary as well.  Coming up, a new warning from Morgan Stanley, why the  firm is predicting a correction.  And after Facebook and Netflix, they're  now in the bear market territory, down 20 percent as of yesterday.  And  Leslie Jones is speaking out about comedians being politically correct.   Stuart Varney is here to weigh in, and I can't wait, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LESLIE JONES, COMEDIAN:  Stop walking around, so offended.  You're not  going to be able to survive life if you walk around offended.  Laugh!   Laugh!  Laugh!</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Comedians underfire.  That was \"Saturday Night Live!\" star  Leslie Jones.  She's amazing, love her.  Telling the ladies of \"The View\"  that everyone needs to just get a life, to paraphrase.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Hey, Stuart.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, look, I'm glad we  decided to highlight this because, you know, it's a part of life, isn't it?   You watch those late night comedians, they're awful, they don't make me  laugh, they are not funny.  I've just had a nice three-day weekend and I  took a little time to see some of these late night guys, useless!  I mean,  they're so negative, so hostile, it's all so political, so divisive, I  really welcome Leslie Jones' statement there, and she made it on of all  places, \"The View.\"  </p><p> She's saying, look, \"You can't go through life if you are offended by  everything, you got to laugh.\"  I think her message is, especially those  young people who watch the late night guys, you can't go through life like  this, you can't start out being opposed to everything and being sensitive  to the slightest slight, you can't do that.  I think her message is very  important, and I hope it's picked up by other comedians who make it -- who  bring back comedy, where you're watching their act and you laugh at it, you  laugh with them, you laugh at them, you laugh at the jokes, you smile.  If  we could get back to that, I'd be delighted, not that I will be watching  late night television any time soon again, but it would make a nice change  to our life, wouldn't it? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Stuart, I will turn this back on itself, because part of  what she is saying is there are a lot of people who when those late night  comedians -- I agree, I haven't heard once anything funny in a long time  from them, but Trump supporters who listen to them, when they try to make a  joke about the President, or about Republicans, anything that anyone says,  that's meant to be a joke is offensive.  And so, in part, that's what  Leslie Jones is referring to.</p><p> VARNEY:  I agree.  Yes, that's what -- that's what she's also saying,  lighten up.  Come on, lighten up.  The job of a comedian is to make me  smile, it's to make me laugh, and that whole profession of comedians has  forgotten that message, and I think Leslie Jones is absolute right to bring  it back again.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, and she's also saying that people who go to these comedy  shows, who watch all of these -- the myriad Netflix specials by comediennes  and that a lot -- it's not just the comedians, it's the people watching  them.  They literally come to the table with a list of things that will  offend them, down to do not make fun of people who love cats.  I love cats,  I'm offended by you making fun of cat lovers.  It's that granular, and  that's why people are walking around, as my mother says, with a mad on all  of the time.</p><p> VARNEY:  Right.  Didn't have you have Jimmy Kimmel with Kim Kardashian,  trying to make her go after Mr. Trump or be snide in some ways towards him.   Well, that's just typical, isn't it?  Well, what are they thinking of?  I  mean, is that funny?  Is that what you want to do with your late night  spot?  I can't believe it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've made fun of Kim Kardashian a lot or criticized that family  a lot, however, I will say this, she held her ground with him.  She said,  I'm not going to say anything negative.  And you know what, she deserves a  lot of credit for that.</p><p> VARNEY:  Look, I think she deserves a lot of credit for making an enormous  amount of money without being really good at anything other than being  famous.  And that, to me, is remarkable feat.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- we'd take that job, too, I think, if we could get  it, just being -- making -- being rich for just being yourself.  I think  that we'll take that if we can do it, but we have to have other skills.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, it wouldn't work with me, I'm afraid.  It just wouldn't work.   There you go.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, nobody understands what I'm saying.  I'm out of time  anyways, so good luck with that.  Stuart, I love you dearly.</p><p> VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Great to see you.</p><p> VARNEY:  See you later.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He will be up in less than 10 minutes, every weekday 9:00 a.m.  to noon, Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Coming up, Morgan Stanley is  warning a correction is looming after earnings misses from Facebook and  Netflix.  We are breaking down the details, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investors losing their taste for some key technology stocks,  Facebook and Netflix both yesterday, closing in bear market territory, down  more than 20 percent from their recent record highs, hit earlier this  month.  This comes as analysts at Morgan Stanley believe a major sell-off  is on the way for the broader markets.  Joining us now, S&amp;P Global Market  Intelligence portfolio manager Erin Gibbs.  What do you make of this, is it  going to be these tech stocks that lead the broader market lower?</p><p> ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  I think  it's an overstatement to say that just a couple stocks that have been  missing, and yes, they have missed at extreme levels are going to draw all  of the entire market down.  When you look at the broader S&amp;P 500, we're  actually trading at really regional valuations.  We're looking at 22  percent growth, and when you look at the beat rates for just for a second  quarter and guidance, where the stocks are beating at about an 82 percent  rate, that's really high, that's like 10 percent higher than normal.  So,  the broader market actually looks pretty healthy and while technology has a  huge impact on it, I don't see it being able to take the entire market  down.  And the market is only up four percent year-to-date.  I don't see  that suddenly making, like, us wiping out all of the gains that we've  achieved this year.</p><p> TIMPF:  Well, I think that this report by Morgan Stanley is it's looking at  lagging indicators, it's looking at GDP, it's looking at earnings, so those  are lagging indicators.  If you look at leading indicators like the stock  market and manufacturing data, that's all been really strong.  Where do you  when you think about investing for the second half of the year, where are  you putting your money?</p><p> GIBBS:  So for us, we've been talking about the difference between the  value and growth stocks for a few weeks now, and when you look at the  return of growth stocks, they're up about 10 percent year-to-date and  values only up about two percent.  So, value has been the big laggard and  that's definitely -- if you want safety, that's the place that's not going  down because you just haven't seen this huge uptick, and that could be an  area perhaps later in the year.  I'd say it's a little earlier now, August  tends to be a bad month anyway, it tends to be a rough month, but I would  say in the fall, if -- particularly if we see any preference towards  financials, we really start seeing interest rates, the yield curve go  higher, that could be an area.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Speaking of interest rates, the Federal Reserve meets this week,  not expected to raise interest rates but, again, what will investors be  looking at?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, they're going to be looking at how the Fed  describes how the economy is doing, that really is what changes in their  statement that comes out tomorrow.  I mean, the Fed has going to have to be  positive on the economy.  You know, four percent growth in the second  quarter, inflation that's reaching its target.  You know, I think they're  going to be projecting at least one more interest rate increase and  probably too before the end of the year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And then we got a big old jobs report out on Friday.  So,  190,000 jobs expected right now.  Erin Gibbs, thank you so much, great to  see you.  Next time, more time, promise.  We'll be right back, everybody.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf, Jon Hilsenrath, Lindsey Bell, come back one and all,  thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, it does.  And good morning to you, Dagen.  And good morning,  everyone.  Apple reports today, it's the last of the big tech highflyers to  lay out the financial results.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three,  reporting earnings today.  And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are  out after the closing bell.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the  tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory.  That's down 10  percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves.  The Dow  Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving  higher.  This after declines across the board yesterday with the NASDAQ,  the hardest hit down more than one and one-third percent.</p><p>And despite recent weakness however, all of your market gauges, Dow, S&amp;P,  NASDAQ, even the Dow Transports, and the Russell2000 are on track for  monthly gains as we wrap up the month of July.  </p><p>In Europe, mixed move to report, we have a slight gain on the FT-100 in  England but the French and German markets are heading lower.  A reading on  the euro zone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets a little changed, although we have green to  report except the Hang Seng slipping half of one percent.  The Bank of  Japan surprising investors by keeping policy, monetary policy unchanged.</p><p>Protecting our border, President Trump doubling down on his calls for a  government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one new development, a change in that timeline, the  president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm  elections.  That's from a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus  cyber security later this morning.</p><p>King James takes on the commander-in-chief, LeBron James getting political  slamming the president by saying he's using sports to divide this country.</p><p>Plus, a homeless web developer and his plea for a job goes viral.  Instead  for asking for money, he asked people to take his resume and it resulted in  hundreds of responses.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Contributor Kat  Timpf is here.  Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.   And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Much to talk about with these  technology stocks, the economy.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  We have Apple earnings  -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech  wreck, the correction continues.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  We'll see if Apple can  save the day here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear  from you as well.  I know you love talking stocks.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I love talking stocks.  I'm  like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're an expert on a lot.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That too.  We'll get to that.  And to our top story this hour,  the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp;  Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p>But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple  reports its quarterly results.  Estimates are calling for earnings per  share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.  </p><p>This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and  Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following  Facebook's massive miss last week.  </p><p>Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax.   Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a  Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a  consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite  the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and  Twitter do.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  I think that's  right Dagen.  I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the  performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak  quarter.</p><p>But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services  is performing.  And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products  likely in September.  And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a  differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like  augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy  and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p>BELL:  Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors  what they want to hear about the new iPhones?  Are they all going to be  released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year  where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p>FLAX:  I think it's possible that they all get announced in September.   We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the  devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little  bit later.</p><p>But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs  to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market.   Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if  necessary to get the product right.</p><p>And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this  single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do  over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users  trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p>TIMPF:  How about --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all  these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.  </p><p>Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether  saying, \"All right.  You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you  know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the  social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to  expectations.\"</p><p>Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you  know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p>FLAX:  I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the  growth.  And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're  growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p>Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud  business and advertising is a newer business for them too.  </p><p>In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has  telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's  really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to  navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all  appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming  to the four.</p><p>And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be --  allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their  data.  And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate  a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street  Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC  FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies,  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla,  (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p>But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the  recent high, the recent record on June 20th.  Not the first time it  happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is  the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this  year.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of  think that this move has been overdone.  This is in a sector that's  entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems  within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p>But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet,  these are all really good reports.  Even Netflix, I know it was a miss.   That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its  most recent high this year.</p><p>The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected,  do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as  the overall FANG group?</p><p>FLAX:  Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going  to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and  ultimately grow.  I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has  certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in  content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p>But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the  space as well.  When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point  on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them  and analyze them one-by-one.  I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a  brush across them.</p><p>So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to  like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends  around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth  runway.</p><p>And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's  bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're  trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term  horizon.  And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to  two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market  selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying  opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the --  again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is  extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've  entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are  made in China by Foxconn.</p><p>They can't readily shift production to another country for that.  And we  will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to  this trade fight?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could  punch back at the United States --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- if we increased tariffs.  We -- they sell a lot more to us  than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.  </p><p>So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life  more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China.   Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese  economy receptive to foreign investment.  But the -- one of the ways that  they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Exactly.  How --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- they could increase the spying that they do on their  corporate executives here and really around the world.  They could hold up  goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation.   There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all?  I  mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk  start up again between the U.S. and China.  You know, the U.S. and the  Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the  works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again?  So that's on  hold right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk  about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know,  months today all the market gauges are up.  The Dow Transports are up the  most of any other major market gauges.</p><p>But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the  overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your  age group?</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people  look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this.  I think that people are  concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.  </p><p>I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people  are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters  specifically are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say,  put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p>FLAX:  So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their  way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next  few years.</p><p>What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing,  building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to  grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.  </p><p>And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out  of digital economies.  So you take a company like Apple there are a far  reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that  is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, good to see you.  Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this  morning.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we wait for the Apple results.  Coming up, California  scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating  its own weather system.  Plus, how the military is waging the war on that  blaze.</p><p>CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual  harassment allegations.  The board of directors taking a major action to  get some answers.  More on that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we  still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain  on the Futures.</p><p>But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month  of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green  for the month.  The biggest winner are the Dow Transports.  Dow Transports  are up nearly six percent so far in July.  And if you're a big believer in  old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the  economy.</p><p>Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr  Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has  now burned over 100,000 acres.  Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this  fire right now.  This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's  history.</p><p>Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds  making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to  spread next.  Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p>At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the  wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk  helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating  tragedy out in California.  </p><p>Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to  conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of  sexual misconduct.  The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which  six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.  </p><p>CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday.  Shares of CBS are  down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking  yesterday.</p><p>Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets.  They are  shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt.  G.E. Digital has  continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment.  Company  has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation.   Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p>And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance.  A  homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes  while he was standing next to a highway.  This happened in Silicon Valley  of all places.  </p><p>Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that  read, \"Homeless, hungry for success.  Take a resume.\"  His luck changed  after his job pitch went viral on the internet.  Casares who by the way has  a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of  money.</p><p>Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even  Pandora, Dagen.  So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a  heart.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p>TIMPF:  Oh, I love it.  It's my absolute favorite, yes.  This is so, so, so  nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and,  again, it's --</p><p>TIMPF:  And anyone --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really  sad to see something like that.  But this guy, someone who believes in  himself.  He says, \"I have something to offer.  I can take a job, I can do  this for you.\"  And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can I give you the geek response to this?  I --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  See this has read another example of how tight our labor  market is.  We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies  everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people,  for labor.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill  them.  So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And so a man on a street can get a job.  But, you know, we see  this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting  jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before.   This is a great example of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It really is an incredible economy.  That it is opening  itself to one and all.</p><p>BELL:  Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you  know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted  that were reaching out to him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But some of the people at those companies when it comes to  hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to  college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible  people who didn't go to Ivy League schools.  And that --</p><p>BELL:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that  snootiness at some of these tech companies.  </p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that for a fact.  Coming up, President Trump doubling  down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not  approved.  But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p>And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again.  The details on  Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are working closely with our European partners including Italy  to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.  Now is also the perfect time to  expand commerce between the United States and Italy. </p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates  enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida  later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event  and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p>Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight?  Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they  tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying  what his supporters want to hear?</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that they're definitely a little bit separate.  The economy  is doing very well right now.  But when you talk about trade and tariffs  particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the  economy.</p><p>And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican  president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the  conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of  view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's  really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this  is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and  republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p>But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been  cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property  from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology.  When he's able to  talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together.  And  certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election  was take over blue collar America basically.  You know, he taps in to  people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p>And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally  support for him.  The question is, what does it do for the rest of the  country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through  on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000  instead of $20,000.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting  with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission.  That seems to at  least be on hold.  That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock  market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he  needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p>And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we  might have seen is that pivot taking place next week.  And so what I'm  waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese.  There  hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to  talking or is he going to ratchet things up?  And we just don't know where  he stands there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about China.  China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot  more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion  worth of goods from China every year.  They buy about $130 billion from the  United States.</p><p>China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is  beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods.  Here is  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position  overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Trump Administration is  committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.   We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles  of freedom and openness.</p><p>Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will  continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and  open Indo-Pacific.  President Trump will strike when the iron is hot  because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p>We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long  as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens  demand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p>BELL:  You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing  that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and  especially within the Asian market.  And with China in particular, these  tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to  maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual  property and technology.</p><p>The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to  the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first  thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out  of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  </p><p>So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you  know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of  the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing  what he said on the campaign trail.  He's been focused on if I said it, I'm  going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said.  You know,  he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign  trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong  direction.</p><p>TIMPF:  He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies,  things like that.  But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been  very consistent the entire time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has.  And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about  it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to  prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that.   You're going to have to wait.  I don't know when I'll get to ask them about  it but I will be asking you about that very thing.  </p><p>Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who  have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong  borders and powerful trade.  I never sought their support because I don't  need their money or bad ideas.  They love my tax and regulation cuts,  judicial picks and more.\"</p><p>\"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated.  I have beaten them  at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from  being taxed.  I'm for America First and the American worker.  A puppet for  no one.  Two nice guys with bad ideas.  Make America great again.\"</p><p>TIMPF:  Typical Trump tweet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  And he basically covered everything we were just  talking about.</p><p>Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his  back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the  agency.</p><p>And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump.  The NBA star says  the President of the United States is a divider when it comes to the NFL  protests.  The new comments, ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both  reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after  the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the  likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those  companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p>Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point  gain on the Dow Futures.  We have green across the board.  And as we move  into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday.  The NASDAQ lost more  than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.  </p><p>And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and  the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p>European markets are mixed this morning.  Right now, it's green across the  board.  We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany.  And in  Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan,  Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser,  the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again  on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all  sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful.  We are doing a  phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work.   So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President threatening government shutdown over border  security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will  happen after the midterm elections now.  We'll hear from Homeland Security  Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this  morning.</p><p>LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star  saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his  inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p>Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service  says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases  and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p>Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his  threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for  border security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.  As  you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're  going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law  enforcement very high.  But I would be certainly willing to consider a  shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  However, one administration official says that the President has  agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm  elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the  Wall Street Journal today.  Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the  Federalist.  Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for  Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes, I think that this speaks to  a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is.  I mean,  this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20  years.  </p><p>And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing  resolution is when there is a shutdown looming.  So, I think, rhetorically,  it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only  time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually  doing things.</p><p>I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official  out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind  of, soften this eventually.  This is what we have seen, kind of, time and  time again.  I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall  that Mexico was going to pay for.  And it was going to be just this entire  wall of concrete.  </p><p>And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain  sections along the border and, right.  So I think that there is the tough  line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization  and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or  just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's  already said he's going to do it.  What do you think is the point of  waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want  to delay that.  I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out  and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to  make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout  this whole time.  </p><p>And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not  -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that  this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go  through.</p><p>So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue,  and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered  on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for  the wall funding.  There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus  spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for,  essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall.  And there were  no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there  to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that  omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the  Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid  that until after November?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think what's going on here is the President has lost his  patience.  And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade  fight, you know.  In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers,  including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.  </p><p>And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to --  we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did.   And that's been the story of 2018.  I think he lost his patience on this  question of border security and the border wall.  </p><p>But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan  and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election  because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are  trying to hold to the House.</p><p>So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're  just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in  the process.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as  the Democrats.  Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell  in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative  win, and that's those tax cuts.  </p><p>And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four  percent right now.  That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so  incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are  unemployed at this point.  So, again, if you want to side -- you want to  run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  And I think the economy, even though it was  politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a  bigger priority and a bigger win.  I'm putting that in quotes than the  border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p>So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get  done before this border wall funding was able to get done.  And I think  this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party,  which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are  going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p>They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's  going to vote as a block.  And they don't use carrots and sticks.  They  don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they  want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within  leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in  order to get things done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of  Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters,  ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees.  Do  cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in  terms of messaging?</p><p>PAYTON:  Oh, I think, absolutely.  I mean, listen, if you're upset about  the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies,  there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it  and raise media attention.  </p><p>I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming  over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating  individuals coming over together.  And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p>So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled  veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer  camp.  That's not the way to do that.  And, I think, Portland mayor  reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these  protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p>I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the  Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a  border.  They don't like the fact that there are laws.  I think it's  demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I  should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I would just encourage all of these elected officials  to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and  breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking.  As if that that's not  a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many  women putting their lives at risk for that.  </p><p>Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p>PAYTON:  Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre Payton.  Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron  DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is  heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and  also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in  the show.</p><p>But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star  is saying the President is using sports to divide this country.  Plus --  and movie pass, not getting a pass from fans after the company pulls major  movies like Mission Impossible Fallout, from its program, the internet  backlash, instant and brutal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good news for Credit Suisse and its shareholders.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Dagen, that is right.  Credit Suisse now on track to report its  first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than  doubled from last year.  This, of course, is beating the street's forecast.   The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions  along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest  of the year.  Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the  premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.  </p><p>Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its  vehicles.  The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door  cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year.  The system lets drivers  know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even  kids.  Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.  </p><p>Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto.  Remember,  when they debuted this?  Made such a big deal about it.  Well, they now  want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead.  Uber acquired Anthony  Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they  later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's  Waymo, that he stole trade secrets.  That resulted in a lawsuit against  Uber that was settled back in February.  The move does not affect Uber  freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.  </p><p>And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated.  The  CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including  \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app.  The all  you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its  parent company ran out of cash, literally.  Take a look at some of the  tweets.  A lot of good reaction.  This one says, a live look at the  MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office.  Here's a tweet with  the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes.  Shares  of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year.  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Lebron James accuses the  president of the United States of dividing the nation.  The NBA star's  blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in  less than two years.  Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Dagen, good morning.  Some good  news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential  benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players.  News  broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry,  announces retirement having suffered six concussions.  Report release that  shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts.   While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments,  now the NFL has distributed over $502 million.  It had been projected the  league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went  into effect January 2017.  521 players have been paid.  Now, projected the  league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.  </p><p>Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all  eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment.   They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available  for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition.  The  settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their  families.  </p><p>While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between  sports and politics.  While President Trump has been outspoken about his  strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his  involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry  Jones, called his involvement problematic.  And last night, Lebron James  said this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS:  He's kind of using sport to,  kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know  that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white.  Sports has  never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings  someone together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider  that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew  they go to championship.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers,  John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said:  \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\"   President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for  divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people  in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.  </p><p>MAX:  This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you  think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he  handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in  this conversation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that this issue is just so  polarizing.  There's two sides.  Each of them feels very strong emotions  about their particular side.  There's really no solution to this that's  going to make everybody happy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me  that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this  country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to  Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down  and never gets anywhere.  So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on  this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being  kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally  dug in.  </p><p>HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had  acted strongly and it never would've come to this?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I think he was scared.  Everyone going through this for the  first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this.  What I think -- he  became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable  to do this.  What could he have done?  I've said this on the air, I think,  for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would  certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is  terrible.  It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and  the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car  knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble.  And that's where I  think Roger Goodell is.  Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt  with this.  He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you  stand for the anthem.  Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done  that properly. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and  the like, some of them keep talking about it.  </p><p>MAX:  Not easy situation to deal with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Jared Max.  His sports reports, Fox News  Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, that million-dollar (INAUDIBLE)  you've got, may not be enough to retire on.

Three Dow components reporting  today -- Pfizer up first, the pharmaceutical giant posting better than  expected results.

DESANTIS:  Big league -- so good.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  I just thought you should know.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Ron DeSantis for governor.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, the Florida congressman himself -- Ron DeSantis,  a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.   Congressman -- that has sent people who dislike President Trump, I don't  care what party affiliation they have, into a frenzy.  They are losing  their minds about that.</p><p>But do you risk anything really going full-in on President Trump, although  his endorsement of you has been a great benefit to you and your campaign  and the polls and even in fund raising?  </p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FL.:  Well, Dagen, I mean -- you know, in some of  these things with the political back and forth, you've got to be able to  take a step back and just kind of laugh at the situation, have a little fun  with it.  So that's what we were trying to do.</p><p>It is a way to introduce voters to my wife, who is my best friend and best  supporter and our kids, because that's an important part of who I am.   Obviously we've run ads previous to this, talking about my military  service, talking about my conservative credentials.</p><p>But when you have nonstop ads in a primary season, you know, I think it's  good to just kind of take a step back, be able to laugh at yourself a  little bit and have a little fun with it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- the joke has always been that politicians go on  the campaign trail and hold babies.  But you're using a baby, your son, in  that ad to maybe make people feel good.  No?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, look, everyone has said, you know, wow, your wife's  beautiful, your kids are so cute and everything and they are.  I mean I'm  very, very proud of my family.  We love to get them on the campaign trail  as much as possible.</p><p>It's not the easiest thing in the world when your daughter is 20 months  because she's very active.  My son is pretty much go with the flow so  that's a little bit easier.  But just a really, really central part of my  life and I wanted to let voters get an introduction to them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- do you disagree with President Trump on any  policy ideas?  Can you name one?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  I don't agree with anybody on everything 100 percent of the  time.  What I've typically done though with the President is talk to him  privately rather than go kowtow -- I mean the easiest way to get a  microphone in your face in Washington is to bash the President if you're a  Republican for CNN and NBC and \"New York Times\".  I don't think that's  constructive.</p><p>But there are obviously things that I have disagreed.  But you do it  constructively and you try to -- you try to move the ball forward as best  you can.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you care to mention any of those things you've had  constructive conversations with?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well Dagen -- one of them that we would probably agree with is,  you know, I'm not a fan of farm subsidies.  And you know, to throw billions  of dollars in farm subsidies, I want to get away from doing that, you know.   So there's just an honest disagreement.</p><p>There are people in the Republican conference who we disagree with on those  things.  So it's fine.  But you agree with most of what's going on.  You  just try to press forward as best you can.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that $12 billion in farm subsidies is to offset any hit  that, say, farmers, soybean farmers and the like would face because of the  retaliatory tariffs from China as we've gotten into this tariff fight --  trade fight with China.  Also the steel and aluminum tariff play into some  of the retaliation from allies like Canada.</p><p>But do you agree with that approach?  Trade is expected to play a big role  in the GOP primary.  China threatened additional retaliatory tariffs  against an array of agricultural products that would impact your state.</p><p>So if you're against farm subsidies, are you against what the President has  done in terms of tariffs and the fight that we're beginning to wage with  some trading partners?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, I tell you, I MEAN I think I've been surprised at some of  the success HE'S gotten.  I've typically not been somebody that has  supported tariffs.  And I don't think that's the end state that you want.</p><p>But I think he's leveraged that like he did with the European Union to get  concessions.  And so if that's what he's able to do, then that's probably  going to benefit a lot of folks.</p><p>If the concessions aren't there, then I think you're going to be in a  situation where you're going to have to change course.  But using it to  negotiate, it was not something that a lot of us had thought about  previously.  He really believes in doing it and I think that he's been able  to get some concessions.  So I think we'll see how it goes going forward.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because I was going to mention that Adam Putnam is the  agriculture secretary in the state, so this will be an issue in terms of  any impact on the agriculture sector in Florida.  And critically important,  it's one of the biggest pieces of the Florida economy.</p><p>Are people calling your office as a congressman from the state and  complaining about the fallout on them, whether they're farmers or not,  about the trade fight that's just beginning this year?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Not really.  I mean I think that there's some folks who are very  supportive of doing it politically because they think this has gone on too  long.  There's other folks who are concerned but want to give the President  some runway.  So, you know, we'll see how things develop.   </p><p>But I would say, Dagen -- ag has been a big part of Florida's economy,  obviously tourism.  I think the thing for the next governor is, you know,  how do you expand the economic base?  I think we're primed to do very well  in financial services.  Why would you start a hedge fund right now in  Connecticut or New York given that the SALT deduction is gone?  We don't  have income tax in Florida.  We have a very good regulatory climate,  positive.  We've got to do some other things.</p><p>But I think you're going to see Florida with the right policies, really  expand economic opportunities in a variety of industries and that's  exciting.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- a brewing border battle, President Trump doubling  down yesterday on his threat of a government shutdown for lack of border  wall funding, saying he would, quote, \"certainly be willing to close down  the government.\"</p><p>One administration official now says -- tells the \"Wall Street Journal\" the  President has agreed to delay that fight over border security until after  November's midterm elections.  Congressman -- how critical is border  protection and building that wall for Republican voters this fall?  And  would you stand by a shutdown if it happens before the midterms?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, I think one of the disappointments in the Congress,  frankly, is we still to this day have not done much to push for the border  wall.  We did have the Goodlatte bill that got 193 votes in the House.   This is one of the President's central promises.  We should have moved this  in January of 2017.</p><p>So now at this stage, whether that's the right inflection point to do it, I  don't know.  But I will tell you this.  It will probably be harder to get  all our voters out to the polls in November as a result of the Congress not  following through.</p><p>You know, many of us wanted to follow through with it but we actually never  got that across the finish line and I think that there's been a lot of good  things done but I think that is definitely something that could bite some  of our members in the behind.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You mean if the border wall is not funded?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes, or to not each have fights over it.  I mean, you know, it's  one thing if we're really pushing for it, we're passing it in the House,  it's in the senate, they're debating on it, voting on it.  And then you  have a couple of these Democrat senators in Trump states.  If they're  voting to filibuster it, then you take that issue to the voters.  You can  try to make a change.</p><p>But you know, we haven't even been willing to have the fight yet and I  think that that frustrates a lot of folks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But would you get behind a shutdown if it meant shutting down  the government in order to get that border funding, that wall funding?  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Well, what the House would do is -- I mean we would either fund  it or not.  I mean we would not be the ones that would, quote, \"shut down\"  government.  We would pass a funding bill presumably that has funding for  the wall and I would support the funding.  And then it would go to the  senate and the question would be I think the President would say make sure  this is in there, otherwise I'm not going to sign it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>DESANTIS:  I think it will be -- it will fall to those Democratic senators  and see how they react.  And you've got to be nimble on these things.  I  mean you've got to have political sense to it.  So we would have to see how  it goes up.</p><p>But I think we should definitely put that in whatever funding mechanism we  send over to the senate.  But I can tell you if we do another omnibus bill  that's put together at the last minute and packed with spending; and  there's no border security that is going to be a bad thing for a Republican  Congress to do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And President Trump after you signed the last one did reiterate  that he would not sign another one unless it funded the border wall.</p><p>Thank you -- Congressman.  Congressman Ron DeSantis.  We'll be watching  this evening as President Trump heads to Tampa.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Chipotle taking another hit.  Shares of the burrito  chain sinking after one of its restaurants was shut down over reports of  customers getting sick.  Details on that.  Plus Chipotle's big giveaway  today.</p><p>Money in the bank -- why millennials' preference for cash over stocks could  be costing them big time.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The earnings parade continues as investors look over results  from Pfizer and some other big names.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Dagen.</p><p>Pfizer's latest results came in better than expected as the company raises  its profit outlook for the entire year.  but Pfizer also cut the revenue  outlook due to the stronger dollar.  Pfizer shares are under pressure now  in the pre-market, down a little more than three-quarters of a percent  right now.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble just out with better than expected earnings per share but  revenue came in just short of expectations.  Shares of P&amp;G are lower ahead  of the opening bell, down almost 2 percent.</p><p>We are also watching this morning the FANG stocks -- Facebook, Apple --  Apple of course getting earnings after the bell -- Amazon, Netflix and  Google's parent Alphabet.  The Nasdaq composite closed down nearly 1.5  percent yesterday on growth concerns about the technology sector in  general.</p><p>That's as one closely watched index of the FANG stocks slid into correction  territory -- excuse me -- yesterday, the NYSE FANG Index.  So we're  watching a lot of these names in particular today.</p><p>Also watching this for you -- more trouble at Chipotle.  The chain has shut  down a restaurant in Ohio following reports of as many as 12 customers  getting sick after they ate there.  Some customers detailed their illness  on the food safety Web site, iwaspoisoned.com.  Chipotle says that it is  working now with local health officials to reopen the store as soon as  possible.</p><p>Well, a number of food safety issues since 2015, you may remember have hurt  the restaurant's stock and obviously its reputation.  Anyway shares of  Chipotle dropped about 1.5 percent yesterday.  We should, of course, be  watching the stock today.</p><p>Also today, lighter note, it's free guacamole day at Chipotle, just in case  you're wondering.  They're celebrating national avocado day.  They're not  going to be charging extra for their very popular guacamole, especially  when you order it online with an entree.  You have to type in the seven- digit code \"avocado\" -- pretty simple.</p><p>All right.  A woman wants to take Canada Dry to court over ginger ale.  She  filed a lawsuit against Canada Dry and its parent company Dr. Pepper  Snapple Group claiming that Canada dry lies to its customers with the name  ginger ale because it doesn't actually have any ginger in it.</p><p>The woman says this is false advertising because Canada Dry promises  consumers the health benefits of ginger.  Similar lawsuits have previously  been filed in Missouri, Massachusetts, California and Texas.  Bring on the  lawyers -- Dagen.</p><p>Those are your headlines.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Kat Timpf is over here making a face.  She's making the same face -- again,  this society, the people -- what they sue over, it makes me crazy.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Imagine taking time out of your life to sue a pop company, period.   Just imagine over ginger ale that doesn't have ginger in it -- yes, I'm  from Michigan.  Ginger ale doesn't have ginger it.  Don't they have like  friends and -- or even, you know, a show they like on Netflix to watch?   Don't they have things to do?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Kat Timpf.  That's why I went to you.</p><p>Coming up, crossing party lines, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin becoming  the first in his party to sit down with Supreme Court nominee Brett  Kavanaugh.  Why other Democrats could soon follow.</p><p>And a touching moment amid the destruction.  One little girl handing out  burritos to firefighters battling the Carr Fire in California.  We've got  more of this heart-warming video for you, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Paul Manafort heading to court -- jury selection beginning today  for President Trump's former campaign chairman.  If convicted, he could  face decades in prison on bank and tax fraud charges.  This is the first  case arising from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.</p><p>Joining us now, former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy.  Andy -- could  this -- how will this even trial have an impact on the course of Mueller's  investigation?  </p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  You know, it really won't have  any.  The more you think about it, the less I think it will.  The thought  up until now has been -- and it's probably still true -- that Mueller is  trying to squeeze Manafort to see if he's got anything on Trump in  connection with collusion.</p><p>But if you think about it, Mueller has had Richard Gates as a witness for  months.  Gates was Manafort's partner through all of the shenanigans that  he's on trial for, right.  You have to -- and plus, Gates came into Trump's  campaign with Manafort.  So it would be hard to believe that there's  something that Manafort has about the campaign and any connection with  Russia that Gates doesn't already have and was not already in a position to  give to Mueller.</p><p>So, you know, I think they went down this road with Manafort.  All of the  interesting thing is, this may be a test of Mueller's prosecution but it's  not really a test of his investigation.  The rational for the investigation  is any interference by Russia in the election and any connection that the  Trump campaign may have had in that.  This trial has nothing to do with  that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this is the first of two trials.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's another trial that's going to happen in the District of  Columbia.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Right.  And that one doesn't have anything to do with the  rational for the investigation either.  The reason there's two trials is  Manafort objected to being tried for everything including some tax charges  that he's entitled to have in a particular venue.  Most people would want  to have one trial where it all gets hammered out there.  He decided to push  for two.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're Rudy Giuliani though would you wait until after all  this is done to make a decision about allowing the President to potentially  sit down for an interview though.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  No.  If I was Rudy, I wouldn't let the President sit down for an  interview.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you for that very short answer -- Andy.</p><p>Switching gears to breaking party lines -- Democratic Senator Joe Manchin  meeting with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh yesterday, becoming the  first in his party to sit down with President Trump's pick for the high  court after the two met on Capitol Hill.  The West Virginia senator  described the meeting as productive.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence explained why the President chose Kavanaugh  during that exclusive interview with Maria Bartiromo last week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The President of the  United States, in this deliberation, he was looking for a judge with  extraordinary credentials and intellect.  But also a judge who would  strictly interpret the constitution as written and not legislate from the  bench.</p><p>Judge Brett Kavanaugh has that judicial philosophy.  He has a proven  record.  That's what the President made this nomination about.  That's the  message we'll carry to Republicans and Democrats in the Senate.  </p><p>And we remain confident that before the fall is out, that Judge Brett  Kavanaugh will be Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator Joe Manchin, Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly were the  three Democrats who voted for Neil Gorsuch.  Do you expect all of these  three to get onboard or even more, we heard from Rand Paul yesterday, he's  a yea vote on Brett Kavanaugh to be on the court.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes, I do.  I think that in fact, the dynamic going on inside  the Democratic Party now may actually draw more moderate Democrats toward  Kavanaugh because there's I think in the places where they're running,  which are states that Trump won, some places like Indiana where he won by a  lot -- there's a lot of pressure on those Democrats to distinguish  themselves from the sort of flavor of the month that we have of the hard  progressive left, particularly the woman who won in New York.  And I think  that's going to push those people to show that they're more reasonable and  ready to work with the other side.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's 10 Democratic senators up for re-election in Trump  states come November.  And again, if you vote against Brett Kavanaugh, you  do appear as if you're taking orders from Chuck Schumer.  </p><p>MCCARTHY:  Yes.  Well, the problem they have is Kavanaugh is an excellent  judge.  If it wasn't for the infusion of politics in this, if it was just  his craftsmanship, his ability as a lawyer and his reputation in his life,  this would be a no-brainer.  It should be 100-0 confirmation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Andrew McCarthy -- great to see you.  Andy -- be well.  Come  back soon.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're around now so we see you all the time.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  I am around.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love it.</p><p>Coming up to the Rocketman nickname, North Korea is said to be pressing  ahead with building new missiles, according to U.S. spy agencies.

But it might surprise you where they're investing their money,  is it smart?  We debate.  </p><p>Now on to our top story this half an hour.  Not following through, new  satellite images reveal North Korea is expanding and continuing production  at a missile facility, increasing fears that the rogue regime has no plans  to pursue denuclearization.  </p><p>Joining us now, former CIA trained intelligence operative, former navy  pilot, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea, your response to this --  your take on this report?  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I don't think that it  necessarily indicates that North Korea will not work with us on  denuclearizing.  I think that the bottom line is that, you know, the summit  that occurred between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, they laid out sort  of a ground work agreement.  They said we will work towards  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>But you can't expect a country that believes that its lifeblood, that  believes that nuclear weapons, what it's expected to be able to protect it  as a nation, that they would just give up those nuclear weapons and they  would just stop progress in developing nuclear weapons off of one summit  and one sort of loose agreement.  I think that the president in conducting  that summit, his intention was let's start talking, let's start a  conversation.  </p><p>Secretary Pompeo has testified on the Hill that we are aware that the North  is continuing to work towards developing its nuclear weapons technology but  our diplomats are continuing to have conversations with North Korea to come  up with a longer term agreement.  </p><p>So, I think that's what our focus should be right now is what progress can  be made and also I think we just don't know what Kim Jong-un is thinking.   Does he want to be brought into the fold of western countries?  Does he  want to become a more modern country?  Or does he want to remain in  isolation?  And we just don't know the answer to that yet, Dagen.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Do you think that was a mistake  that it was a loose agreement, that there weren't specific details within  the agreement at that were made at the summit?  Do you think we took a step  back?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think it would have been great if we could have 100 percent  gotten North Korea to agree to give up their entire nuclear weapons program  that they've been developing for so many years, that would have been  awesome of President Trump.  </p><p>But that's not what the president does.  The president is an executive.  He  comes up with loose agreements.  He brings countries together and has these  conversations and then he brings in the people who work for him who are  experts in the field to work out the details.  That's how these agreements  are done.  </p><p>So I don't think it was a mistake.  I think he started the conversation and  the question is whether or not North Korea is genuine in wanting to work  with us and wanting to work with South Korea and wanting to become into the  fold of -- you know, other nations.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Lea, we gave up something in that negotiation.  We gave up --</p><p>GARBRIEL:  We did.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- this joint military exercises.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You know, with the North Koreans continuing to build, does  that tell you maybe we gave up too much?  Because they really haven't moved  besides giving back these remains.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  So, first let me correct you.  Because we didn't actually give  up our exercises.  We decided to halt them, right.  We can always turn  those exercises back on.  We've been doing them for a very long time with  South Korea.  And we work really well with South Korea.  So, we didn't give  them up.  You were going to say something.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, and he mentioned the return of the remains of those killed  during the Korean War. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is very significant, particularly the families and anybody  who has ever served this country.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Absolutely it is.  And of course, those remains -- you know,  I'm skeptical of them.  In the past and North Korea has been accused of  throwing animal bones in those boxes.  And so, those remains will be  tested, hopefully they'll be identified.  But that is a very strong act of  goodwill and it's just the beginning.  </p><p>I mean, there are so many remains that are there in North Korea that  families will want to get in there and have people be part of recovering.   But that's a good point, that that was part of what's happened since the  summit.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Just to press on this point about giving up the exercises, we  can -- we can renew them any time.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But does it affect our preparedness if we're not doing them  now.  If you go a certain period of time without doing them, are you ready  for some kind of military confrontation?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And that's a great point.  Of course it affects your  preparedness.  You know, we saw how military preparedness was affected with  sequestration and how it does damage our military and our ability to  respond immediately to threats if we're not doing exercises.  </p><p>That being said, we can turn those back in a heartbeat and President Trump  knew that when he decided to halt them.  But they've been a big aggravating  factor for Kim Jong-un.  He believes that they are -- that they are  exercises to invade North Korea, which they are not.  But it was basically  to stop the aggravation, hey, let's come together, let's see what we can  work out here.  </p><p>And now, it's down to the -- you know, the smaller conversations that are - - that were -- are not as going to be public among our diplomats and there  is -- when you look at what's being done this particular facility  (INAUDIBLE), you know, this is the facility where the longest range  intercontinental ballistic missiles were developed, the ones that are  believed to be able to strike the U.S.  Although, we know, as far as our  technology is concerned, we don't believe that they have re-entry vehicles  at this point that can bring that punch to the U.S. yet.  </p><p>So, there is of course concern about what we're seeing in these new images.   But I don't think this is a surprise to our intelligence community.  It's  certainly not a surprise to Secretary Pompeo.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But there are a number of stories that have come out.  There was  one that there was -- there were images reportedly showing that North Korea  was dismantling a key test site.  There was earlier report right after the  summit that President Trump had that North Korea was continuing to enrich  uranium.  So, there's a lot that's playing out in the press.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But we don't really know any much about the discussions that  have gone on so far.  And one of the critical things that General Jack  Keane said on this program last week, that a key denominator must be that  North Korea hand over the location and identity -- ad identify all the  nuclear and ballistic missile test sites.  </p><p>And quite frankly in the past, North Korea has wanted sanctions relief,  they want the carrots and then delay -- they want the carrots up front.   And so, if they're coming to us and wanting any kind of sanctions relief,  then we should -- we should demand the location of all of these test sites  and quite frankly, maybe a time frame.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And this is exactly why these types of negotiations are so  difficult and can't be done on a single summit.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I mean, it takes time to work through those issues.  North  Korea, as I said before, believes that North -- that its nuclear weapons  technology is its lifeblood, believes that it needs that to protect itself  as a country.  </p><p>So, we can't expect North Korea to just all of a sudden bend and fold.   This is going to be a negotiations process.  </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Do you think that President Trump is a  little bit too optimistic when it comes to this?  Because it is going to be  a long process.  And they have in the past promised things and they've not  followed through on those things.  That would not be a big surprise.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's a great point, I think the question is, is President  Trump really that optimistic or is it what his public statements are versus  what he's actually really thinking.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Right. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think what he's trying to do is show goodwill towards North  Korea and I think he's making public statements that do that.</p><p>In my experience with diplomacy, there's public diplomacy and then there's  private diplomacy.  There's what you say, you know, behind the scenes.  And  then there's what you say publicly to encourage the country to work with  you.  </p><p>And then the question is, is North Korea genuine?  We don't know the answer  to that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will point out that he did tweet after that summit, and again,  we talk about Twitter, it's his form of communication, there's no longer a  nuclear threat from North Korea.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, I think people knew that that was, well, President Trump  just being President Trump.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to read you this and get your reaction to it.  The head  of Iran's strategic council on Foreign Relations says that Tehran sees no  value in Trump's offer for negotiations.  This is actually the front page  story in the Wall Street Journal today that President Trump is opening --  open to meeting -0 and meeting the leaders of Iran.  I wanted to get your  reaction to that.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think the reaction -- my reaction to that is just that Iran  is essentially trying to go toe to toe and use the same type of tactic that  President Trump uses with countries against President Trump, taking this  hard line approach.  But in the past we've seen this rhetoric fly.  We've  seen a lot of saber-rattling and then sometimes we see these offers to have  a conversation work.  So, it's yet to be determined.  </p><p>But Iran has really been trying to spread its wings, it's been -- it's been  spreading its influence in the region.  Iran has not been showing a desire  to work with the U.S. and to sort of settle back on some of its regional --  its regional activities.  When you look at places like Syria, you look at  places like Iraq, Iran has been a really big problem.  So, it doesn't  surprise me that they're reacting this way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, we know one thing, that money talks and, well, chitchat  walks.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we're getting ready to reimpose sanctions on Iran, it's  starting in August.  And we have essentially threatened to also put the  hammer down on Europe, any European nations and countries -- and companies  that do business with Iran.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And of course, Russia is one of the ones we have to be  concerned with.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  In working with Iran.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but President Trump did reiterate that there will be no  sanctions relief on Russia, and potentially more sanctions coming on  Russia.  So again, it's all about the moolah.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  It is about the money, when you put pressure on the country  economically, that's where we've seen them bend in the past and fold.  So,  it's to be determined how this is going to play out at this point.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea Gabrielle, thank you Lea.  Great to see you.  You coveres a  lot of ground for us.</p><p>Coming up, waging war on a wildfire, the Carr Fire in Northern California  now burning so hot it's created its own weather system.  We take you live  to Redding, California, for an update.  </p><p>Plus, a touching moment amid the devastation, one little girl handing out  burritos to firefighters battling that devastating blaze.  We've got more  of this heart-warming video for you, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The deadly California wildfires still burning out of control,  that fire so powerful it's creating its own weather system, making  containment all the more difficult for more than 12,000 firefighters.  </p><p>Our own Hillary Vaughn live in Redding, California to give us an update on  the very latest.  Good morning, Hillary.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   Over a dozen wildfires burning throughout the state.  The Carr Fire that  tore through this Redding neighborhood has already killed six people, it's  displaced thousands and it's leveled entire communities.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's pointing to the ashes, saying fire, so she  knows, they know what's going on, they just don't know how severe it is and  we're doing everything to keep them in that state of mind where they're  happy and we're freaking out.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I lost it all, every bit of it, I'm sorry.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's OK -- it's OK.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's been a hell of a month for our firefighters.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  This fire has morphed into one of California's most destructive  and deadly already in the top 10, the most damaging fires the state has  ever seen.  16 states around the country have donated resources to help  fight these fires in California.  </p><p>But even with the extra hands, firefighters are dealing with one of the  most erratic fires that they have ever confronted, giving birth to a new  phenomenon that even has some meteorologists curious.  (INAUDIBLE) a giant  fire cloud ominously looming over a community that is struggling to stay  standing, the giant cloud can trigger its own internal thunderstorm,  creating its own weather, making it very unpredictable.  </p><p>And also, here in Redding, a tornado of fire, some are calling it a fire- nado, charging towards this town in a death spiral, whipping flames of fire  at whirling speed and destroying everything in its path.  Now, firefighting  efforts have ramped up to a small scale military operation.  The National  Guard deployed 800 soldiers and airmen, providing tactical backup on the  ground and also Blackhawks and (INAUDIBLE) tracking the fires from the air  and it's not carrying weapons, they're carrying tons and tons of fire  retardant, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hillary, thank you for that reporting, Hillary Vaughn there.  It  makes you realize how hard these firefighters work.  Before somebody gets  up in the morning, complains about their job, you better think about these  men and women putting their lives at risk in California and quite frankly,  police officers, firefighters every day across this fine nation.  </p><p>And we want to show you this truly touching moment among all the  devastation and destruction in Northern California.  This video was posted  to Facebook.  It shows a little girl handing out burritos to firefighters  battling the Carr Fire.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at this.  Hi.  Thank you.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  Just one act of kindness among many that have  emerged in the wake of these fires.  We love to see that.  But that's  America.  That's America.  </p><p>Coming up, money in the bank, why millennials' preference for cash over  stocks could cost them, big-time.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new Bankrate.com report shows that millennials prefer cash  investments over the stock market.  </p><p>Meantime, unlike their younger counterparts, older Americans prefer the  stock market as a long-term investment.  </p><p>Joining us now the author of Retired Inspired and Ramsey's Solution  financial expert, Chris Hogan.  Why do you think millennials favor cash  over the stock market, Chris?  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION:  Dagen, I think it's  because cash is real.  It's something they can see, they can touch it, they  understand how it works and where it goes.  I think when dealing with the  stock market, they don't understand it.  And people tend to avoid and not  use what they don't understand.  </p><p>BELL:  Hey, Chris, it's Lindsey Bell here.  Another thing that survey  showed was that the interest in investing in homes, in real estate, has  really dwindled among the millennial crowd.  What do you make of that?  </p><p>HOGAN:  I think for millennials, they want to be mobile.  They don't want  to be tied down.  They're not ready to make the long-term commitment just  yet.  Studies have shown, they prefer experiences over items.  So, I think  it's OK for them to rent, renting is not necessarily a bad thing.  It  allows you to save up and buy a home when you're ready to settle down,  start a family or remain in an area for three to five years or more.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well (INAUDIBLE) maybe people of your generation and Lindsey's  generation are risk averse for a reason.</p><p>BELL:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because they saw home prices collapse during the financial  recession, depression back in 2008 and the stock market collapse.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, what's wrong withholding some cash even though it's not  earning you anything?  </p><p>TIMPF:  Absolutely.  It is difficult after you see those kinds of things  throughout your life repeatedly to say all right, yes, I'm going to jump  in.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I think, you know, we definitely want to understand that  having cash and saving is a good thing for an emergency fund.  It's just  not a good long range plan.  </p><p>For example, the national average savings rate is two percent.  So if  you're parking a big chunk of money in a savings account and expecting  growth, that's unrealistic.  </p><p>So, savings is good but investing is better.  We need to be able to outpace  inflation.  So millennials need to understand this.  Baby boomers need to  understand this.  Looking at inflation hovering between 3.5 and four  percent, if you're parking money in a savings account and getting two  percent, it means your money is shrinking not growing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you -- go ahead, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I was -- I was just going to say -- I mean, there's an  irony here.  Because stocks outperform cash and they outperform bonds in  the long run.  Millennials are younger than Gen X or (INAUDIBLE) or baby  boomers.  So, they have time to ride out -- you know, another decline in  the stock market.  So, it makes sense to the end stocks if you're a younger  investor.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris, do you agree with that?</p><p>HOGAN:  I really do.  I mean especially if you look at and understand, the  stock market is like the supermarket.  There are things that you can invest  in that are good for you, there are things that you can invest in that are  more risky.  But it's like riding a roller coaster.  When you're invested,  there're going to be some ups and downs.  But if you're investing the right  way, your portfolio will be able to withstand it and even grow during those  times.  </p><p>So, investing is a long range approach.  You have to think of it that way.   And don't look and watch every little ticker symbol and all the little  emblems and adjustments that happen, it will cause you heartburn.  Don't  have heartburn and headache.  Have a game plan, long term, work with an  investment professional.  Understand what you're investing in and get ready  to win.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris, good to see you as always.  We agree today.  I'll find  some we disagree about next time.  Chris Hogan.</p><p>HOGAN:  I'll look forward to it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A financial hangover, we'll tell you how much drunken online  spending is costing Americans every year.  And what -- and why what you  drink impacts how much you spend, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top  stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Earnings driving the action on Wall Street,  three Dow components reporting today and mixed picture so far but Apple is  the number one in focus.  That tech giant's results after closing bell  today.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the tech wreck.</p><p>Key stocks entering correction territory, down 10 percent or more from  their recent highs.  Checking the market action this morning, we have a 30- point gain on Dow futures, green across the board on the Dow, S&amp;P, and  NASDAQ 100.  This after a different story yesterday, declines across the  board with the NASDAQ composite being the hardest hit despite.  But recent  weakness all of the major market gages.</p><p>Including the Dow transports and the Russell 2000 are on track for monthly  gains as we wrap up July today.  In Europe we've had some mixed markets  right now, the DAX of the three major markets there is in negative  territory, ever so slightly.  And reading on the Eurozone economy showing  slowing growth in the second quarter.  In Asia overnight, markets heading  higher across the board.  The only loser there, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Bank of Japan surprising investors by keeping its monetary policy  unchanged.  Protecting our border.  President Trump doubling down on his  calls for a government shutdown if funding is not approved. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One new development according to the Wall Street Journal, a  change in the timeline?  The President reportedly putting a shutdown on  hold until after the midterm elections.  We will hear from Homeland  Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus cybersecurity later this  hour.  And President Trump is speaking tonight in Tampa.  What will he say  then?  You have to watch Fox Business to find out.</p><p>Not taking the bait.  Kim Kardashian appearing on Jimmy Kimmel last night  where she was asked about her Oval Office visit.  What she said about the  Commander-in-Chief coming up.  The warning about drinking and shopping.   You won't believe how much people are spending online after throwing back a  few.  Whiskey drinkers are the most frugal.  We'll tell you what type of  drinkers are the biggest spenders.</p><p>We have Kat Timpf here to weigh in on that.  And so much more this morning.   She's a Fox News Contributor, Wall Street Journal Economics Editor Jon  Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you.   Nothing wrong with that though because you know what, online, you can  return almost anything.  </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, absolutely.  Except I never do  because it's too complicated.  You got to put it back in the package, you  got walk downstairs, well, tick the elevator but still you got to wait for  elevator rather than stay on couch.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We weigh in.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  To hear how bourbon  drinkers fair in this whole --</p><p>TIMPF:  I'm a tequila drinker myself, so --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Tequila will get you into trouble.  Just saying.  So many  ways.  But first, two more Dow companies out with earnings this morning.   All eyes will be on Apple, that company reports after the will be.  Nicole  Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with the details.  Hey, Nicole.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, guys.   All right.  Note to self.  No drinking and shopping.  Looking at the  earnings overall.  So, so far we're beating for estimates overall, tech in  particular is worrisome.  But let's take a look at these Dow components.   So Pfizer, this is to the downside this morning.  They beat on profit, they  did well with the pneumonia vaccine or arthritis drug.</p><p>But the truth to the matter is that they lowered the revenue expectation  for 2018, that is down .3 percent.  Procter &amp; Gamble also to the downside.   Quarterly sales were below the estimates.  This is Gillette Razors.  This  whole grooming unit was a miss, and so that's also lowered, got to get to  tech.  When we talk about the FAANG index which I watch regularly here on  the big board.</p><p>I talked to the traders, I talked to people who were managing money, they  all seem to say how important is Apple is after the bell.  Not only are we  to hear about the products, and what's going on in China, we're hearing  about strengthening dollar.  All of these things have factored in but tech  in particular has been selling off without any -- they're just selling it  all.  And so, if they sell off Apple, does that mean it breaks the trend  lines.</p><p>Because I talked to technical analysts too, watching the upwards trend line  of tech.  And now forget it.  This will be the last chance to hold on to  tech, that's what they're saying.  So they've made this very, very severe  for today's afternoon numbers.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Nicole.  Lindsey Bell, really quickly on  this.  To point this out, we talk about this 10 percent correction in this  FAANG index, this is the second time it happened this year.  And also it  last happened three years ago.  So again, you want to talk about stocks  that have been able to recover from these past he sell-offs in recent years  worth noting.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Exactly.  And you've seen --  like I said earlier, some of the stocks in this index have done really  well, Alphabet which is Google, Amazon, other stocks like Microsoft, AMD  like the -- there are names that are doing really well that I think can  lift this up.  It seems to be a social media issue more than an overall  tech issue.  And we saw what Amazon reported result, that stock went up,  lifted the group up.</p><p>We'll see if Apple can do same.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great.  Switching gears.  President Trump heading to Florida  later today where he is expected to tout strong economic growth at a  workforce event and a Make America Great Again rally.  Blake Burman joins  us live from the White House with more details.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Dagen.  Good  morning to you.  President Trump reiterating yesterday here at the White  House that he is willing to meet with just about anybody.  We've already  seen the President meet with leaders of North Korea, the President of  Russia as well.  And President Trump saying yesterday that he is also  willing to meet with Iran's President Hassan Rouhani.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I don't do that from strength or from weakness.  I think it's an  appropriate thing to do.  If we could work something out that's meaningful,  not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be  willing to meet. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you have preconditions for that meeting?  </p><p>TRUMP:  No preconditions, no.  They want to meet, I'll meet anytime they  want.  Anytime they want.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did appear to lay out  some conditions in an interview yesterday saying that Iran needs to make it  known that it's worthwhile to enter into a nuclear agreement, change their  behavior in the Middle East and change how they treat their own people.  A  spokesperson for the National Security Council backed that up in a  statement saying that the U.S. would be willing to reestablish diplomatic  relations with Iran.</p><p>And could pull back sanctions but also warned the following, \"this relief  is only possible if there are tangible demonstrated and sustained shifts in  Tehran's policies until then the sting of sanctions will only grow more  painful if the regime does not change course.  The head of Iran Strategic  Council responding this morning by the way saying that Iran does not see  any value in the President's offer to sit down for negotiations.</p><p>Meantime, as well in the world stage today, Dagen, a U.S. official  knowledge of the intelligence assessment tells Fox this morning that the  latest assessment does show that North Korea is continuing to build its  missile capabilities up and that includes ICBM, the intercontinental  ballistic missiles.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Blake.  Blake Burman at the White House for us.  Here  now with reaction, Byron York, Washington Examiner Chief Political  Correspondent, Fox News Contributor.  Byron, we're less than 100 days away  from the midterm elections.  What are you listening for in tonight's rally  because there is so much on the President's plate each and every day.  And  when -- it seems like that his plate is full, he add something else.  </p><p>BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, if you talk Republican strategists  who were trying to help the Republican Party keep control of the House, you  know, they'll tell you they want him to talk about the economy, they want  him to talk a lot about the economy, they want to talk about how Democrats  want to get rid of ICE.  They want him to talk about immigration, they want  him to talk about the specter of Nancy Pelosi being Speaker of the House.</p><p>They want him to talk about all of that stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Will he?  Because again --</p><p>YORK:  Well, among other things, yes.  I think -- I think he probably will  but go all over the place, but the -- a number of these strategists have  been kind of rattled by the last month.  They were pretty confident a month  ago if you talked to them but the whole border family separation thing  followed by the President's performance in Helsinki, really spooked some of  them.  </p><p>They've seen some of the President's numbers and key Congressional  districts go down with those independent voters they're trying to get.  So  they are worried about the amount of noise that comes out of the White  House at any given time but they really wish they could keep pushing  economy, ICE, Supreme Court, Nancy Pelosi, that kind of stuff.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President tweeted moments ago speaking of adding something  else to the list of topics this morning.  Collusion is not a crime.  That  doesn't matter because there was no collusion except by crooked Hillary and  the Democrats.  Your reaction to that?  I'm sure that the \"strategists\"  don't want him tweeting about that but good luck telling the President what  to do.  </p><p>YORK:  Well, actually, the President has been pretty effective when -- with  this.  If you go back to the hiring of Rudy Giuliani and the beginning of  Rudy Giuliani kind of being the face of the President's defense and Emmet  Flood being the inside player on the President's defense.  By the way, when  is the last time anybody's heard Emmet Flood come out and say anything?   Does not happen.  They clearly got kind of a two-track effort going on.</p><p>And I think if you look at the polls showing the number of people who have  confidence in Robert Mueller and his investigation that has been slowly  ticking downwards since the President did this.  My guess is the President  is doing this because he thinks it works. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Because you changed -- you get all the Democrats if you  listen to any of these other networks, they literally talk about Russia  non-stop.  They don't talk about anything that truly matters to anybody who  is working hard and trying to support their family in this country.  All  they talk about is Russia and who is getting interviewed by Mueller who is  subpoenaed.</p><p>And it's forcing the Democrats, they almost -- the Trump supporters want  the Democrats to talk about impeachment because he's a loser.  </p><p>YORK:  They absolutely do.  And I mean go back to 2006, if you remember,  George, the Iraq War was in terrible shape, George W. Bush very unpopular.   A number of Democrats were saying if we win the control of the House in  2006, there is going to be impeachment.  And it really did not fly and  Nancy Pelosi who wanted to be speaker, she turned out she did, basically  came out and said impeachment is off the table.</p><p>Now, there are a lot more Democrats who say that if the party wins, they  want Donald Trump impeached, but it's not working out that well in polls of  the general electorate.  So I think you're going to see a conflict inside  the Democratic Party in August, September, and October about how much to  emphasis the whole Trump-Russia thing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Byron, you recently wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner on  the escalating fear that's approaching as the midterms this fall becoming  increasingly imminent.  You write this.  Perhaps the biggest underlying  question of the coming elections is the relationship between presidential  job approval and the House GOP's reelection chances.  It's often observed  that Trump is keeping the favor of his base supporters.</p><p>He is but Republican -- something you just mentioned Republican strategists  are watching his approval sink.  In some educated affluent Congressional  districts with lots of independent voters, the party needs to hold the  House.  I mean, how do you reconcile these two because we were talking to  Congressman Ron DeSantis who's running for the governor of Florida earlier. </p><p>And President Trump's endorsement of this man, completely shifted the  momentum away from his Republican opponent and he has a double-digit lead  in the polls in Florida right now for the upcoming primary.  </p><p>YORK:  Absolutely turned it around for Ron DeSantis.  That is of course a  statewide race and all of the Congressional races are in the Congressional  districts.  But the big question of the midterms and nobody knows the  answer, the big question is what effect will the President's job approval  rating have on the voting?  In the past, we have generally seen the  President below 50 percent job approval rating.</p><p>It's harder for his party to keep the House.  They tend to lose more seats  but people wonder is Trump something different.  You have to remember, his  Donald Trump's personal disapproval rating was near year 60 percent on  Election Day, 2016 when he was elected.  And the number of smart  Republicans are saying, you know, I just don't know exactly how that works. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you say strategists, I have to chuckle, because, again,  President Trump won that election by being himself and doing what he wanted  to and he ignored I would say most strategists. </p><p>YORK:  Oh, absolutely.  The only thing here is Donald Trump is not on the  ballot, you might think that by listening to this campaign but he is not on  the ballot, so it's really unclear how the Trump effect will play out in  these midterms.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Byron York, always love seeing you, sir.  </p><p>YORK:  Thank you, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Come back soon.  Coming up.  Talk about a financial hangover.   The shocking new study that finds Americans spend more than $30 billion in  online shopping when they're drinking.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The president continues to tweet this morning.  He has written  this.  I am looking into 3D plastic guns being sold to the public already  spoke to the NRA doesn't seem to make much sense.  This comes after several  states are lining up to sue to stop these 3D plastic guns.  </p><p>Switching gears.  The housing market latest challenge finding young workers  to build homes.  Cheryl Casone has details on this story.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's interesting, Dagen.  Good  morning.  Young people apparently don't want to work in construction, Wall  Street Journal reports the percentage of workers who are 24 years old or  younger has fallen in nearly the entire country since the last housing  boom.  That was back in 2005.  There is no single reason for the shortage.</p><p>But when economists in the industry says the problem is contributing to a  labor shortage, that results and fewer homes being built and rising prices  for buyers.  Shares of two home builders (INAUDIBLE) toll brothers are both  down sharply this year.  I mean, sharply look at that chart.</p><p>OK.  Well, in case you missed it.  Kim Kardashian-West defended President  Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night.  No matter how hard Kimmel tried to  get her to criticize the president.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KIM KARDASHIAN-WEST, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY:  I walk in and I'm  like I look around and I'm kind of star struck from the Oval Office and the  first thing I say in our meeting, I say holy [bleep] we're in the [bleep]  Oval Office.  That's what I said.  That was the first thing I said and I  had to take a moment and be like, wait, we're really here.  I'm very  grateful and I'm very hopeful that more good things are going to come out  of our conversation.  </p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, AMERICAN TELEVISION HOST:  Oh, do you have a list now of  people that you might ask him to release from prison?  </p><p>KARDASHIAN-WEST:  I do.  I've been working on it.</p><p>KIMMEL:  Is Melania on it?  I know that you're not necessarily a Trump  supporter, I know your husband Kenya seems to like him.</p><p>KARDASHIAN-WEST:  I always respect what other person thinks.  I have  nothing bad to say about the president.  </p><p>KIMMEL:  Right.  Because you still have people on the --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  She held her ground the whole interview, guys.  She met with  President back in may to discuss the release of Alice Johnson who is  serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug charge in Tennessee.  Johnson  sentence was commuted by the President in June and she was immediately  released from prison.</p><p>And then there is this.  A new study says that drunk Americans really enjoy  online shopping after knocking back a few.  Spending a total of $30 billion  online each year.  More importantly what they drink impacts how much they  spend.  While shopping on Amazon for instance, gin drinkers tend to spend  the most an average of more than $82.00.  Rum and vodka drinkers in second  and third place both spending 50 bucks.</p><p>Followed by those who drink white wine, red wine, tequila, beer and then  the last place, I don't know what this means. Folks, but whiskey drinkers  spend an average $39.00.  Are whiskey drinkers cheap?  I don't know.  Also  note, there is a surge of drunk shopping on Saturday morning around 2 a.m.   Shoes and lingerie, some of the more popular items that are bought of 1,000  people surveyed who reported purchasing an item off of Amazon.</p><p>While drinking, about 50 percent said yes, they later returned their  purchases.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  </p><p>CASONE:  I will send it over to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Your reaction, Kat Timpf.  </p><p>TIMPF:  I mean, I'm a tequila drinker but I've definitely spent more than  40 bucks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  You tequila drinkers are like out getting in fights with  people (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just joking.</p><p>TIMPF:  You know, me and my bar fighting problem.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  No, no, no.  I was just kidding.</p><p>TIMPF:  Never been in a fight.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But by the way, whiskey drinkers having grown up down south  bourbon drinkers having fun with friends, shooting pool, like socializing,  they're not home shopping.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Right.  Well, you know, --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Like -- unlike people in New York City who were drinking gin and  tonics alone on a Saturday night.  </p><p>TIMPF:  We can't all be popular.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you are popular, Kat.  Around here you are.  Coming up.   We're taking America from hackers.  The Department of Homeland Security has  created a new cyberhub.  We'll speak with the Homeland Security secretary  about that ahead.  Plus, crude awakening.  Why one expert is predicting oil  prices could surge to $400 per barrel.  We didn't make that up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  B.P. reporting a surprising second quarter profit tripling it  $1.8 billion net gain.  This comes after the company announced a multitude  billion-dollar deal in the U.S.  Shale country here to discuss, PKVerleger  president and battle -- excuse, Brattle Group senior adviser, Philip  Verleger.  Philip, your thoughts on the state of the energy sector right  now and your protection for catastrophe?</p><p>PHILIP VERLEGER, SENIOR ADVISER, BRATTLE GROUP:  Catastrophe, yes.  Yes,  $400 is a -- is an extreme peak.  Look, I'm an economist.  B.P. has been  doing a really great job in reshaping itself since the Macondo accident.   And it's -- this is not surprising.  I mean, it's why I don't follow  company earnings.  The B.P. people have been working extraordinarily hard  to bring down costs and trying to bring the more production.</p><p>And it's -- B.P. is now leading among the super majors I think.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So --</p><p>VERLEGER:  But -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead, Philip.  Finish your thought.  </p><p>VERLEGER:  Well, no, what I was going to say is -- I mean, it's -- and they  will do better for the next year, a year and half as crude prices rise.   You know, I don't see -- $400 is an extreme point and I used to it to make  a -- try to call people's attention to this obscure regulation that could  really upset the whole economy in 2000 -- you know, lead to a situation  where consumers were paying $6.00, $7.00 a gallon election day 2020.   Something nobody wants to see.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, just to explain that.  The International  Maritime Organization ruled that Phillip is talking about requires shippers  to use only low sulfur fuel which will shift five percent of global oil  demand away from high sulfur and toward low sulfur.  That's going to bring  oil prices to 2008 peaks by 2020.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, Philip, I'd like to hear your explanation, you  put the $400 a barrel oil price out there.  How do you get to that and how  does this one obscure regulation get you to that kind of extreme  prediction?  </p><p>VERLEGER:  What it does is, you know, I laid out in 2005 why we're going to  see a $100 oil.  And the -- and same reason.  It -- what it does is it put  an extreme demand for low sulfur diesel fuel onto the refining system and  they can't produce it.  So what we're going to see is roughly a million to  a million and a half barrel a day, global decline in the use of diesel fuel  across the industrial sector.  That's what's needed to make the fuel for  the maritime organization.</p><p>For the -- for the shippers.</p><p>BELL:  But Philip --</p><p>VERLEGER:  It's --</p><p>BELL:  Lindsey Bell, I just -- is there -- you're talking about the  refiners having to change, you know, the way they refine the oil.  What  about --there's another alternative of shifts putting equipment onto their  -- to the boat to really address the emission issue.  Is that a more  efficient way, is that a possible way of addressing this issue?</p><p>VERLEGER:  Yes, Lindsey.  That's absolutely a way.  You can't -- what you  have to do is put the ship and dry if off and you put the scrubber material  in there.  So you scrub the fuel the way you scrub on a power plant.  Six  percent, maybe seven percent of the world shipping capacity will have  scrubber by 2020.  There are 60,000 to 80,000 ships they think maybe,  6,000, 6500 ships will have scrubbers.</p><p>But that leaves a huge number of ships not and many of the large shipping  companies are saying that they're going to rely on the oil industry to  provide the low sulfur oil.  Maersk has made that statement I believe and  as the big Costco shipping company from China.  So most of the, you know,  most of the shipping companies keep saying, look, it is a refiner's  obligation to do this.  The refiners aren't prepared to make it yet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Philip, it's good to see you.  Please come back, sir, often.  </p><p>VERLEGER:  Yes.  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Philip Verleger.  More Trump tweets.  President Trump tweeting  again this.  We'll be in Tampa tonight.  A big year for Congressman  DeSantis who will be a great governor for Florida.  Strong on crime,  borders and our second amendment.  Big help on tax and regulation cuts.   Lovers our military and our vets.  Has my full and total endorsement.  Ron  DeSantis who we talked to last hour still has to go up against a  challenger.</p><p>The Secretary of Agriculture in the State of Florida.  That run -- that  primary in the Republican Party for the Republican nomination to run for  governor is in August.  However, President Trump's supporter Ron DeSantis  has really turned around things for DeSantis.  He as a double-digital lead  in the polls now.  Coming up.  Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen  will join us.  She will weigh in on the department's security strategy,  immigration and much more.</p><p>Plus, a new warning for Morgan Stanley.  Why the firm is predicting the  biggest correction since February pointing to earnings misses from Facebook  and Netflix which are now in bear market territory, down more than 20  percent each from their recent highs.  We'll be right back.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL HOST:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel Court Report.  A special presentation for Fox Business.  I'm Dani  Klupenger.  Former number one Andy Murray made his return to the ATP World  Tour at the Citi Open Monday.  But the three-time major champion was far  from his bet.</p><p>Mackenzie McDonald took full advantage of a slow start from the Scott.   He's making his comeback after hip surgery.  The American closing out the  opener 6-3.  But  a slight struggling with his mobility.  Murray managed to  claw his lead back into the match, leveling it up after taking the second  6-4.  </p><p>Sheer determination got Murray across the finish line as he wraps up the  hard-fought win 7-5 deep in the decider.  But it doesn't get easier, up  next, countryman and top 20 star, Kyle Edmund.  And don't forget, Tennis  Channel's exclusive coverage of the city open from Washington D.C.  continues Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Three Dow  components among the big names reporting earnings today; Pfizer and Procter &amp; Gamble already out with their numbers, some mixed reports there.  But  this -- and you can see, Pfizer's stock down more than one percent.   Procter &amp; Gamble stock, this is premarket trading, down more than three  percent.  Again, it was a revenue miss for Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><p>We've got Apple reporting this afternoon, however, will Apple be able to  turn around the likes of Facebook and Twitter?  Talk about Facebook and  Netflix, those stocks as of yesterday in bear market territory, they are  down more than 20 percent from their recent highs.  We'll see if Apple can  buck that trend.</p><p>Futures are showing this right now, we've had gains across the board all  morning, reversing losses yesterday, 24-point gain on the Dow Futures.   Numbers on personal income and spending, come -- just hitting the wires,  both personal income and spending rising four-tenths of one percent, in  line with the economists' expectations.  The core PCE Index which is the  Fed's chosen indicator for inflation, rising 1.9 percent compared to a year  ago.  So, based on that inflation, looks pretty tame.</p><p>In Europe, we look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains in -- on  the FTSE 100 in England and the CAC Quarante in France, the DAX heading  lower, losing one-quarter of one percent.  The Asian markets mostly higher,  the Hang Seng the only loser there, down half of one percent.  </p><p>Are the bears knocking at the door?  Analysts at Morgan Stanley say stocks  could be in for the biggest correction since February.  We have details  coming up on that.  Plus, building the wall, President Trump speaking out  again yesterday on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Unlike President Obama, I just want great border security.  Our  countries have learned through hard experience that border security is  national security, they are one and the same.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President threatening a government shutdown over border  security funding but one administration official tells the Wall Street  Journal that the fight will happen after the midterm elections.  Roseanne  got the boot, Director James Gunn gets fired, one comedian says that we  should just take it easy and stop being so sensitive to everything.  You  cannot wait to hear from her.</p><p>And now, to the top story this half hour, protecting America, the  Department of Homeland Security hosting a cybersecurity summit today.   That's where we find Deirdre Bolton, she is live in New York City with the  Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.  Good morning, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Dagen.   I certainly am.  And I pleased to welcome, of course, Secretary Nielsen.   Thank you so much for the time today.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY:  My  pleasure.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, you have this huge cybersecurity summit.  You are hosting it  today, you have the head of the FBI, you have the head of the NSA, you have  Vice President Mike Pence, and then you also have tons of business leaders,  CEOs from tech, and banking, and energy.  What is the biggest threat right  now to our infrastructure?</p><p>NIELSEN:  The biggest threat in my mind is if we don't partner.  So, what  we see the adversary is doing is they're crowdsourcing.  So, they're using  bots, they're using paid influencers, they're using their governments,  they're using anyone and everyone that can attack us.  So, the biggest  threat is if we don't work together to counter that.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, give me, if you don't mind, Secretary, in order of  aggressivity, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, unknown.  So, that's one  through five, who's attacking us the most?</p><p>NIELSEN:  OK.  So, it's a good question.  They all have slightly different  note.  So, I would say Russia is very active, they'll continue to be  active, we've seen meddling in the election, we've seen meddling with our  industrial control systems, we've seen meddling with routers.  China has  more of a long view, so they're looking more to understand our systems  particularly in government, understand who's who, get different access to  systems.  Iran we see very active and North Korea both but general in their  regions.  So, they have the capability, we know they have the intent but we  don't see them quite as active towards us.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, what's our response, what's our strategy?  You attack us, we  hit back 10 times as hard?  What can we do to take away an incentive to  keep trying to figure out our systems?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  I mean, I (INAUDIBLE) we do have to move from complacency  to consequences and I think you've seen that.  So, whether it's through  legal means such as indictments, whether it's through sanctions through the  Treasury Department, whether it's through diplomatic means such as P&amp;G, we  have to have consequences for the activities.  We have to call them out and  hold them responsible.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, you're creating a risk management center, and it goes back to  this point about coordination, where you really feel the government and  private enterprise needs to be coordinated because some business leaders  have complained, like, even when I think I'm hacked I don't know who to  call.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>BOLTON:  Is this the answer, the risk management center.</p><p>NIELSEN:  (INAUDIBLE) never call 911.  We saw that happened before  (INAUDIBLE) communities.  No, I think it is.  So, how it is now, we have  different intel that comes in so we collate at the government level, all  the intel unclass and classified.  But we needed the private sector  perspective to understand the context to which to imply that intel.  So,  for example, working very closely with the energy sector, the finance  sector, and the com sector, if we have a piece of intel, we can see how it  fits in to their operational environment and how it could affect them.   That helps us prepare, helps them prepare, and helps us be ready for the  systemic threats.</p><p>BOLTON:  So, you mentioned energy, I've heard some people say, parts of our  system are so old that it's actually hard to hack, but then we've seen  evidence of Russia actually having a certain amount of success in breaching  some ports which normally shouldn't have been breached.  How do you see it?</p><p>NIELSEN:  They're trying, for sure.  I mean, I think they have some  capabilities that's seen in Ukraine, they sort of continue to scan and  attempt to access our systems in the U.S.  There was one limited  distribution asset that they did attack.  It would not have had effect on  the larger grid, but your point is valid.  So, working very closely with  the Department of Energy and Secretary Perry will be joining us today to  help give the perspective from the energy sector.</p><p>BOLTON:  Of all the systems that we have, whether it's banking or whether  it's internet security, or whether it's the energy grid, what are you most  worried about?  What keeps you up at night in this cyber context?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I'm just worried about being behind, right?  So, they continue to  innovate daily, sometimes by the minute in terms of their different ways  that they're attacking us.  So, we have to keep up.  They're crowdsourcing  their attacks that I mentioned earlier so we have to have that partnership.   But really, it's evolving threats.  So, I worry that at given times, we  might not have the authority and resources we need to combat them  effectively.  So, it's moving towards our toes.</p><p>BOLTON:  When you talk about resources, what is it like for you to recruit  because I'm thinking of computer scientists coming out of MIT would  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, that's who you need.  You need these code breakers, you  need these hackers.  It's easier for them to go and work in Silicon Valley.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, it is.  It's much more lucrative.  We're working on a  variety of different initiatives, everything from exchanging partners with  the private sector, so we have a loan executive program, but we also  actually are doing something that I think is quite innovative which is  working with GSA to develop a whole new GSA system to hire federal  employees, that's really based on their skill sets in cyber which might not  necessarily equate to the traditional educational requirements.</p><p>BOLTON:  Now, I know as we talked about it, you have CEOs here.  How  cooperative is private enterprise with the government.  There's a lot of  people who don't trust the government.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, it's taken the DHS about 15 years old, it's taken us  probably all 15 of those years to build up the trust.  When used to say  we're from the government, we're here to help, it wasn't really something  people wanted to hear, but I think what you'll hear from the CEOs today is  they're coming committed to this partnership, committed -- and that's the  full -- it's not just for smiles, it's not just when the attack happens but  it's on the planning, the risk assessment, the prioritization, really  understand that interdependent fabric between all the sectors.</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.  We know, for example, at the border, Microsoft specifically  saying we don't want our facial recognition technology used there.  What is  your opinion on that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I will see to Microsoft their thoughts on that, but sometimes the  biometric technology is actually fastest way to confirm an identity.  So,  we use facial recognition in limited ways right now within the air domain,  within aviation, and we find that vastly increases the ability of  (INAUDIBLE) of passengers.  So, if it's something we can do faster to make  it more efficient while still keeping it secured, at DHS, we'll always look  for opportunities.</p><p>BOLTON:  Secretary Nielsen, before we let you go, how do you see this idea  of a border wall fitting in with immigration policy and how that fits with  security and cybersecurity?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, all of this together, we're sort of talking about different  walls, aren't we?  So, on the border, walls work.  We've seen that in  (INAUDIBLE) we've seen that in San Diego, we've seen that in other  countries.  When the wall goes out, it does absolutely serve as not just a  deterrent but a physical barrier that makes it much more difficult to  access.  The same can be true of cyber, so what we're looking at is a  system of systems of approach, some are firewalls, but much more than that,  it's monitoring on the systems, looking at the network traffic, identifying  the threat indicator sharing, mitigation measures.  So, similar to  immigration, you have to have -- you have to have many, many layers of  security in order to assure ourselves we're protecting Americans.</p><p>BOLTON:  Do you think we're going to see a shutdown based on this issue?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I think the president has been clear as to what he believes is  needed for border security, but from my perspective, we'll continue to work  with the appropriators and work with Congress so I can make sure that the  men and women of DHS have what they need to do their jobs.</p><p>BOLTON:  All right.  Secretary Nielsen, thank you for the time.  We  appreciate it.  Enjoy the summit.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Thank you.  We will.  Great.</p><p>BOLTON:  Dagen, back to you and studio.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that interview and thanks to the  Secretary as well.  Coming up, a new warning from Morgan Stanley, why the  firm is predicting a correction.  And after Facebook and Netflix, they're  now in the bear market territory, down 20 percent as of yesterday.  And  Leslie Jones is speaking out about comedians being politically correct.   Stuart Varney is here to weigh in, and I can't wait, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LESLIE JONES, COMEDIAN:  Stop walking around, so offended.  You're not  going to be able to survive life if you walk around offended.  Laugh!   Laugh!  Laugh!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Comedians underfire.  That was \"Saturday Night Live!\" star  Leslie Jones.  She's amazing, love her.  Telling the ladies of \"The View\"  that everyone needs to just get a life, to paraphrase.  Joining me now, the  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Hey, Stuart.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, look, I'm glad we  decided to highlight this because, you know, it's a part of life, isn't it?   You watch those late night comedians, they're awful, they don't make me  laugh, they are not funny.  I've just had a nice three-day weekend and I  took a little time to see some of these late night guys, useless!  I mean,  they're so negative, so hostile, it's all so political, so divisive, I  really welcome Leslie Jones' statement there, and she made it on of all  places, \"The View.\"  </p><p>She's saying, look, \"You can't go through life if you are offended by  everything, you got to laugh.\"  I think her message is, especially those  young people who watch the late night guys, you can't go through life like  this, you can't start out being opposed to everything and being sensitive  to the slightest slight, you can't do that.  I think her message is very  important, and I hope it's picked up by other comedians who make it -- who  bring back comedy, where you're watching their act and you laugh at it, you  laugh with them, you laugh at them, you laugh at the jokes, you smile.  If  we could get back to that, I'd be delighted, not that I will be watching  late night television any time soon again, but it would make a nice change  to our life, wouldn't it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Stuart, I will turn this back on itself, because part of  what she is saying is there are a lot of people who when those late night  comedians -- I agree, I haven't heard once anything funny in a long time  from them, but Trump supporters who listen to them, when they try to make a  joke about the President, or about Republicans, anything that anyone says,  that's meant to be a joke is offensive.  And so, in part, that's what  Leslie Jones is referring to.</p><p>VARNEY:  I agree.  Yes, that's what -- that's what she's also saying,  lighten up.  Come on, lighten up.  The job of a comedian is to make me  smile, it's to make me laugh, and that whole profession of comedians has  forgotten that message, and I think Leslie Jones is absolute right to bring  it back again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and she's also saying that people who go to these comedy  shows, who watch all of these -- the myriad Netflix specials by comediennes  and that a lot -- it's not just the comedians, it's the people watching  them.  They literally come to the table with a list of things that will  offend them, down to do not make fun of people who love cats.  I love cats,  I'm offended by you making fun of cat lovers.  It's that granular, and  that's why people are walking around, as my mother says, with a mad on all  of the time.</p><p>VARNEY:  Right.  Didn't have you have Jimmy Kimmel with Kim Kardashian,  trying to make her go after Mr. Trump or be snide in some ways towards him.   Well, that's just typical, isn't it?  Well, what are they thinking of?  I  mean, is that funny?  Is that what you want to do with your late night  spot?  I can't believe it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've made fun of Kim Kardashian a lot or criticized that family  a lot, however, I will say this, she held her ground with him.  She said,  I'm not going to say anything negative.  And you know what, she deserves a  lot of credit for that.</p><p>VARNEY:  Look, I think she deserves a lot of credit for making an enormous  amount of money without being really good at anything other than being  famous.  And that, to me, is remarkable feat.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Here's a -- we'd take that job, too, I think, if we could get  it, just being -- making -- being rich for just being yourself.  I think  that we'll take that if we can do it, but we have to have other skills.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it wouldn't work with me, I'm afraid.  It just wouldn't work.   There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, nobody understands what I'm saying.  I'm out of time  anyways, so good luck with that.  Stuart, I love you dearly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.  Great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  See you later.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He will be up in less than 10 minutes, every weekday 9:00 a.m.  to noon, Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Coming up, Morgan Stanley is  warning a correction is looming after earnings misses from Facebook and  Netflix.  We are breaking down the details, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors losing their taste for some key technology stocks,  Facebook and Netflix both yesterday, closing in bear market territory, down  more than 20 percent from their recent record highs, hit earlier this  month.  This comes as analysts at Morgan Stanley believe a major sell-off  is on the way for the broader markets.  Joining us now, S&amp;P Global Market  Intelligence portfolio manager Erin Gibbs.  What do you make of this, is it  going to be these tech stocks that lead the broader market lower?</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE:  I think  it's an overstatement to say that just a couple stocks that have been  missing, and yes, they have missed at extreme levels are going to draw all  of the entire market down.  When you look at the broader S&amp;P 500, we're  actually trading at really regional valuations.  We're looking at 22  percent growth, and when you look at the beat rates for just for a second  quarter and guidance, where the stocks are beating at about an 82 percent  rate, that's really high, that's like 10 percent higher than normal.  So,  the broader market actually looks pretty healthy and while technology has a  huge impact on it, I don't see it being able to take the entire market  down.  And the market is only up four percent year-to-date.  I don't see  that suddenly making, like, us wiping out all of the gains that we've  achieved this year.</p><p>TIMPF:  Well, I think that this report by Morgan Stanley is it's looking at  lagging indicators, it's looking at GDP, it's looking at earnings, so those  are lagging indicators.  If you look at leading indicators like the stock  market and manufacturing data, that's all been really strong.  Where do you  when you think about investing for the second half of the year, where are  you putting your money?</p><p>GIBBS:  So for us, we've been talking about the difference between the  value and growth stocks for a few weeks now, and when you look at the  return of growth stocks, they're up about 10 percent year-to-date and  values only up about two percent.  So, value has been the big laggard and  that's definitely -- if you want safety, that's the place that's not going  down because you just haven't seen this huge uptick, and that could be an  area perhaps later in the year.  I'd say it's a little earlier now, August  tends to be a bad month anyway, it tends to be a rough month, but I would  say in the fall, if -- particularly if we see any preference towards  financials, we really start seeing interest rates, the yield curve go  higher, that could be an area.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Speaking of interest rates, the Federal Reserve meets this week,  not expected to raise interest rates but, again, what will investors be  looking at?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, they're going to be looking at how the Fed  describes how the economy is doing, that really is what changes in their  statement that comes out tomorrow.  I mean, the Fed has going to have to be  positive on the economy.  You know, four percent growth in the second  quarter, inflation that's reaching its target.  You know, I think they're  going to be projecting at least one more interest rate increase and  probably too before the end of the year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And then we got a big old jobs report out on Friday.  So,  190,000 jobs expected right now.  Erin Gibbs, thank you so much, great to  see you.  Next time, more time, promise.  We'll be right back, everybody.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf, Jon Hilsenrath, Lindsey Bell, come back one and all,  thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" starts now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, it does.  And good morning to you, Dagen.  And good morning,  everyone.  Apple reports today, it's the last of the big tech highflyers to  lay out the financial results.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three,  reporting earnings today.  And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are  out after the closing bell.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the  tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory.  That's down 10  percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves.  The Dow  Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving  higher.  This after declines across the board yesterday with the NASDAQ,  the hardest hit down more than one and one-third percent.</p><p>And despite recent weakness however, all of your market gauges, Dow, S&amp;P,  NASDAQ, even the Dow Transports, and the Russell2000 are on track for  monthly gains as we wrap up the month of July.  </p><p>In Europe, mixed move to report, we have a slight gain on the FT-100 in  England but the French and German markets are heading lower.  A reading on  the euro zone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets a little changed, although we have green to  report except the Hang Seng slipping half of one percent.  The Bank of  Japan surprising investors by keeping policy, monetary policy unchanged.</p><p>Protecting our border, President Trump doubling down on his calls for a  government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one new development, a change in that timeline, the  president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm  elections.  That's from a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus  cyber security later this morning.</p><p>King James takes on the commander-in-chief, LeBron James getting political  slamming the president by saying he's using sports to divide this country.</p><p>Plus, a homeless web developer and his plea for a job goes viral.  Instead  for asking for money, he asked people to take his resume and it resulted in  hundreds of responses.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Contributor Kat  Timpf is here.  Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.   And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Much to talk about with these  technology stocks, the economy.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  We have Apple earnings  -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech  wreck, the correction continues.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  We'll see if Apple can  save the day here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear  from you as well.  I know you love talking stocks.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I love talking stocks.  I'm  like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're an expert on a lot.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That too.  We'll get to that.  And to our top story this hour,  the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp;  Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p>But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple  reports its quarterly results.  Estimates are calling for earnings per  share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.  </p><p>This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and  Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following  Facebook's massive miss last week.  </p><p>Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax.   Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a  Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a  consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite  the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and  Twitter do.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  I think that's  right Dagen.  I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the  performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak  quarter.</p><p>But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services  is performing.  And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products  likely in September.  And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a  differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like  augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy  and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p>BELL:  Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors  what they want to hear about the new iPhones?  Are they all going to be  released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year  where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p>FLAX:  I think it's possible that they all get announced in September.   We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the  devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little  bit later.</p><p>But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs  to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market.   Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if  necessary to get the product right.</p><p>And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this  single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do  over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users  trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p>TIMPF:  How about --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all  these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.  </p><p>Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether  saying, \"All right.  You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you  know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the  social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to  expectations.\"</p><p>Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you  know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p>FLAX:  I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the  growth.  And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're  growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p>Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud  business and advertising is a newer business for them too.  </p><p>In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has  telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's  really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to  navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all  appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming  to the four.</p><p>And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be --  allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their  data.  And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate  a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street  Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC  FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies,  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla,  (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p>But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the  recent high, the recent record on June 20th.  Not the first time it  happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is  the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this  year.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of  think that this move has been overdone.  This is in a sector that's  entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems  within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p>But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet,  these are all really good reports.  Even Netflix, I know it was a miss.   That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its  most recent high this year.</p><p>The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected,  do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as  the overall FANG group?</p><p>FLAX:  Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going  to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and  ultimately grow.  I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has  certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in  content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p>But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the  space as well.  When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point  on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them  and analyze them one-by-one.  I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a  brush across them.</p><p>So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to  like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends  around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth  runway.</p><p>And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's  bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're  trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term  horizon.  And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to  two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market  selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying  opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the --  again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is  extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've  entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are  made in China by Foxconn.</p><p>They can't readily shift production to another country for that.  And we  will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to  this trade fight?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could  punch back at the United States --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- if we increased tariffs.  We -- they sell a lot more to us  than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.  </p><p>So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life  more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China.   Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese  economy receptive to foreign investment.  But the -- one of the ways that  they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Exactly.  How --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- they could increase the spying that they do on their  corporate executives here and really around the world.  They could hold up  goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation.   There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all?  I  mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk  start up again between the U.S. and China.  You know, the U.S. and the  Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the  works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again?  So that's on  hold right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk  about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know,  months today all the market gauges are up.  The Dow Transports are up the  most of any other major market gauges.</p><p>But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the  overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your  age group?</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people  look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this.  I think that people are  concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.  </p><p>I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people  are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters  specifically are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say,  put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p>FLAX:  So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their  way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next  few years.</p><p>What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing,  building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to  grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.  </p><p>And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out  of digital economies.  So you take a company like Apple there are a far  reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that  is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, good to see you.  Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this  morning.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we wait for the Apple results.  Coming up, California  scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating  its own weather system.  Plus, how the military is waging the war on that  blaze.</p><p>CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual  harassment allegations.  The board of directors taking a major action to  get some answers.  More on that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we  still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain  on the Futures.</p><p>But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month  of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green  for the month.  The biggest winner are the Dow Transports.  Dow Transports  are up nearly six percent so far in July.  And if you're a big believer in  old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the  economy.</p><p>Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr  Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has  now burned over 100,000 acres.  Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this  fire right now.  This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's  history.</p><p>Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds  making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to  spread next.  Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p>At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the  wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk  helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating  tragedy out in California.  </p><p>Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to  conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of  sexual misconduct.  The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which  six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.  </p><p>CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday.  Shares of CBS are  down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking  yesterday.</p><p>Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets.  They are  shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt.  G.E. Digital has  continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment.  Company  has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation.   Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p>And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance.  A  homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes  while he was standing next to a highway.  This happened in Silicon Valley  of all places.  </p><p>Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that  read, \"Homeless, hungry for success.  Take a resume.\"  His luck changed  after his job pitch went viral on the internet.  Casares who by the way has  a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of  money.</p><p>Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even  Pandora, Dagen.  So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a  heart.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p>TIMPF:  Oh, I love it.  It's my absolute favorite, yes.  This is so, so, so  nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and,  again, it's --</p><p>TIMPF:  And anyone --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really  sad to see something like that.  But this guy, someone who believes in  himself.  He says, \"I have something to offer.  I can take a job, I can do  this for you.\"  And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can I give you the geek response to this?  I --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  See this has read another example of how tight our labor  market is.  We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies  everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people,  for labor.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill  them.  So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And so a man on a street can get a job.  But, you know, we see  this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting  jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before.   This is a great example of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It really is an incredible economy.  That it is opening  itself to one and all.</p><p>BELL:  Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you  know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted  that were reaching out to him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But some of the people at those companies when it comes to  hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to  college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible  people who didn't go to Ivy League schools.  And that --</p><p>BELL:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that  snootiness at some of these tech companies.  </p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that for a fact.  Coming up, President Trump doubling  down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not  approved.  But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p>And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again.  The details on  Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are working closely with our European partners including Italy  to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.  Now is also the perfect time to  expand commerce between the United States and Italy. </p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates  enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida  later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event  and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p>Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight?  Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they  tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying  what his supporters want to hear?</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that they're definitely a little bit separate.  The economy  is doing very well right now.  But when you talk about trade and tariffs  particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the  economy.</p><p>And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican  president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the  conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of  view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's  really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this  is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and  republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p>But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been  cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property  from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology.  When he's able to  talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together.  And  certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election  was take over blue collar America basically.  You know, he taps in to  people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p>And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally  support for him.  The question is, what does it do for the rest of the  country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through  on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000  instead of $20,000.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting  with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission.  That seems to at  least be on hold.  That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock  market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he  needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p>And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we  might have seen is that pivot taking place next week.  And so what I'm  waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese.  There  hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to  talking or is he going to ratchet things up?  And we just don't know where  he stands there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about China.  China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot  more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion  worth of goods from China every year.  They buy about $130 billion from the  United States.</p><p>China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is  beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods.  Here is  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position  overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Trump Administration is  committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.   We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles  of freedom and openness.</p><p>Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will  continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and  open Indo-Pacific.  President Trump will strike when the iron is hot  because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p>We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long  as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens  demand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p>BELL:  You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing  that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and  especially within the Asian market.  And with China in particular, these  tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to  maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual  property and technology.</p><p>The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to  the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first  thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out  of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  </p><p>So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you  know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of  the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing  what he said on the campaign trail.  He's been focused on if I said it, I'm  going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said.  You know,  he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign  trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong  direction.</p><p>TIMPF:  He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies,  things like that.  But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been  very consistent the entire time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has.  And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about  it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to  prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that.   You're going to have to wait.  I don't know when I'll get to ask them about  it but I will be asking you about that very thing.  </p><p>Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who  have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong  borders and powerful trade.  I never sought their support because I don't  need their money or bad ideas.  They love my tax and regulation cuts,  judicial picks and more.\"</p><p>\"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated.  I have beaten them  at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from  being taxed.  I'm for America First and the American worker.  A puppet for  no one.  Two nice guys with bad ideas.  Make America great again.\"</p><p>TIMPF:  Typical Trump tweet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  And he basically covered everything we were just  talking about.</p><p>Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his  back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the  agency.</p><p>And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump.

It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both  reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after  the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the  likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those  companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p>Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point  gain on the Dow Futures.  We have green across the board.  And as we move  into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday.  The NASDAQ lost more  than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.  </p><p>And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and  the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p>European markets are mixed this morning.  Right now, it's green across the  board.  We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany.  And in  Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan,  Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser,  the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again  on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all  sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful.  We are doing a  phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work.   So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President threatening government shutdown over border  security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will  happen after the midterm elections now.  We'll hear from Homeland Security  Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this  morning.</p><p>LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star  saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his  inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p>Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service  says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases  and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p>Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his  threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for  border security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.  As  you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're  going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law  enforcement very high.  But I would be certainly willing to consider a  shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  However, one administration official says that the President has  agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm  elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the  Wall Street Journal today.  Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the  Federalist.  Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for  Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes, I think that this speaks to  a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is.  I mean,  this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20  years.  </p><p>And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing  resolution is when there is a shutdown looming.  So, I think, rhetorically,  it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only  time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually  doing things.</p><p>I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official  out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind  of, soften this eventually.  This is what we have seen, kind of, time and  time again.  I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall  that Mexico was going to pay for.  And it was going to be just this entire  wall of concrete.  </p><p>And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain  sections along the border and, right.  So I think that there is the tough  line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization  and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or  just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's  already said he's going to do it.  What do you think is the point of  waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want  to delay that.  I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out  and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to  make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout  this whole time.  </p><p>And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not  -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that  this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go  through.</p><p>So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue,  and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered  on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for  the wall funding.  There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus  spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for,  essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall.  And there were  no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there  to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that  omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the  Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid  that until after November?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think what's going on here is the President has lost his  patience.  And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade  fight, you know.  In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers,  including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.  </p><p>And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to --  we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did.   And that's been the story of 2018.  I think he lost his patience on this  question of border security and the border wall.  </p><p>But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan  and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election  because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are  trying to hold to the House.</p><p>So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're  just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in  the process.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as  the Democrats.  Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell  in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative  win, and that's those tax cuts.  </p><p>And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four  percent right now.  That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so  incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are  unemployed at this point.  So, again, if you want to side -- you want to  run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  And I think the economy, even though it was  politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a  bigger priority and a bigger win.  I'm putting that in quotes than the  border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p>So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get  done before this border wall funding was able to get done.  And I think  this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party,  which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are  going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p>They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's  going to vote as a block.  And they don't use carrots and sticks.  They  don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they  want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within  leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in  order to get things done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of  Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters,  ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees.  Do  cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in  terms of messaging?</p><p>PAYTON:  Oh, I think, absolutely.  I mean, listen, if you're upset about  the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies,  there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it  and raise media attention.  </p><p>I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming  over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating  individuals coming over together.  And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p>So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled  veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer  camp.  That's not the way to do that.  And, I think, Portland mayor  reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these  protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p>I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the  Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a  border.  They don't like the fact that there are laws.  I think it's  demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I  should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I would just encourage all of these elected officials  to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and  breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking.  As if that that's not  a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many  women putting their lives at risk for that.  </p><p>Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p>PAYTON:  Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre Payton.  Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron  DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is  heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and  also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in  the show.</p><p>But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star  is saying the President is using sports to divide this country.

Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Dagen, that is right.  Credit Suisse now on track to report its  first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than  doubled from last year.  This, of course, is beating the street's forecast.   The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions  along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest  of the year.  Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the  premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.  </p><p>Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its  vehicles.  The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door  cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year.  The system lets drivers  know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even  kids.  Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.  </p><p>Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto.  Remember,  when they debuted this?  Made such a big deal about it.  Well, they now  want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead.  Uber acquired Anthony  Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they  later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's  Waymo, that he stole trade secrets.  That resulted in a lawsuit against  Uber that was settled back in February.  The move does not affect Uber  freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.  </p><p>And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated.  The  CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including  \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app.  The all  you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its  parent company ran out of cash, literally.  Take a look at some of the  tweets.  A lot of good reaction.  This one says, a live look at the  MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office.  Here's a tweet with  the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes.  Shares  of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year.  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Lebron James accuses the  president of the United States of dividing the nation.  The NBA star's  blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in  less than two years.  Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Dagen, good morning.  Some good  news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential  benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players.  News  broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry,  announces retirement having suffered six concussions.  Report release that  shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts.   While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments,  now the NFL has distributed over $502 million.  It had been projected the  league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went  into effect January 2017.  521 players have been paid.  Now, projected the  league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.  </p><p>Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all  eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment.   They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available  for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition.  The  settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their  families.  </p><p>While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between  sports and politics.  While President Trump has been outspoken about his  strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his  involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry  Jones, called his involvement problematic.  And last night, Lebron James  said this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS:  He's kind of using sport to,  kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know  that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white.  Sports has  never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings  someone together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider  that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew  they go to championship.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers,  John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said:  \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\"   President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for  divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people  in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.  </p><p>MAX:  This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you  think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he  handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in  this conversation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that this issue is just so  polarizing.  There's two sides.  Each of them feels very strong emotions  about their particular side.  There's really no solution to this that's  going to make everybody happy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me  that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this  country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to  Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down  and never gets anywhere.  So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on  this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being  kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally  dug in.  </p><p>HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had  acted strongly and it never would've come to this?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I think he was scared.  Everyone going through this for the  first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this.  What I think -- he  became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable  to do this.  What could he have done?  I've said this on the air, I think,  for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would  certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is  terrible.  It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and  the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car  knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble.  And that's where I  think Roger Goodell is.  Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt  with this.  He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you  stand for the anthem.  Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done  that properly. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and  the like, some of them keep talking about it.  </p><p>MAX:  Not easy situation to deal with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Jared Max.  His sports reports, Fox News  Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, that million-dollar (INAUDIBLE)  you've got, may not be enough to retire on.  New details on why that magic  number might need a major boost to help you shine in your golden years or  should you just spend your money now?

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three,  reporting earnings today.  And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are  out after the closing bell.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the  tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory.  That's down 10  percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves.  The Dow  Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving  higher.

It's time we had proper border security.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But one new development, a change in that timeline, the  president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm  elections.

Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.   And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Much to talk about with these  technology stocks, the economy.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  We have Apple earnings  -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech  wreck, the correction continues.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  We'll see if Apple can  save the day here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear  from you as well.  I know you love talking stocks.</p><p> KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I love talking stocks.  I'm  like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're an expert on a lot.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That too.  We'll get to that.  And to our top story this hour,  the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp;  Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p> But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple  reports its quarterly results.  Estimates are calling for earnings per  share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.  </p><p> This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and  Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following  Facebook's massive miss last week.  </p><p> Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax.   Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a  Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a  consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite  the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and  Twitter do.</p><p> DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  I think that's  right Dagen.  I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the  performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak  quarter.</p><p> But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services  is performing.  And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products  likely in September.  And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a  differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like  augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy  and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p> BELL:  Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors  what they want to hear about the new iPhones?  Are they all going to be  released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year  where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p> FLAX:  I think it's possible that they all get announced in September.   We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the  devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little  bit later.</p><p> But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs  to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market.   Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if  necessary to get the product right.</p><p> And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this  single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do  over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users  trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p> TIMPF:  How about --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all  these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.  </p><p> Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether  saying, \"All right.  You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you  know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the  social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to  expectations.\"</p><p> Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you  know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p> FLAX:  I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the  growth.  And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're  growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p> Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud  business and advertising is a newer business for them too.  </p><p> In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has  telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's  really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to  navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all  appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming  to the four.</p><p> And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be --  allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their  data.  And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate  a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street  Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC  FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies,  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla,  (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p> But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the  recent high, the recent record on June 20th.  Not the first time it  happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is  the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this  year.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of  think that this move has been overdone.  This is in a sector that's  entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems  within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p> But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet,  these are all really good reports.  Even Netflix, I know it was a miss.   That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its  most recent high this year.</p><p> The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected,  do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as  the overall FANG group?</p><p> FLAX:  Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going  to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and  ultimately grow.  I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has  certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in  content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p> But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the  space as well.  When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point  on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them  and analyze them one-by-one.  I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a  brush across them.</p><p> So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to  like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends  around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth  runway.</p><p> And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's  bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're  trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term  horizon.  And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to  two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market  selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying  opportunity.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the --  again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is  extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've  entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are  made in China by Foxconn.</p><p> They can't readily shift production to another country for that.  And we  will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to  this trade fight?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could  punch back at the United States --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- if we increased tariffs.  We -- they sell a lot more to us  than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.  </p><p> So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life  more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China.   Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese  economy receptive to foreign investment.  But the -- one of the ways that  they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Exactly.  How --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- they could increase the spying that they do on their  corporate executives here and really around the world.  They could hold up  goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation.   There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all?  I  mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk  start up again between the U.S. and China.  You know, the U.S. and the  Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the  works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again?  So that's on  hold right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk  about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know,  months today all the market gauges are up.  The Dow Transports are up the  most of any other major market gauges.</p><p> But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the  overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your  age group?</p><p> TIMPF:  I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people  look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this.  I think that people are  concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.  </p><p> I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people  are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters  specifically are.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say,  put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p> FLAX:  So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their  way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next  few years.</p><p> What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing,  building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to  grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.  </p><p> And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out  of digital economies.  So you take a company like Apple there are a far  reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that  is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dan, good to see you.  Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this  morning.  </p><p> FLAX:  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we wait for the Apple results.  Coming up, California  scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating  its own weather system.  Plus, how the military is waging the war on that  blaze.</p><p> CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual  harassment allegations.  The board of directors taking a major action to  get some answers.  More on that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we  still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain  on the Futures.</p><p> But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month  of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green  for the month.  The biggest winner are the Dow Transports.  Dow Transports  are up nearly six percent so far in July.  And if you're a big believer in  old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the  economy.</p><p> Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr  Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has  now burned over 100,000 acres.  Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this  fire right now.  This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's  history.</p><p> Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds  making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to  spread next.  Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p> At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the  wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk  helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating  tragedy out in California.  </p><p> Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to  conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of  sexual misconduct.  The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which  six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.  </p><p> CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday.  Shares of CBS are  down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking  yesterday.</p><p> Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets.  They are  shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt.  G.E. Digital has  continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment.  Company  has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation.   Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p> And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance.  A  homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes  while he was standing next to a highway.  This happened in Silicon Valley  of all places.  </p><p> Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that  read, \"Homeless, hungry for success.  Take a resume.\"  His luck changed  after his job pitch went viral on the internet.  Casares who by the way has  a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of  money.</p><p> Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even  Pandora, Dagen.  So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a  heart.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p> TIMPF:  Oh, I love it.  It's my absolute favorite, yes.  This is so, so, so  nice.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and,  again, it's --</p><p> TIMPF:  And anyone --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really  sad to see something like that.  But this guy, someone who believes in  himself.  He says, \"I have something to offer.  I can take a job, I can do  this for you.\"  And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Can I give you the geek response to this?  I --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  See this has read another example of how tight our labor  market is.  We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies  everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people,  for labor.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill  them.  So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  And so a man on a street can get a job.  But, you know, we see  this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting  jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before.   This is a great example of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It really is an incredible economy.  That it is opening  itself to one and all.</p><p> BELL:  Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you  know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted  that were reaching out to him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But some of the people at those companies when it comes to  hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to  college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible  people who didn't go to Ivy League schools.  And that --</p><p> BELL:  I agree.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that  snootiness at some of these tech companies.  </p><p> BELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know that for a fact.  Coming up, President Trump doubling  down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not  approved.  But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p> And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again.  The details on  Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are working closely with our European partners including Italy  to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.  Now is also the perfect time to  expand commerce between the United States and Italy. </p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates  enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida  later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event  and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p> Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight?  Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they  tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying  what his supporters want to hear?</p><p> TIMPF:  I think that they're definitely a little bit separate.  The economy  is doing very well right now.  But when you talk about trade and tariffs  particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the  economy.</p><p> And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican  president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the  conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of  view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's  really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this  is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and  republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p> But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been  cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property  from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology.  When he's able to  talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together.  And  certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election  was take over blue collar America basically.  You know, he taps in to  people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p> And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally  support for him.  The question is, what does it do for the rest of the  country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through  on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000  instead of $20,000.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting  with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission.  That seems to at  least be on hold.  That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock  market.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he  needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p> And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we  might have seen is that pivot taking place next week.  And so what I'm  waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese.  There  hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to  talking or is he going to ratchet things up?  And we just don't know where  he stands there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about China.  China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot  more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion  worth of goods from China every year.  They buy about $130 billion from the  United States.</p><p> China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is  beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods.  Here is  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position  overseas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Trump Administration is  committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.   We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles  of freedom and openness.</p><p> Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will  continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and  open Indo-Pacific.  President Trump will strike when the iron is hot  because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p> We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long  as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens  demand.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p> BELL:  You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing  that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and  especially within the Asian market.  And with China in particular, these  tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to  maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual  property and technology.</p><p> The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to  the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first  thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out  of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  </p><p> So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you  know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of  the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing  what he said on the campaign trail.  He's been focused on if I said it, I'm  going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said.  You know,  he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign  trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong  direction.</p><p> TIMPF:  He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies,  things like that.  But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been  very consistent the entire time.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has.  And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about  it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to  prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that.   You're going to have to wait.  I don't know when I'll get to ask them about  it but I will be asking you about that very thing.  </p><p> Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who  have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong  borders and powerful trade.  I never sought their support because I don't  need their money or bad ideas.  They love my tax and regulation cuts,  judicial picks and more.\"</p><p> \"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated.  I have beaten them  at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from  being taxed.  I'm for America First and the American worker.  A puppet for  no one.  Two nice guys with bad ideas.  Make America great again.\"</p><p> TIMPF:  Typical Trump tweet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  And he basically covered everything we were just  talking about.</p><p> Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his  back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the  agency.</p><p> And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump.  The NBA star says  the President of the United States is a divider when it comes to the NFL  protests.  The new comments, ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p> Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both  reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after  the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the  likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those  companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p> Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point  gain on the Dow Futures.  We have green across the board.  And as we move  into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday.  The NASDAQ lost more  than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.  </p><p> And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and  the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p> European markets are mixed this morning.  Right now, it's green across the  board.  We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany.  And in  Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan,  Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser,  the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p> Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again  on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all  sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful.  We are doing a  phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work.   So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President threatening government shutdown over border  security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will  happen after the midterm elections now.  We'll hear from Homeland Security  Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this  morning.</p><p> LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star  saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his  inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p> Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service  says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases  and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p> Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his  threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for  border security.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.  As  you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're  going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law  enforcement very high.  But I would be certainly willing to consider a  shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  However, one administration official says that the President has  agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm  elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the  Wall Street Journal today.  Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the  Federalist.  Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for  Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p> BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes, I think that this speaks to  a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is.  I mean,  this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20  years.  </p><p> And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing  resolution is when there is a shutdown looming.  So, I think, rhetorically,  it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only  time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually  doing things.</p><p> I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official  out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind  of, soften this eventually.  This is what we have seen, kind of, time and  time again.  I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall  that Mexico was going to pay for.  And it was going to be just this entire  wall of concrete.  </p><p> And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain  sections along the border and, right.  So I think that there is the tough  line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization  and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or  just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's  already said he's going to do it.  What do you think is the point of  waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p> PAYTON:  Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want  to delay that.  I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out  and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to  make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout  this whole time.  </p><p> And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not  -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that  this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go  through.</p><p> So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue,  and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered  on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for  the wall funding.  There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus  spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for,  essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall.  And there were  no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there  to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that  omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the  Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid  that until after November?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think what's going on here is the President has lost his  patience.  And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade  fight, you know.  In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers,  including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.  </p><p> And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to --  we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did.   And that's been the story of 2018.  I think he lost his patience on this  question of border security and the border wall.  </p><p> But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan  and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election  because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are  trying to hold to the House.</p><p> So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're  just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in  the process.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as  the Democrats.  Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell  in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative  win, and that's those tax cuts.  </p><p> And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four  percent right now.  That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so  incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are  unemployed at this point.  So, again, if you want to side -- you want to  run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p> PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  And I think the economy, even though it was  politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a  bigger priority and a bigger win.  I'm putting that in quotes than the  border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p> So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get  done before this border wall funding was able to get done.  And I think  this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party,  which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are  going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p> They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's  going to vote as a block.  And they don't use carrots and sticks.  They  don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they  want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within  leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in  order to get things done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of  Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters,  ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees.  Do  cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in  terms of messaging?</p><p> PAYTON:  Oh, I think, absolutely.  I mean, listen, if you're upset about  the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies,  there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it  and raise media attention.  </p><p> I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming  over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating  individuals coming over together.  And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p> So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled  veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer  camp.  That's not the way to do that.  And, I think, Portland mayor  reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these  protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p> I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the  Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a  border.  They don't like the fact that there are laws.  I think it's  demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I  should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I would just encourage all of these elected officials  to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and  breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking.  As if that that's not  a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many  women putting their lives at risk for that.  </p><p> Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p> PAYTON:  Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bre Payton.  Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron  DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is  heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and  also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in  the show.</p><p> But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star  is saying the President is using sports to divide this country.  Plus --  and movie pass, not getting a pass from fans after the company pulls major  movies like Mission Impossible Fallout, from its program, the internet  backlash, instant and brutal.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good news for Credit Suisse and its shareholders.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Dagen, that is right.  Credit Suisse now on track to report its  first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than  doubled from last year.  This, of course, is beating the street's forecast.   The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions  along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest  of the year.  Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the  premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.  </p><p> Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its  vehicles.  The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door  cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year.  The system lets drivers  know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even  kids.  Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.  </p><p> Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto.  Remember,  when they debuted this?  Made such a big deal about it.  Well, they now  want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead.  Uber acquired Anthony  Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they  later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's  Waymo, that he stole trade secrets.  That resulted in a lawsuit against  Uber that was settled back in February.  The move does not affect Uber  freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.  </p><p> And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated.  The  CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including  \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app.  The all  you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its  parent company ran out of cash, literally.  Take a look at some of the  tweets.  A lot of good reaction.  This one says, a live look at the  MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office.  Here's a tweet with  the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes.  Shares  of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year.  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Lebron James accuses the  president of the United States of dividing the nation.  The NBA star's  blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in  less than two years.  Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Dagen, good morning.  Some good  news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential  benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players.  News  broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry,  announces retirement having suffered six concussions.  Report release that  shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts.   While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments,  now the NFL has distributed over $502 million.  It had been projected the  league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went  into effect January 2017.  521 players have been paid.  Now, projected the  league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.  </p><p> Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all  eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment.   They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available  for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition.  The  settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their  families.  </p><p> While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between  sports and politics.  While President Trump has been outspoken about his  strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his  involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry  Jones, called his involvement problematic.  And last night, Lebron James  said this:</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS:  He's kind of using sport to,  kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know  that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white.  Sports has  never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings  someone together.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider  that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew  they go to championship.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers,  John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said:  \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\"   President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for  divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people  in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.  </p><p> MAX:  This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you  think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he  handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in  this conversation?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that this issue is just so  polarizing.  There's two sides.  Each of them feels very strong emotions  about their particular side.  There's really no solution to this that's  going to make everybody happy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me  that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this  country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to  Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down  and never gets anywhere.  So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on  this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being  kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally  dug in.  </p><p> HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had  acted strongly and it never would've come to this?  </p><p> MAX:  Well, I think he was scared.  Everyone going through this for the  first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this.  What I think -- he  became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable  to do this.  What could he have done?  I've said this on the air, I think,  for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would  certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is  terrible.  It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and  the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car  knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble.  And that's where I  think Roger Goodell is.  Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt  with this.  He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you  stand for the anthem.  Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done  that properly. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and  the like, some of them keep talking about it.  </p><p> MAX:  Not easy situation to deal with.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Jared Max.  His sports reports, Fox News  Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, that million-dollar (INAUDIBLE)  you've got, may not be enough to retire on.  New details on why that magic  number might need a major boost to help you shine in your golden years or  should you just spend your money now?

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three,  reporting earnings today.  And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are  out after the closing bell.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the  tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory.  That's down 10  percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves.  The Dow  Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving  higher.  This after declines across the board yesterday with the NASDAQ,  the hardest hit down more than one and one-third percent.</p><p> And despite recent weakness however, all of your market gauges, Dow, S&amp;P,  NASDAQ, even the Dow Transports, and the Russell2000 are on track for  monthly gains as we wrap up the month of July.  </p><p> In Europe, mixed move to report, we have a slight gain on the FT-100 in  England but the French and German markets are heading lower.  A reading on  the euro zone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets a little changed, although we have green to  report except the Hang Seng slipping half of one percent.  The Bank of  Japan surprising investors by keeping policy, monetary policy unchanged.</p><p> Protecting our border, President Trump doubling down on his calls for a  government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But one new development, a change in that timeline, the  president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm  elections.  That's from a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p> We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus  cyber security later this morning.</p><p> King James takes on the commander-in-chief, LeBron James getting political  slamming the president by saying he's using sports to divide this country.</p><p> Plus, a homeless web developer and his plea for a job goes viral.  Instead  for asking for money, he asked people to take his resume and it resulted in  hundreds of responses.</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Contributor Kat  Timpf is here.  Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.   And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Much to talk about with these  technology stocks, the economy.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  We have Apple earnings  -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech  wreck, the correction continues.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  We'll see if Apple can  save the day here.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear  from you as well.  I know you love talking stocks.</p><p> KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I love talking stocks.  I'm  like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You're an expert on a lot.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That too.  We'll get to that.  And to our top story this hour,  the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp;  Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p> But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple  reports its quarterly results.  Estimates are calling for earnings per  share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.  </p><p> This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and  Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following  Facebook's massive miss last week.  </p><p> Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax.   Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a  Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a  consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite  the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and  Twitter do.</p><p> DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  I think that's  right Dagen.  I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the  performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak  quarter.</p><p> But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services  is performing.  And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products  likely in September.  And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a  differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like  augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy  and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p> BELL:  Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors  what they want to hear about the new iPhones?  Are they all going to be  released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year  where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p> FLAX:  I think it's possible that they all get announced in September.   We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the  devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little  bit later.</p><p> But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs  to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market.   Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if  necessary to get the product right.</p><p> And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this  single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do  over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users  trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p> TIMPF:  How about --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all  these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.  </p><p> Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether  saying, \"All right.  You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you  know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the  social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to  expectations.\"</p><p> Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you  know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p> FLAX:  I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the  growth.  And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're  growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p> Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud  business and advertising is a newer business for them too.  </p><p> In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has  telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's  really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to  navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all  appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming  to the four.</p><p> And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be --  allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their  data.  And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate  a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street  Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC  FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies,  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla,  (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p> But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the  recent high, the recent record on June 20th.  Not the first time it  happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is  the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this  year.</p><p> BELL:  Right.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of  think that this move has been overdone.  This is in a sector that's  entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems  within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p> But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet,  these are all really good reports.  Even Netflix, I know it was a miss.   That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its  most recent high this year.</p><p> The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected,  do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as  the overall FANG group?</p><p> FLAX:  Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going  to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and  ultimately grow.  I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has  certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in  content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p> But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the  space as well.  When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point  on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them  and analyze them one-by-one.  I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a  brush across them.</p><p> So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to  like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends  around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth  runway.</p><p> And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's  bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're  trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term  horizon.  And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to  two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market  selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying  opportunity.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the --  again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is  extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've  entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are  made in China by Foxconn.</p><p> They can't readily shift production to another country for that.  And we  will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to  this trade fight?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could  punch back at the United States --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- if we increased tariffs.  We -- they sell a lot more to us  than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.  </p><p> So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life  more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China.   Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese  economy receptive to foreign investment.  But the -- one of the ways that  they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Exactly.  How --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- they could increase the spying that they do on their  corporate executives here and really around the world.  They could hold up  goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation.   There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all?  I  mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk  start up again between the U.S. and China.  You know, the U.S. and the  Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the  works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again?  So that's on  hold right now.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk  about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know,  months today all the market gauges are up.  The Dow Transports are up the  most of any other major market gauges.</p><p> But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the  overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your  age group?</p><p> TIMPF:  I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people  look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this.  I think that people are  concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.  </p><p> I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people  are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters  specifically are.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say,  put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p> FLAX:  So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their  way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next  few years.</p><p> What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing,  building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to  grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.  </p><p> And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out  of digital economies.  So you take a company like Apple there are a far  reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that  is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dan, good to see you.  Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this  morning.  </p><p> FLAX:  Thanks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we wait for the Apple results.  Coming up, California  scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating  its own weather system.  Plus, how the military is waging the war on that  blaze.</p><p> CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual  harassment allegations.  The board of directors taking a major action to  get some answers.  More on that next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we  still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain  on the Futures.</p><p> But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month  of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green  for the month.  The biggest winner are the Dow Transports.  Dow Transports  are up nearly six percent so far in July.  And if you're a big believer in  old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the  economy.</p><p> Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr  Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has  now burned over 100,000 acres.  Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this  fire right now.  This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's  history.</p><p> Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds  making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to  spread next.  Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p> At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the  wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk  helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating  tragedy out in California.  </p><p> Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to  conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of  sexual misconduct.  The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which  six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.  </p><p> CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday.  Shares of CBS are  down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking  yesterday.</p><p> Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets.  They are  shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt.  G.E. Digital has  continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment.  Company  has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation.   Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p> And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance.  A  homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes  while he was standing next to a highway.  This happened in Silicon Valley  of all places.  </p><p> Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that  read, \"Homeless, hungry for success.  Take a resume.\"  His luck changed  after his job pitch went viral on the internet.  Casares who by the way has  a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of  money.</p><p> Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even  Pandora, Dagen.  So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a  heart.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p> TIMPF:  Oh, I love it.  It's my absolute favorite, yes.  This is so, so, so  nice.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and,  again, it's --</p><p> TIMPF:  And anyone --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really  sad to see something like that.  But this guy, someone who believes in  himself.  He says, \"I have something to offer.  I can take a job, I can do  this for you.\"  And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Can I give you the geek response to this?  I --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  See this has read another example of how tight our labor  market is.  We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies  everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people,  for labor.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill  them.  So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  And so a man on a street can get a job.  But, you know, we see  this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting  jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before.   This is a great example of that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It really is an incredible economy.  That it is opening  itself to one and all.</p><p> BELL:  Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you  know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted  that were reaching out to him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But some of the people at those companies when it comes to  hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to  college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible  people who didn't go to Ivy League schools.  And that --</p><p> BELL:  I agree.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that  snootiness at some of these tech companies.  </p><p> BELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know that for a fact.  Coming up, President Trump doubling  down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not  approved.  But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p> And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again.  The details on  Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are working closely with our European partners including Italy  to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.  Now is also the perfect time to  expand commerce between the United States and Italy. </p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates  enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida  later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event  and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p> Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight?  Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they  tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying  what his supporters want to hear?</p><p> TIMPF:  I think that they're definitely a little bit separate.  The economy  is doing very well right now.  But when you talk about trade and tariffs  particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the  economy.</p><p> And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican  president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the  conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of  view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's  really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this  is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and  republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p> But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been  cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property  from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology.  When he's able to  talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together.  And  certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election  was take over blue collar America basically.  You know, he taps in to  people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p> And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally  support for him.  The question is, what does it do for the rest of the  country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through  on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000  instead of $20,000.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting  with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission.  That seems to at  least be on hold.  That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock  market.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he  needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p> And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we  might have seen is that pivot taking place next week.  And so what I'm  waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese.  There  hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to  talking or is he going to ratchet things up?  And we just don't know where  he stands there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about China.  China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot  more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion  worth of goods from China every year.  They buy about $130 billion from the  United States.</p><p> China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is  beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods.  Here is  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position  overseas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Trump Administration is  committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.   We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles  of freedom and openness.</p><p> Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will  continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and  open Indo-Pacific.  President Trump will strike when the iron is hot  because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p> We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long  as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens  demand.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p> BELL:  You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing  that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and  especially within the Asian market.  And with China in particular, these  tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to  maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual  property and technology.</p><p> The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to  the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first  thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out  of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  </p><p> So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you  know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of  the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing  what he said on the campaign trail.  He's been focused on if I said it, I'm  going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p> HILSENRATH:  But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said.  You know,  he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign  trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong  direction.</p><p> TIMPF:  He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies,  things like that.  But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been  very consistent the entire time.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  He has.  And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about  it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to  prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that.   You're going to have to wait.  I don't know when I'll get to ask them about  it but I will be asking you about that very thing.  </p><p> Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who  have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong  borders and powerful trade.  I never sought their support because I don't  need their money or bad ideas.  They love my tax and regulation cuts,  judicial picks and more.\"</p><p> \"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated.  I have beaten them  at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from  being taxed.  I'm for America First and the American worker.  A puppet for  no one.  Two nice guys with bad ideas.  Make America great again.\"</p><p> TIMPF:  Typical Trump tweet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  And he basically covered everything we were just  talking about.</p><p> Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his  back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the  agency.</p><p> And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump.  The NBA star says  the President of the United States is a divider when it comes to the NFL  protests.  The new comments, ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p> Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both  reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after  the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the  likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those  companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p> Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point  gain on the Dow Futures.  We have green across the board.  And as we move  into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday.  The NASDAQ lost more  than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.  </p><p> And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and  the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p> European markets are mixed this morning.  Right now, it's green across the  board.  We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany.  And in  Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan,  Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser,  the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p> Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again  on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all  sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful.  We are doing a  phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work.   So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The President threatening government shutdown over border  security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will  happen after the midterm elections now.  We'll hear from Homeland Security  Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this  morning.</p><p> LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star  saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his  inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p> Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service  says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases  and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p> Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his  threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for  border security.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.  As  you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're  going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law  enforcement very high.  But I would be certainly willing to consider a  shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  However, one administration official says that the President has  agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm  elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the  Wall Street Journal today.  Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the  Federalist.  Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for  Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p> BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes, I think that this speaks to  a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is.  I mean,  this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20  years.  </p><p> And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing  resolution is when there is a shutdown looming.  So, I think, rhetorically,  it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only  time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually  doing things.</p><p> I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official  out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind  of, soften this eventually.  This is what we have seen, kind of, time and  time again.  I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall  that Mexico was going to pay for.  And it was going to be just this entire  wall of concrete.  </p><p> And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain  sections along the border and, right.  So I think that there is the tough  line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization  and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or  just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf.</p><p> TIMPF:  Yes.  Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's  already said he's going to do it.  What do you think is the point of  waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p> PAYTON:  Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want  to delay that.  I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out  and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to  make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout  this whole time.  </p><p> And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not  -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that  this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go  through.</p><p> So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue,  and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered  on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for  the wall funding.  There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus  spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for,  essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall.  And there were  no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there  to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that  omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the  Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid  that until after November?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think what's going on here is the President has lost his  patience.  And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade  fight, you know.  In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers,  including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.  </p><p> And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to --  we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did.   And that's been the story of 2018.  I think he lost his patience on this  question of border security and the border wall.  </p><p> But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan  and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election  because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are  trying to hold to the House.</p><p> So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're  just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in  the process.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as  the Democrats.  Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell  in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative  win, and that's those tax cuts.  </p><p> And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four  percent right now.  That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so  incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are  unemployed at this point.  So, again, if you want to side -- you want to  run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p> PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  And I think the economy, even though it was  politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a  bigger priority and a bigger win.  I'm putting that in quotes than the  border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p> So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get  done before this border wall funding was able to get done.  And I think  this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party,  which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are  going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p> They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's  going to vote as a block.  And they don't use carrots and sticks.  They  don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they  want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within  leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in  order to get things done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of  Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters,  ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees.  Do  cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in  terms of messaging?</p><p> PAYTON:  Oh, I think, absolutely.  I mean, listen, if you're upset about  the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies,  there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it  and raise media attention.  </p><p> I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming  over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating  individuals coming over together.  And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p> So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled  veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer  camp.  That's not the way to do that.  And, I think, Portland mayor  reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these  protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p> I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the  Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a  border.  They don't like the fact that there are laws.  I think it's  demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I  should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I would just encourage all of these elected officials  to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and  breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking.  As if that that's not  a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many  women putting their lives at risk for that.  </p><p> Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p> PAYTON:  Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bre Payton.  Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron  DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is  heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and  also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in  the show.</p><p> But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star  is saying the President is using sports to divide this country.  Plus --  and movie pass, not getting a pass from fans after the company pulls major  movies like Mission Impossible Fallout, from its program, the internet  backlash, instant and brutal.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good news for Credit Suisse and its shareholders.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Dagen, that is right.  Credit Suisse now on track to report its  first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than  doubled from last year.  This, of course, is beating the street's forecast.   The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions  along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest  of the year.  Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the  premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.  </p><p> Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its  vehicles.  The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door  cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year.  The system lets drivers  know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even  kids.  Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.  </p><p> Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto.  Remember,  when they debuted this?  Made such a big deal about it.  Well, they now  want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead.  Uber acquired Anthony  Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they  later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's  Waymo, that he stole trade secrets.  That resulted in a lawsuit against  Uber that was settled back in February.  The move does not affect Uber  freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.  </p><p> And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated.  The  CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including  \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app.  The all  you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its  parent company ran out of cash, literally.  Take a look at some of the  tweets.  A lot of good reaction.  This one says, a live look at the  MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office.  Here's a tweet with  the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes.  Shares  of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year.  There you go.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Lebron James accuses the  president of the United States of dividing the nation.  The NBA star's  blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in  less than two years.  Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Dagen, good morning.  Some good  news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential  benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players.  News  broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry,  announces retirement having suffered six concussions.  Report release that  shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts.   While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments,  now the NFL has distributed over $502 million.  It had been projected the  league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went  into effect January 2017.  521 players have been paid.  Now, projected the  league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.  </p><p> Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all  eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment.   They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available  for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition.  The  settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their  families.  </p><p> While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between  sports and politics.  While President Trump has been outspoken about his  strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his  involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry  Jones, called his involvement problematic.  And last night, Lebron James  said this:</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS:  He's kind of using sport to,  kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know  that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white.  Sports has  never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings  someone together.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MAX:  These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider  that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew  they go to championship.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers,  John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said:  \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\"   President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for  divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people  in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.  </p><p> MAX:  This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you  think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he  handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in  this conversation?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that this issue is just so  polarizing.  There's two sides.  Each of them feels very strong emotions  about their particular side.  There's really no solution to this that's  going to make everybody happy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me  that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this  country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to  Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down  and never gets anywhere.  So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on  this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being  kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally  dug in.  </p><p> HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had  acted strongly and it never would've come to this?  </p><p> MAX:  Well, I think he was scared.  Everyone going through this for the  first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this.  What I think -- he  became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable  to do this.  What could he have done?  I've said this on the air, I think,  for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would  certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is  terrible.  It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and  the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car  knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble.  And that's where I  think Roger Goodell is.  Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt  with this.  He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you  stand for the anthem.  Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done  that properly. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and  the like, some of them keep talking about it.  </p><p> MAX:  Not easy situation to deal with.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Jared Max.  His sports reports, Fox News  Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, that million-dollar (INAUDIBLE)  you've got, may not be enough to retire on.  New details on why that magic  number might need a major boost to help you shine in your golden years or  should you just spend your money now?

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 31st. Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three, reporting earnings today. And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are out after the closing bell. We have a preview plus a closer look at the tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory. That's down 10 percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves. The Dow Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving higher. This after declines across the board yesterday with the NASDAQ, the hardest hit down more than one and one-third percent.</p><p>And despite recent weakness however, all of your market gauges, Dow, S&amp;P, NASDAQ, even the Dow Transports, and the Russell2000 are on track for monthly gains as we wrap up the month of July.</p><p>In Europe, mixed move to report, we have a slight gain on the FT-100 in England but the French and German markets are heading lower. A reading on the euro zone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets a little changed, although we have green to report except the Hang Seng slipping half of one percent. The Bank of Japan surprising investors by keeping policy, monetary policy unchanged.</p><p>Protecting our border, President Trump doubling down on his calls for a government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we don't get border security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would have no problem doing a shutdown. It's time we had proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: But one new development, a change in that timeline, the president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm elections. That's from a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus cyber security later this morning.</p><p>King James takes on the commander-in-chief, LeBron James getting political slamming the president by saying he's using sports to divide this country.</p><p>Plus, a homeless web developer and his plea for a job goes viral. Instead for asking for money, he asked people to take his resume and it resulted in hundreds of responses.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Contributor Kat Timpf is here. Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath. And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell. Much to talk about with these technology stocks, the economy.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. We have Apple earnings -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech wreck, the correction continues.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Yes. We'll see if Apple can save the day here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear from you as well. I know you love talking stocks.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. I love talking stocks. I'm like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're an expert on a lot.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That too. We'll get to that. And to our top story this hour, the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp; Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p>But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple reports its quarterly results. Estimates are calling for earnings per share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.</p><p>This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following Facebook's massive miss last week.</p><p>Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax. Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and Twitter do.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN: I think that's right Dagen. I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak quarter.</p><p>But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services is performing. And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products likely in September. And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p>BELL: Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors what they want to hear about the new iPhones? Are they all going to be released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p>FLAX: I think it's possible that they all get announced in September. We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little bit later.</p><p>But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market. Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if necessary to get the product right.</p><p>And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p>TIMPF: How about --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.</p><p>Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether saying, \"All right. You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to expectations.\"</p><p>Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p>FLAX: I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the growth. And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p>Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud business and advertising is a newer business for them too.</p><p>In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming to the four.</p><p>And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be -- allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their data. And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla, (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p>But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the recent high, the recent record on June 20th. Not the first time it happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this year.</p><p>BELL: Right. And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of think that this move has been overdone. This is in a sector that's entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p>But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet, these are all really good reports. Even Netflix, I know it was a miss. That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its most recent high this year.</p><p>The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected, do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as the overall FANG group?</p><p>FLAX: Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and ultimately grow. I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p>But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the space as well. When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them and analyze them one-by-one. I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a brush across them.</p><p>So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth runway.</p><p>And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term horizon. And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the -- again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are made in China by Foxconn.</p><p>They can't readily shift production to another country for that. And we will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to this trade fight?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could punch back at the United States --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- if we increased tariffs. We -- they sell a lot more to us than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.</p><p>So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China. Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese economy receptive to foreign investment. But the -- one of the ways that they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p>HILSENRATH: Exactly. How --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- they could increase the spying that they do on their corporate executives here and really around the world. They could hold up goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation. There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all? I mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk start up again between the U.S. and China. You know, the U.S. and the Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again? So that's on hold right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know, months today all the market gauges are up. The Dow Transports are up the most of any other major market gauges.</p><p>But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your age group?</p><p>TIMPF: I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this. I think that people are concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.</p><p>I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters specifically are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say, put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p>FLAX: So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next few years.</p><p>What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing, building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.</p><p>And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out of digital economies. So you take a company like Apple there are a far reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Dan, good to see you. Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>FLAX: Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we wait for the Apple results. Coming up, California scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating its own weather system. Plus, how the military is waging the war on that blaze.</p><p>CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual harassment allegations. The board of directors taking a major action to get some answers. More on that next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain on the Futures.</p><p>But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green for the month. The biggest winner are the Dow Transports. Dow Transports are up nearly six percent so far in July. And if you're a big believer in old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the economy.</p><p>Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has now burned over 100,000 acres. Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this fire right now. This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's history.</p><p>Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to spread next. Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p>At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating tragedy out in California.</p><p>Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of sexual misconduct. The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.</p><p>CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday. Shares of CBS are down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking yesterday.</p><p>Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets. They are shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt. G.E. Digital has continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment. Company has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation. Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p>And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance. A homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes while he was standing next to a highway. This happened in Silicon Valley of all places.</p><p>Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that read, \"Homeless, hungry for success. Take a resume.\" His luck changed after his job pitch went viral on the internet. Casares who by the way has a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of money.</p><p>Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even Pandora, Dagen. So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a heart. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely. Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p>TIMPF: Oh, I love it. It's my absolute favorite, yes. This is so, so, so nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and, again, it's --</p><p>TIMPF: And anyone --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really sad to see something like that. But this guy, someone who believes in himself. He says, \"I have something to offer. I can take a job, I can do this for you.\" And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Can I give you the geek response to this? I --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: See this has read another example of how tight our labor market is. We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people, for labor.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill them. So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p>HILSENRATH: And so a man on a street can get a job. But, you know, we see this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before. This is a great example of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. It really is an incredible economy. That it is opening itself to one and all.</p><p>BELL: Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted that were reaching out to him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But some of the people at those companies when it comes to hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible people who didn't go to Ivy League schools. And that --</p><p>BELL: I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that snootiness at some of these tech companies.</p><p>BELL: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know that for a fact. Coming up, President Trump doubling down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not approved. But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p>And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again. The details on Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are working closely with our European partners including Italy to ensure fair and reciprocal trade. Now is also the perfect time to expand commerce between the United States and Italy.</p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p>Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight? Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying what his supporters want to hear?</p><p>TIMPF: I think that they're definitely a little bit separate. The economy is doing very well right now. But when you talk about trade and tariffs particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the economy.</p><p>And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p>But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology. When he's able to talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together. And certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election was take over blue collar America basically. You know, he taps in to people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p>And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally support for him. The question is, what does it do for the rest of the country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000 instead of $20,000.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission. That seems to at least be on hold. That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock market.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p>And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we might have seen is that pivot taking place next week. And so what I'm waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese. There hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to talking or is he going to ratchet things up? And we just don't know where he stands there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's talk about China. China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion worth of goods from China every year. They buy about $130 billion from the United States.</p><p>China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods. Here is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The Trump Administration is committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles of freedom and openness.</p><p>Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and open Indo-Pacific. President Trump will strike when the iron is hot because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p>We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens demand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p>BELL: You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and especially within the Asian market. And with China in particular, these tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual property and technology.</p><p>The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p>HILSENRATH: But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p><p>So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing what he said on the campaign trail. He's been focused on if I said it, I'm going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p>HILSENRATH: But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said. You know, he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong direction.</p><p>TIMPF: He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies, things like that. But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been very consistent the entire time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He has. And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that. You're going to have to wait. I don't know when I'll get to ask them about it but I will be asking you about that very thing.</p><p>Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade. I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas. They love my tax and regulation cuts, judicial picks and more.\"</p><p>\"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated. I have beaten them at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed. I'm for America First and the American worker. A puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America great again.\"</p><p>TIMPF: Typical Trump tweet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it is. And he basically covered everything we were just talking about.</p><p>Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the agency.</p><p>And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump. The NBA star says the President of the United States is a divider when it comes to the NFL protests. The new comments, ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p>Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point gain on the Dow Futures. We have green across the board. And as we move into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday. The NASDAQ lost more than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.</p><p>And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p>European markets are mixed this morning. Right now, it's green across the board. We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany. And in Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan, Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful. We are doing a phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work. So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President threatening government shutdown over border security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will happen after the midterm elections now. We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this morning.</p><p>LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p>Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p>Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for border security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done. As you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law enforcement very high. But I would be certainly willing to consider a shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: However, one administration official says that the President has agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the Wall Street Journal today. Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the Federalist. Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: Yes, I think that this speaks to a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is. I mean, this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20 years.</p><p>And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing resolution is when there is a shutdown looming. So, I think, rhetorically, it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually doing things.</p><p>I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind of, soften this eventually. This is what we have seen, kind of, time and time again. I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall that Mexico was going to pay for. And it was going to be just this entire wall of concrete.</p><p>And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain sections along the border and, right. So I think that there is the tough line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kat Timpf.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's already said he's going to do it. What do you think is the point of waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p>PAYTON: Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want to delay that. I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout this whole time.</p><p>And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go through.</p><p>So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue, and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for the wall funding. There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for, essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall. And there were no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid that until after November?</p><p>HILSENRATH: I think what's going on here is the President has lost his patience. And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade fight, you know. In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers, including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.</p><p>And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to -- we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did. And that's been the story of 2018. I think he lost his patience on this question of border security and the border wall.</p><p>But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are trying to hold to the House.</p><p>So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in the process.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as the Democrats. Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative win, and that's those tax cuts.</p><p>And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four percent right now. That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are unemployed at this point. So, again, if you want to side -- you want to run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p>PAYTON: Yes, absolutely. And I think the economy, even though it was politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a bigger priority and a bigger win. I'm putting that in quotes than the border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p>So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get done before this border wall funding was able to get done. And I think this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party, which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p>They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's going to vote as a block. And they don't use carrots and sticks. They don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in order to get things done.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters, ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees. Do cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in terms of messaging?</p><p>PAYTON: Oh, I think, absolutely. I mean, listen, if you're upset about the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies, there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it and raise media attention.</p><p>I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating individuals coming over together. And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p>So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer camp. That's not the way to do that. And, I think, Portland mayor reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p>I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a border. They don't like the fact that there are laws. I think it's demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. And I would just encourage all of these elected officials to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking. As if that that's not a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many women putting their lives at risk for that.</p><p>Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p>PAYTON: Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bre Payton. Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in the show.</p><p>But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star is saying the President is using sports to divide this country. Plus -- and movie pass, not getting a pass from fans after the company pulls major movies like Mission Impossible Fallout, from its program, the internet backlash, instant and brutal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good news for Credit Suisse and its shareholders. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Dagen, that is right. Credit Suisse now on track to report its first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than doubled from last year. This, of course, is beating the street's forecast. The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest of the year. Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.</p><p>Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its vehicles. The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year. The system lets drivers know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even kids. Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.</p><p>Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto. Remember, when they debuted this? Made such a big deal about it. Well, they now want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead. Uber acquired Anthony Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's Waymo, that he stole trade secrets. That resulted in a lawsuit against Uber that was settled back in February. The move does not affect Uber freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.</p><p>And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated. The CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app. The all you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its parent company ran out of cash, literally. Take a look at some of the tweets. A lot of good reaction. This one says, a live look at the MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office. Here's a tweet with the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes. Shares of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year. There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl. Coming up, Lebron James accuses the president of the United States of dividing the nation. The NBA star's blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in less than two years. Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Dagen, good morning. Some good news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players. News broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry, announces retirement having suffered six concussions. Report release that shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts. While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments, now the NFL has distributed over $502 million. It had been projected the league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went into effect January 2017. 521 players have been paid. Now, projected the league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.</p><p>Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment. They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition. The settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their families.</p><p>While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between sports and politics. While President Trump has been outspoken about his strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry Jones, called his involvement problematic. And last night, Lebron James said this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS: He's kind of using sport to, kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white. Sports has never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings someone together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew they go to championship.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers, John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said: \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\" President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.</p><p>MAX: This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in this conversation?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that this issue is just so polarizing. There's two sides. Each of them feels very strong emotions about their particular side. There's really no solution to this that's going to make everybody happy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down and never gets anywhere. So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally dug in.</p><p>HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had acted strongly and it never would've come to this?</p><p>MAX: Well, I think he was scared. Everyone going through this for the first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this. What I think -- he became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable to do this. What could he have done? I've said this on the air, I think, for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is terrible. It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble. And that's where I think Roger Goodell is. Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt with this. He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you stand for the anthem. Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done that properly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and the like, some of them keep talking about it.</p><p>MAX: Not easy situation to deal with.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you, Jared Max. His sports reports, Fox News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115. Still ahead, that million-dollar (INAUDIBLE) you've got, may not be enough to retire on. New details on why that magic number might need a major boost to help you shine in your golden years or should you just spend your money now?

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st.  Your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earnings driving the action, three Dow components, count them three,  reporting earnings today.  And Apple in focus, the tech giant results are  out after the closing bell.  We have a preview plus a closer look at the  tech wreck with key stocks entering correction territory.  That's down 10  percent from the recent high.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Checking the market action this morning, we have some mixed moves.  The Dow  Industrial Futures are down five points but the S&amp;P and NASDAQ moving  higher.  This after declines across the board yesterday with the NASDAQ,  the hardest hit down more than one and one-third percent.</p><p>And despite recent weakness however, all of your market gauges, Dow, S&amp;P,  NASDAQ, even the Dow Transports, and the Russell2000 are on track for  monthly gains as we wrap up the month of July.  </p><p>In Europe, mixed move to report, we have a slight gain on the FT-100 in  England but the French and German markets are heading lower.  A reading on  the euro zone economy showing slowing growth in the second quarter.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets a little changed, although we have green to  report except the Hang Seng slipping half of one percent.  The Bank of  Japan surprising investors by keeping policy, monetary policy unchanged.</p><p>Protecting our border, President Trump doubling down on his calls for a  government shutdown if funding is not approved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't get border  security after many, many years of talk within the United States, I would  have no problem doing a shutdown.  It's time we had proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But one new development, a change in that timeline, the  president is said to be putting a shutdown on hold until after the midterm  elections.  That's from a report in the Wall Street Journal this morning.</p><p>We'll hear from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on that, plus  cyber security later this morning.</p><p>King James takes on the commander-in-chief, LeBron James getting political  slamming the president by saying he's using sports to divide this country.</p><p>Plus, a homeless web developer and his plea for a job goes viral.  Instead  for asking for money, he asked people to take his resume and it resulted in  hundreds of responses.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Contributor Kat  Timpf is here.  Wall Street Journal Global Economics Editor Jon Hilsenrath.   And CFRA Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  Much to talk about with these  technology stocks, the economy.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  We have Apple earnings  -- Apple earnings coming out later today and we have to see if this tech  wreck, the correction continues.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Yes.  We'll see if Apple can  save the day here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you just teed up our A block ladies and gents, we'll hear  from you as well.  I know you love talking stocks.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  I love talking stocks.  I'm  like the biggest expert on this panel easily when it comes to stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're an expert on a lot.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That too.  We'll get to that.  And to our top story this hour,  the earnings parade continues with Dow Components Pfizer and Proctor &amp;  Gamble reporting before the opening bell this morning.</p><p>But the earning story comes, the real one comes after the bell when Apple  reports its quarterly results.  Estimates are calling for earnings per  share of $2.18 a share on revenue of $52.34 billion.  </p><p>This is the so-called FANG stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and  Google suffered another day of selling yesterday file -- following  Facebook's massive miss last week.  </p><p>Joining us now Senior Research Analyst at Neuberger Berman, Daniel Flax.   Daniel, what are you looking for from Apple because this -- again, a  Facebook and a Twitter problem, those are social media networks, Apple is a  consumer like an electronics giant and they don't have the same -- quite  the same privacy problems and user growth problems that a Facebook and  Twitter do.</p><p>DANIEL FLAX, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, NEUBERGER BERMAN:  I think that's  right Dagen.  I think what we'll look for this evening is certainly the  performance of the iPhone business which we know is in a seasonally weak  quarter.</p><p>But also the health of the ecosystem and really understanding how services  is performing.  And then looking out we'll, of course, get new products  likely in September.  And ultimately the key for Apple is to build a  differentiated user experience and leverage newer technologies like  augmented reality in order to attract new users and keep their users happy  and ultimately within their ecosystem.</p><p>BELL:  Do you think that Apple is going to be able to provide investors  what they want to hear about the new iPhones?  Are they all going to be  released in September or are we going to see like what we saw last year  where somewhere released in September and then December quarter?</p><p>FLAX:  I think it's possible that they all get announced in September.   We'll have to see with the production ramp whether the availability of the  devices will all be in September or some or one of them might come a little  bit later.</p><p>But ultimately I think what's key for the company is that the product needs  to be ready when they launch it and ultimately bring it to the market.   Apple what we've seen historically would rather be a little bit late if  necessary to get the product right.</p><p>And when you think about what they're doing, it's not just about this  single quarter or single product, it's really what they're trying to do  over the medium to longer term and create an environment that the users  trust them and one have a secure experience in the Apple platform.</p><p>TIMPF:  How about --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Daniel, for a long time now investors have been pushing up all  these FANG stocks, the big tech stocks together in unison.  </p><p>Are we at a point now where investors are starting to discriminate, whether  saying, \"All right.  You know, Amazon is putting out good numbers, you  know, we're not going to punish their stock but, you know, you're the  social media guys, Twitter, Facebook just aren't living up to  expectations.\"</p><p>Are we seeing a bifurcation finally in tech stocks and looking at -- you  know, pulling apart the winners and losers?</p><p>FLAX:  I think Jon what it's going to come down to is ultimately the  growth.  And so, we've seen in the case of say Alphabet where they're  growing in their core search business, in YouTube and the cloud.</p><p>Amazon which you referenced is doing a good job both in their core e- commerce platform and newer areas like Amazon web services, their cloud  business and advertising is a newer business for them too.  </p><p>In the case of others like Facebook where the growth as management has  telegraphed is slowing, you have that coupled with the fact that there's  really a larger issue at play here in terms of how they are going to  navigate the future of their user experience and as we I think all  appreciate privacy data, security, that's really I think rightfully coming  to the four.</p><p>And Facebook and others are trying to figure out how best to in -- to be --  allow their users to both participate in the platform and protect their  data.  And so the market to your point is certainly going to differentiate  a lot more we think over the next several quarters and years.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they still get lumped in altogether and the Wall Street  Journal has the story at the market sector has a story today about the NYSC  FANG Index and it includes every company, all of these major companies,  Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google's parent, Apple, Twitter, also Tesla,  (INAUDIBLE), and Alibaba.</p><p>But that's now in correction territory, it's down 10 percent from the  recent high, the recent record on June 20th.  Not the first time it  happened this year, so that's a really important reminder Lindsey, this is  the second time that group of stocks has entered correction territory this  year.</p><p>BELL:  Right.  And I'd like to hear what you have to say but I kind of  think that this move has been overdone.  This is in a sector that's  entirely dead, yet growth is slowing and maybe there's bigger problems  within the social media aspect of technology.</p><p>But Amazon had great numbers, Microsoft, Google, Google's parent Alphabet,  these are all really good reports.  Even Netflix, I know it was a miss.   That's what I really want to ask you about, it's around 24 percent from its  most recent high this year.</p><p>The subscriber growth, the net ads, the outlook was weaker than expected,  do you think that this selloff in Netflix especially is overdone as well as  the overall FANG group?</p><p>FLAX:  Well, with respect to the overall FANG group and Netflix, it's going  to come down I think to each company's ability to drive performance and  ultimately grow.  I think what we appreciate in video and Netflix has  certainly done a terrific job is that they need to continue to invest in  content and really drive adoption certainly here but also internationally.</p><p>But there's competition, of course, and others are looking to get into the  space as well.  When we look at some of the broader FANG or to your point  on the -- on a lot of these fast-growing companies, we really look for them  and analyze them one-by-one.  I think it's difficult to draw a broad -- a  brush across them.</p><p>So for example you mentioned Microsoft, that's a company we continue to  like and our research from talking to customers and analyzing the trends  around the shift to the cloud suggest that Microsoft has a multiyear growth  runway.</p><p>And so we discussed Alphabet which we continue to like but we think it's  bottom of stock because you really need to be specific in what you're  trying to look for in an investment and ultimately we take a longer term  horizon.  And so when we look at some of these names over the next one to  two years, we think they're opportunities and, yes, there'll be market  selloffs but if you have a longer term horizon they could be good buying  opportunity.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Jon, one thing I want to point out though, Apple and the --  again, the Journal has written a story about this last week, Apple is  extremely vulnerable in terms of iPhone production to the fight that we've  entered into with China because they can't readily -- their iPhones are  made in China by Foxconn.</p><p>They can't readily shift production to another country for that.  And we  will surely hear about this on the call, but how vulnerable is Apple to  this trade fight?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, the Chinese have limited ways that they could  punch back at the United States --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- if we increased tariffs.  We -- they sell a lot more to us  than we sell to them, so they can't put tariffs on everything.  </p><p>So, you know, one of the possible things that they could do is make life  more difficult for the American companies that are operating in China.   Now, it's a tough call for them because they want to make the Chinese  economy receptive to foreign investment.  But the -- one of the ways that  they could make things difficult for the United States is by --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Increase inspections, they could send an inspector --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Exactly.  How --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- they could increase the spying that they do on their  corporate executives here and really around the world.  They could hold up  goods at the ports whether they're going out or coming into the nation.   There are whole -- are we getting any information about that at all?  I  mean, is information starting to trickle out?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think the next big question is whether talk  start up again between the U.S. and China.  You know, the U.S. and the  Europeans announced last week that they seem to have in agreement in the  works, is the U.S. going to start talking to China again?  So that's on  hold right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick Kat, I want to get your sense though because we talk  about these technology stocks selling off every day despite, you know,  months today all the market gauges are up.  The Dow Transports are up the  most of any other major market gauges.</p><p>But how much does that this affect people's, if at all, feeling about the  overall economy, the wealth in the country, how -- particularly among your  age group?</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't think it really affects it whatsoever, I don't think people  look at the small, tiny ins and outs of this.  I think that people are  concerned about the tariffs specifically as we just discussed.  </p><p>I think that they are tax, tariffs are taxes and I don't think that people  are really as excited about them as many of President Trump's supporters  specifically are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, I'm going to give you final word, whatever you want to say,  put an exclamation on those fours.</p><p>FLAX:  So clearly issues around trade and tariffs are going to work their  way through the system over the next several quarters and perhaps the next  few years.</p><p>What we think is that ultimately companies that are innovating, investing,  building powerful platforms that keep their users happy and enable them to  grow can create tremendous value for the users, for the companies.  </p><p>And as we've seen in the case of the app developers, you have the build out  of digital economies.  So you take a company like Apple there are a far  reaching implications, positive implications for what a company like that  is able to build, create, and nurture for the long-term.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dan, good to see you.  Daniel Flax, thanks for joining us this  morning.  </p><p>FLAX:  Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we wait for the Apple results.  Coming up, California  scorching wildfire is so large and burning so hot that it's now creating  its own weather system.  Plus, how the military is waging the war on that  blaze.</p><p>CBS under fire, CEO Les Moonves will stay put for now amid sexual  harassment allegations.  The board of directors taking a major action to  get some answers.  More on that next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Dow is searching for some direction this morning but we  still have green across the board to wrap up the month July, 12-point gain  on the Futures.</p><p>But to emphasize this, every single major market gauge is up for the month  of July despite the selloff in technology, even the NASDAQ is in the green  for the month.  The biggest winner are the Dow Transports.  Dow Transports  are up nearly six percent so far in July.  And if you're a big believer in  old theories about the market, that is a really healthy sign for the  economy.</p><p>Moving on to the U.S. military joining the fight against the deadly Carr  Fire in California, Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right Dagen, the deadly wildfire in Northern California has  now burned over 100,000 acres.  Some 12,000 firefighters are battling this  fire right now.  This is the ninth most destructive wildfire in the state's  history.</p><p>Fires are powerful, it is creating its own weather system with strong winds  making it difficult for fire officials to predict which way it's going to  spread next.  Carr Fire is about 23 percent contained right now.</p><p>At about 800 California National Guard Troops are also fighting the  wildfire, the military has also deployed its Chinook and Black Hawk  helicopters to assist rescue crews and fire crews with this devastating  tragedy out in California.  </p><p>Well, the CBS board of directors has decided to use outside council to  conduct an investigation into CEO Les Moonves after he was accused of  sexual misconduct.  The investigation follows a report (INAUDIBLE) which  six women there accused Moonves of sexual misconduct.  </p><p>CBS reports its second quarter earnings on Thursday.  Shares of CBS are  down about eight percent this year, the board, of course, speaking  yesterday.</p><p>Well, General Electric is selling off its digital assets.  They are  shedding a key software initiative of former CEO Immelt.  G.E. Digital has  continued to lose money despite billions of dollars in investment.  Company  has now hired an investment bank to run an auction for the operation.   Shares of G.E. are down 25 percent so far this year.</p><p>And then finally there is this, pretty neat story of perseverance.  A  homeless man received more than 200 job offers after handing out resumes  while he was standing next to a highway.  This happened in Silicon Valley  of all places.  </p><p>Twenty-six-year-old David Casares dressed up in a suit, held a sign that  read, \"Homeless, hungry for success.  Take a resume.\"  His luck changed  after his job pitch went viral on the internet.  Casares who by the way has  a degree, college degree planned a launch to tech startup but he ran out of  money.</p><p>Some of the job offers reportedly are coming from Netflix, Google, even  Pandora, Dagen.  So the moral of the story, Silicon Valley does have a  heart.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  Kat Timpf, I know you love this story.</p><p>TIMPF:  Oh, I love it.  It's my absolute favorite, yes.  This is so, so, so  nice.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because it's ingenuity and --</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's, you know, pull yourself up by your boot straps and,  again, it's --</p><p>TIMPF:  And anyone --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- people reaching out to those (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Anyone can just, you know, ask for money and that's really  sad to see something like that.  But this guy, someone who believes in  himself.  He says, \"I have something to offer.  I can take a job, I can do  this for you.\"  And I think that's absolutely wonderful.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can I give you the geek response to this?  I --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I fully expect that Jon Hilsenrath from you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  See this has read another example of how tight our labor  market is.  We've got a four percent unemployment rate and companies  everywhere are just -- they're literally searching the streets for people,  for labor.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  There's more jobs right now than there are people to fill  them.  So I think that this is a great idea.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And so a man on a street can get a job.  But, you know, we see  this with dis -- people with disabilities getting jobs, ex-convicts getting  jobs, minority unemployment rates are lower than they've ever been before.   This is a great example of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It really is an incredible economy.  That it is opening  itself to one and all.</p><p>BELL:  Well -- and I think this guy actually had the skill set that, you  know, Google and Alphabet and those company -- the tech companies wanted  that were reaching out to him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But some of the people at those companies when it comes to  hiring, they can be pretty ha-ha-ha and haughty about where you went to  college and they want Ivys but you know what, there's some incredible  people who didn't go to Ivy League schools.  And that --</p><p>BELL:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that shines a light on maybe you need to wipe away that  snootiness at some of these tech companies.  </p><p>BELL:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know that for a fact.  Coming up, President Trump doubling  down for his cause for a government shutdown if border wall funding is not  approved.  But why is changing his timelines for that threat, that's ahead.</p><p>And never leave anything or anyone in the backseat again.  The details on  Nissan's innovative alarm system becoming a standard feature.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We are working closely with our European partners including Italy  to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.  Now is also the perfect time to  expand commerce between the United States and Italy. </p><p>America's booming economy setting records in so many categories creates  enormous opportunities for investment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was President Trump talking trade after meeting with  Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte yesterday and he heads to Florida  later today, expected to tout strong economic growth at a workforce event  and a -- and a Make America Great Again Rally.</p><p>Kat, what would you like to hear from the president tonight?  Because our - - the trade issue and how strong the economy are, are they one -- are they  tied together or are they opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of saying  what his supporters want to hear?</p><p>TIMPF:  I think that they're definitely a little bit separate.  The economy  is doing very well right now.  But when you talk about trade and tariffs  particularly, there are some bit of a risk there when it comes to the  economy.</p><p>And I just think that it's very interesting that this is a republican  president, this is a president who says he's conservative but the  conservative point of view has always been more of a free trade point of  view and now President Trump with his America first type of view, that's  really more of a democratic view or at least it has been in the past.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Jon, that's the interesting this is that he really -- this  is the strange middle ground where people act like that the democrats and  republicans or people who are liberal and conservative don't meet.</p><p>But when it turn -- when it comes to getting tough on people who have been  cheating us and I named China, they've been stealing intellectual property  from us, forcing the surrender of our own technology.  When he's able to  talk about that, it does bring different groups of people together.  And  certainly rallies of interesting voter-base if you will.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, what the president did in the 2016 election  was take over blue collar America basically.  You know, he taps in to  people who feel disaffected by trade in manufacturing towns in particular.</p><p>And when people see him pushing back on China in those places, it rally  support for him.  The question is, what does it do for the rest of the  country, you know, when you talk about putting -- pushing tariffs through  on automobiles, you could be talking about cars that caused you $24,000  instead of $20,000.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he did -- but he deescalated that fight last week meeting  with Jean-Claude Juncker from the European Commission.  That seems to at  least be on hold.  That was arguably the biggest concern for the stock  market.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well what a lot of people have been arguing to him is that he  needs to focus on China and stop going after allies like Canada and Europe.</p><p>And I -- we just -- it's hard to know what his strategy is but what we  might have seen is that pivot taking place next week.  And so what I'm  waiting to see is what his next step going to be on the Chinese.  There  hasn't been any talks for several weeks now, are they going to get back to  talking or is he going to ratchet things up?  And we just don't know where  he stands there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about China.  China as Jon pointed out, we have a lot  more leverage in terms of the amount, we buy more than half a trillion  worth of goods from China every year.  They buy about $130 billion from the  United States.</p><p>China is already feeling the effects of tariffs, economic growth is  beginning to slow due to lower demand for domestic goods.  Here is  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on solidifying the U.S.'s economic position  overseas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  The Trump Administration is  committed to expanding our economic engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.   We seek to capitalize an opportunities and, of course, with the principles  of freedom and openness.</p><p>Every nation of business can have confidence that the United States will  continue to create the conditions from mutual prosperity and a free and  open Indo-Pacific.  President Trump will strike when the iron is hot  because there are clear economic benefits at hand for the American people.</p><p>We seek to work with anyone to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific so long  as that cooperation adheres to the highest standards that our citizens  demand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your thoughts on that?</p><p>BELL:  You see, I think this is where the Trump Administration is showing  that they really do want open and free trade across the globe and  especially within the Asian market.  And with China in particular, these  tariffs are the Trump Administration's way of getting China to the table to  maybe negotiate better trade deal and address the theft of intellectual  property and technology.</p><p>The question is though, is it going to -- when are they going to come to  the table for us to begin negotiation?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But I'm going to take issue with that because the very first  thing that President Trump did after his inauguration was pull the U.S. out  of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  </p><p>So it's kind of hard to listen to the Secretary of State talking about, you  know, the U.S. being open to trade with the Pacific when it pulled out of  the TPP which was supposed to tighten our trade alliances with the non- Chinese -- with non-Chinese countries in the Pacific.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right or wrong though he's been exceedingly focused on doing  what he said on the campaign trail.  He's been focused on if I said it, I'm  going to do it and that's why you see this fixation on the border wall --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But that just doesn't help with what Pompeo said.  You know,  he is following through on what he said he was going to do on the campaign  trail but that means actually pushing some of our allies in the wrong  direction.</p><p>TIMPF:  He's been all over the place on certain issues, foreign policies,  things like that.  But when it comes to this America First idea, he's been  very consistent the entire time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has.  And I want to get your read, we're going to talk about  it later, I'm going to tease this Morgan Stanley is warning clients to  prepare for the biggest stock market selloff in months, so hold that.   You're going to have to wait.  I don't know when I'll get to ask them about  it but I will be asking you about that very thing.  </p><p>Meantime, President Trump he tweets this, \"The globalist Koch Brothers who  have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong  borders and powerful trade.  I never sought their support because I don't  need their money or bad ideas.  They love my tax and regulation cuts,  judicial picks and more.\"</p><p>\"I made them richer, their network is highly overrated.  I have beaten them  at every turn, they want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from  being taxed.  I'm for America First and the American worker.  A puppet for  no one.  Two nice guys with bad ideas.  Make America great again.\"</p><p>TIMPF:  Typical Trump tweet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it is.  And he basically covered everything we were just  talking about.</p><p>Coming up, the mayor or Portland, Oregon under fire, accused of turning his  back on ICE workers in support of protesters who want to abolish the  agency.</p><p>And LeBron James has a new opponent, President Trump.  The NBA star says  the President of the United States is a divider when it comes to the NFL  protests.  The new comments, ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Tuesday, July 31st, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>Earnings in focus, Dow components Procter &amp; Gamble and Pfizer both  reporting this morning, and one biggie, Apple, reports this afternoon after  the closing bell, this follows last week's disappointing news from the  likes of Facebook and Twitter that set off some big losses for those  companies and other big name technology stocks.</p><p>Let's take a look at how Futures are holding up this morning, a 21-point  gain on the Dow Futures.  We have green across the board.  And as we move  into -- the markets finished in the red, yesterday.  The NASDAQ lost more  than one percent, but we are wrapping up the month of July today.  </p><p>And every single major market gauge is higher, even the Russell 2000 and  the transports, transports being the biggest winner, so far this month.</p><p>European markets are mixed this morning.  Right now, it's green across the  board.  We have gains at the moment in England, France and Germany.  And in  Asia overnight, it was the same story, the only loser there, Japan,  Shanghai and the KOSPI in South Korea, all heading higher, the only loser,  the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>Well, it's building a wall, the wall, President Trump speaking out again  on, yesterday, on securing America's borders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have immigration laws, we have border security, we have all  sorts of things going on that are -- it's disgraceful.  We are doing a  phenomenal job, we're setting records, but we have laws that don't work.   So, we're working around those laws and it's unfortunate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President threatening government shutdown over border  security votes, but one administration official says that the fight will  happen after the midterm elections now.  We'll hear from Homeland Security  Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, on that, plus, cybersecurity, later this  morning.</p><p>LeBron James, squaring off against President Trump, the basketball star  saying that the President is using sports to divide the nation, his  inflammatory comments, LeBron James' inflammatory comments, coming up.</p><p>Plus, it's curtains for movie pass, the movie tickets subscription service  says it is blocking viewers from buying tickets for major upcoming releases  and a controversial move to try and save the company.</p><p>Now, to our top story this half hour, President Trump, doubling down on his  threat of a government shutdown if Congress does not provide funding for  border security.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done.  As  you know, we are already approving things in various bills including we're  going to be taking care of the military, we always put the military and law  enforcement very high.  But I would be certainly willing to consider a  shutdown if we don't get proper border security.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  However, one administration official says that the President has  agreed to delay the fight over border security until after the midterm  elections in early November. This is according to a story that's in the  Wall Street Journal today.  Here now, Bre Payton, Staff Writer for the  Federalist.  Bre, how important is the border security in the wall for  Republican voters this fall and would a shutdown actually rally the base?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes, I think that this speaks to  a larger issue within Congress and just how dysfunctional it is.  I mean,  this is an entity that hasn't passed a real budget in something like 20  years.  </p><p>And the only time you're able to get them to pass just a continuing  resolution is when there is a shutdown looming.  So, I think, rhetorically,  it makes sense for Donald Trump to threaten this because this is the only  time we ever see Congress actually taking things seriously and actually  doing things.</p><p>I also think it's not surprising that there is an administration official  out there who is reportedly saying that Trump will -- is expected to, kind  of, soften this eventually.  This is what we have seen, kind of, time and  time again.  I mean, you know, voters were promised a giant massive wall  that Mexico was going to pay for.  And it was going to be just this entire  wall of concrete.  </p><p>And, you know, now, it's like, OK, we are going to get a wall in certain  sections along the border and, right.  So I think that there is the tough  line that comes out and then there is a bit of a softening and realization  and a willingness to be a little bit more realistic, given geographic or  just other political constraints that he's facing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat Timpf.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Bre, this is Kat, hi, so what is the point then, of -- he's  already said he's going to do it.  What do you think is the point of  waiting until after the midterm elections?</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, I mean, politically, I can understand why you would just want  to delay that.  I think that that would spur Republican voters to come out  and say, OK, we've got to vote a lot of Republicans in there in order to  make sure that we can get the wall that we have been wanting throughout  this whole time.  </p><p>And I think it's also a motivator for Democrats to say, you know, let's not  -- let's make sure that we get our people in, in order to make sure that  this wall, the funding for this wall doesn't happen, that it doesn't go  through.</p><p>So, I guess, I can see how this is a motivator for both sides of the issue,  and I think it'll be interesting to see how this plays out in November.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath, though, I mentioned earlier, Trump has delivered  on essentially every promise that he made on the campaign trail, except for  the wall funding.  There was only $1.6 billion in that gigantic omnibus  spending bill which the President did sign, a $1.6 billion for,  essentially, fencing replacement -- fencing for the wall.  And there were  no restrictions on these sanctuary cities.</p><p>Congress carries the power of the purse, they didn't put anything in there  to deprive those cities of funding and the President, after signing that  omnibus spending bill, he was clearly upset by that.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you think it comes to a government shutdown even though the  Journal is reporting that there's some behind the scenes agreement to avoid  that until after November?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think what's going on here is the President has lost his  patience.  And this reminds me a little bit of what happened in the trade  fight, you know.  In his first year in office, a lot of his top advisers,  including Gary Cohn, tried to put off confrontations over trade.  </p><p>And then finally lost his patience, and he said, no, we are going to --  we're going to do -- we're going to move forward with tariffs, and he did.   And that's been the story of 2018.  I think he lost his patience on this  question of border security and the border wall.  </p><p>But now, instead of people like Gary Cohn, you have people like Paul Ryan  and Mitch McConnell say, all right, just wait until after the election  because this is a political loser for the Republican Party, when they are  trying to hold to the House.</p><p>So, I think, he is going to carry forward with the threats, but they're  just trying to hold them off to make sure that they don't lose the House in  the process.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, speaking of Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, although they - - some Trump supporters see them as the enemy, maybe not as much, Bre, as  the Democrats.  Nevertheless, it is the House, largely, and Mitch McConnell  in the Senate that pushed through President Trump's biggest legislative  win, and that's those tax cuts.  </p><p>And that's one of the reasons that the economy is growing north of four  percent right now.  That's one of the reasons that unemployment is so  incredibly low, that we got more job openings, than people who are  unemployed at this point.  So, again, if you want to side -- you want to  run on the economy above anything and everything else.</p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  And I think the economy, even though it was  politically difficult for them to get it done at the time, I think that's a  bigger priority and a bigger win.  I'm putting that in quotes than the  border wall would be necessarily for them.</p><p>So, I think -- I guess, it, kind of, makes sense that that was able to get  done before this border wall funding was able to get done.  And I think  this also speaks to the larger dysfunction within the Republican Party,  which is that, you know, they haven't been recruiting individuals that are  going to vote a certain way across the country.</p><p>They haven't been, you know, putting together a strong coalition that's  going to vote as a block.  And they don't use carrots and sticks.  They  don't throw people off of committees if they don't vote the way that they  want them to, and I think that that speaks to a larger problem within  leadership, that they aren't willing to use the tools at their disposal in  order to get things done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Moving on to this story, Bre, ICE, is alleging that mayor of  Portland, violated the constitution by supporting Abolish ICE protesters,  ordering the police to stand down and failing to protect ICE employees.  Do  cities like Portland hurt the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms in  terms of messaging?</p><p>PAYTON:  Oh, I think, absolutely.  I mean, listen, if you're upset about  the way that ICE is handling itself, if you're upset about the policies,  there's a way and the means in order to protest, and speak out against it  and raise media attention.  </p><p>I mean, individuals were upset that ICE was separating individuals coming  over illegally, separating families from their parents or separating  individuals coming over together.  And ICE has changed that policy.</p><p>So there is a way to affect change, and it's not by confronting disabled  veterans while he's reportedly going to pick up his daughter from summer  camp.  That's not the way to do that.  And, I think, Portland mayor  reportedly telling police to stand down and not interfere with these  protestors and protect ICE federal employees.</p><p>I think that that's totally nuts and reveals that many within the  Democratic Party, they really just don't like the fact that we have a  border.  They don't like the fact that there are laws.  I think it's  demonstrated that the Democratic Party, many factions of it, however, I  should say, have jumped the shark on this issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And I would just encourage all of these elected officials  to go online and actually read what ICE does in terms of disrupting and  breaking up child trafficking and human trafficking.  As if that that's not  a valuable necessary task that ICE takes on each and every day, and many  women putting their lives at risk for that.  </p><p>Bre, good to see you, thank you so much.</p><p>PAYTON:  Good to see you too, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre Payton.  Stay tuned as both Florida Congressman Ron  DeSantis, he wants to be governor down in Florida, and President Trump is  heading in that direction down to Tampa for a rally, this evening, and  also, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, are coming up later in  the show.</p><p>But shortly, LeBron James takes on the commander in chief, why the NBA star  is saying the President is using sports to divide this country.  Plus --  and movie pass, not getting a pass from fans after the company pulls major  movies like Mission Impossible Fallout, from its program, the internet  backlash, instant and brutal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good news for Credit Suisse and its shareholders.  Cheryl Casone  has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Dagen, that is right.  Credit Suisse now on track to report its  first annual profit in four years after its second-quarter profit more than  doubled from last year.  This, of course, is beating the street's forecast.   The Suisse Bank, though, also warning the trade and geopolitical tensions  along with changes in Central Bank policy, could hurt results for the rest  of the year.  Taking a look at the stock right now, it is higher in the  premarket up more than a little more than 2-1/2 percent, excuse me.  </p><p>Well, Nissan is installing its rear-door alert system in more of its  vehicles.  The company is going to add the feature to all of its four-door  cars, SUVs, and pickups for the 2019 model year.  The system lets drivers  know when they have left something in the backseat like food, pets -- even  kids.  Shares of Nissan down about six percent so far, this year.  </p><p>Well, Uber is shutting down its self-driving truck program auto.  Remember,  when they debuted this?  Made such a big deal about it.  Well, they now  want to focus on their self-driving cars, instead.  Uber acquired Anthony  Levandowski's self-driving trucks startup about two years ago, but they  later fired him after allegations from his previous employer, Alphabet's  Waymo, that he stole trade secrets.  That resulted in a lawsuit against  Uber that was settled back in February.  The move does not affect Uber  freight -- that's an app that connects truck drivers with shippers.  </p><p>And then there is this: MoviePass subscribers getting more frustrated.  The  CEO of MoviePass is now saying that upcoming big movie releases including  \"Christopher Robin\" and \"The Meg\" are not available on the app.  The all  you can watch subscription service first crashed on Thursday, after its  parent company ran out of cash, literally.  Take a look at some of the  tweets.  A lot of good reaction.  This one says, a live look at the  MoviePass offices -- yes, image of a burning office.  Here's a tweet with  the screenshot of \"Seinfeld\" saying, MoviePass H.Q. currently, yes.  Shares  of MoviePass down nearly 100 percent this year.  There you go.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, Lebron James accuses the  president of the United States of dividing the nation.  The NBA star's  blunt new criticism of President Trump's stance on the NFL protest next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  NFL concussion settlement payouts hit half a billion dollars in  less than two years.  Jared Max is here with the story, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Dagen, good morning.  Some good  news here: Over 20,000 players have registered to receive potential  benefits under the NFL's concussion settlement with former players.  News  broke yesterday, on the same day 24-year-old linebacker, Joshua Perry,  announces retirement having suffered six concussions.  Report release that  shows the NFL is almost a full decade ahead in its projections for payouts.   While the league had been criticized for dragging its heels on payments,  now the NFL has distributed over $502 million.  It had been projected the  league would pay 400 million, the first decade, the settlement just went  into effect January 2017.  521 players have been paid.  Now, projected the  league will pay $1.4 billion when all is said and done.  </p><p>Christopher Seeger, Co-Lead Counsel for the players says, \"We encourage all  eligible former players to immediately sign up for a baseline assessment.   They can take comfort in knowing that the compensation will be available  for more than 60 years if they develop a qualifying condition.  The  settlement, fulfilling its promise to former NFL players and their  families.  </p><p>While the NFL's national anthem debate remains, so does conflict between  sports and politics.  While President Trump has been outspoken about his  strong desire for NFL players to stand and honor the national anthem, his  involvement has been questioned recently by some Cowboys Owner, Jerry  Jones, called his involvement problematic.  And last night, Lebron James  said this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LEBRON JAMES, FORWARD, LOS ANGELES LAKERS:  He's kind of using sport to,  kind of, divide and that's something that I can't relate to because I know  that sport was the first time I ever was around someone white.  Sports has  never been something that divide people, it's always something that brings  someone together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MAX:  These comments from Lebron James nothing shocking when we consider  that he had said he wouldn't go to the White House even before they'd knew  they go to championship.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'll just point out something that one of our viewers,  John, tweeted as short while ago, as we were teasing the segment he said:  \"Actually, people in sports are the people dividing the country.\"   President Trump is the one trying to heal it by calling the players out for  divisive action, so Lebron James feels one way but at lot of other people  in this country feel -- are on the other side of the field, so to speak.  </p><p>MAX:  This morning, Lea Gabrielle mentioned that who kneeled first and you  think, wait a second, Colin Kaepernick kneeled first, Roger Goodell had he  handled this in strong manner would President Trump even be involved in  this conversation?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that this issue is just so  polarizing.  There's two sides.  Each of them feels very strong emotions  about their particular side.  There's really no solution to this that's  going to make everybody happy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I've listen today veterans like Joey Jones, he said give me  that, give me my anthem -- a man who lost both of his legs serving this  country, who walks on prosthetics and he has actually tried to reach out to  Colin Kaepernick and started dialogue, and it eventually just shuts down  and never gets anywhere.  So, in terms of people who have -- are dug in on  this, people on the players' side, people talk about President Trump being  kind of intractable but it's the people on the other side who are equally  dug in.  </p><p>HILSENRATH: what should Goodell have done differently, you said, if he had  acted strongly and it never would've come to this?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, I think he was scared.  Everyone going through this for the  first time; there's no guide on how to deal with this.  What I think -- he  became exposed does not necessarily a strong leader because he was unable  to do this.  What could he have done?  I've said this on the air, I think,  for a couple of years, I would not want to be in that position but I would  certainly get the right people involved, the waffling back and forth is  terrible.  It's like you're driving in the car and you're on the road and  the truth is, you're driving and you're lost and now everyone in the car  knows you're lost, and now you're really in trouble.  And that's where I  think Roger Goodell is.  Adam Silver, the Commissioner of the NBA dealt  with this.  He got the players involved; it was collectively bargained, you  stand for the anthem.  Roger Goodell, to me, hasn't, you know, hasn't done  that properly. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And the players -- you know, basketball, football, and  the like, some of them keep talking about it.  </p><p>MAX:  Not easy situation to deal with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you, Jared Max.  His sports reports, Fox News  Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 115.  Still ahead, that million-dollar (INAUDIBLE)  you've got, may not be enough to retire on.

In a retrenchment of one of its most ambitious initiatives, Apple has shuttered parts of its self-driving car project and laid off dozens of employees, according to three people briefed on the move who were not allowed to speak about it publicly but told the New York Times. The job cuts are the latest sign of trouble with Apple's car initiative. </p><p>The company has added resources to the project - code-named Titan - over the last two years, but it has struggled to make progress on what some dubbed an iCar. And in July, the company brought in Bob Mansfield, a highly regarded Apple veteran, to take over the effort. The new direction apparently doesn't foreclose the possibility that Apple might someday build its own car, but it opens the door to partnering with other car companies. Apple employees were told that the layoffs were part of a \"reboot\" of the car project, the people briefed on it said. Apple had no official comment and has consistently declined to confirm its automotive ambitions. But Elon Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, has said that Apple has hired hundreds of engineers, including some from Tesla, to work on an automotive project. Local officials in the San Francisco Bay Area say Apple contacted them last year about using a former naval base that's been converted into an automotive testing ground. The New York Times and Bloomberg News have reported that Apple's initial efforts to design its own car have suffered from management turnover and technical delays. Industry experts say building a car is an incredibly complex challenge for any company, even one with the engineering prowess of Apple. Automobile manufacture also poses more regulatory and legal issues than building an iPhone or a computer. But the tech industry has increasingly ventured into the automotive sector, where Apple, Google, and other firms are competing to develop software that can help manage - at least - the information and entertainment systems inside today's vehicles. Google has made no secret that it's also working on self-driving technology, but it says that it is more likely to partner with an established automaker. Automakers such as Ford, General Motors, and FiatChrysler have all said they expect to put a number of self-driving vehicles on the road in five years or less. As for Apple, under Mr. Mansfield, the company changed the focus of the car project, shifting from an emphasis on designing and producing an automobile to building out the underlying technology for an autonomous vehicle. Electric cars rely not on the internal combustion engine, but technologies more prevalent in the consumer electronics world: batteries, sensors, and software. In addition, self-driving cars could change the traditional notions of public transportation and car ownership. Apple pulled in staff members from other divisions and hired experts, growing to more than 1,000 employees in about 18 months. But as the project grew rapidly, it encountered a number of problems, and people working on it struggled to explain what Apple could bring to a self-driving car that other companies could not, according to the people briefed on the project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TBLADE-20858803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TBLADE2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5M90-RH01-DYG0-5075-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280840</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Blade All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Toledo Blade (Ohio)</publicationName><edition>FINAL Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>September 13, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002R1H</classCode><className>FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES NV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Analysts expect profit, however, to come in at $4.3bn - a 10% drop - as the social media platform ploughs more money into technology and staff to weed out bad content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-143030777</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS9-CYV1-DYTY-C3XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 28, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;
