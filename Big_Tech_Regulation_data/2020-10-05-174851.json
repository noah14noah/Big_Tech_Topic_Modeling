The Chinese app Zao went viral but soon sparked privacy concerns after users realised that they had no control over the pictures uploaded to a company specialising in image manipulation. Russia's FaceApp, which allows users to age themselves dramatically, had raised similar fears a few weeks before.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"People seem to understand privacy risks more when a foreign country is involved,\" says Adam Harvey, a technology researcher and privacy activist, pointing out that companies storing and analysing biometric data - such as facial traits, fingerprint, DNA or voice pattern - are multiplying.</p><p>Unlocking a phone with a quick glance or the touch of a finger, rather than a passcode, has become so popular that up to three in four smartphones shipped in 2019 are estimated to use some sort of biometric authentication, according to Counterpoint Research.</p><p>The use of fingerprint and facial recognition is also expanding beyond the tech sector, with car rental company Hertz and hotel chain Marriott International introducing it as a way for customers to identify themselves on some sites. However, users may be giving away more than they intend.</p><p>In return for convenience, customers give companies permission to process data that is so unique it can be used to identify someone. The speed at which companies are adopting the technology has raised questions over security and data protection.</p><p>Zak Doffman, chief executive of Digital Barriers, a company that sells surveillance technologies to defence and law enforcement agencies, called the growing commercial use of facial recognition and biometric authentication an overlooked threat to civil liberties.</p><p>Database safety is one risk. \"It just takes one disgruntled employee to walk out with an external hard drive,\" Mr Doffman says. And hackers target companies that hold valuable information.</p><p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office issued its intention this summer to fine Marriott almost \u00a3100m after hackers stole identifying information, such as name, home address and passport number of hundreds of millions of guests. The hotel group declined to comment on its procedures to keep data, including biometrics, safe. Apart from the risk of data breaches, Mr Doffman argued that too few question a company's commercial incentive when they agree to share their image, fingerprint or voice sample. The growth of Internet of Things - such as Amazon's Alexa speakers that gather and share user data - will further help take biometric authentication mainstream, he says.</p><p>\"We are so tied up with worrying about the surveillance state, but the challenge is actually coming from a different direction and there is not the same level of debate.\"</p><p>Clear, the software company behind the biometric identification system used by Hertz, says it does not sell data belonging to its members. However, less scrupulous businesses could offer \"free\" services in exchange for biometric data. \"What many big tech companies, and increasingly governments, want to do with data are to link different databases,\" says Paul Wiles, the UK's biometrics commissioner who oversees public use of such information. \"If you get biometrics, you get a unique identifier that you can use to follow a person through different databases if they all contain biometrics.\"</p><p>This would, under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, require people to consent to their biometric data being shared with third parties, but critics have questioned whether people fully understand what terms and conditions they accept when using digital services.</p><p>Biometric data can also be used to protect a person's identity. Sandra Peaston, director of research and development at the not-for-profit fraud prevention organisation Cifas, says biometric identification can help protect people from having their identities stolen.</p><p>Her organisation, which in 2018 recorded more than 189,000 cases of identify fraud in the UK, keeps a database of known imposters and shares this information with its members, which include banks such as Lloyds, Barclays and O2.</p><p>\"Being able to say categorically that you are dealing with the right person is an avenue to cut down the ways of committing identity fraud,\" Ms Peaston says.</p><p>But she did acknowledge that unlike a leaked password, the ramifications of stolen biometric data could be greater.

Ms Peaston says: \u201cYou can change something that you know, but not something that you are.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This story has been amended to reflect that the ICO issued its intention to fine Marriott almost \u00a3100m </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-90d4c8a202ba11e9bf0f53b8511afd73</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCV-VDT1-DXP9-94WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><timeReceived>5:02 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002FZF</classCode><className>MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS721110 HOTELS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS) &amp;

Shot in the head after being randomly chosen for a murder on camera by self-described \"monster\" Steve Stephens, Godwin's death was shared by more than a thousand people on Facebook before the social media platform yanked the video.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, dozens of voyeurs watched from their screens in real time as a 15-year-old Chicago girl was gang-raped. In the same city, two men and two women, all 18, were charged in January after live-streaming themselves torturing a special needs student.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Around the same time, footage of a 12-year-old girl hanging herself stayed on Facebook for two weeks, and Islamic extremists from the Middle East to Europe regularly share videos of mass murder and grisly executions by their child soldiers. All of it is there to see and easy to find on the world's biggest social media platform, which is at the centre of a growing storm of criticism for not doing enough to police the community it has created.</p><p>\"We have a lot more to do here. We're reminded of this this week by the tragedy in Cleveland. Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr, and we have a lot of work,\" Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg last week said.</p><p>\"We will keep doing all of what we can to keep tragedies like this from happening.\" Zuckerberg was speaking at his company's annual developer conference on Tuesday and turned then to business. But many are questioning whether Facebook is actually doing \"all of what we can\".</p><p>\"There are really horrific and heinous acts happening online, from child pornography to extremism, to trolling, to cybercrime and malware viruses,\" says Professor Hany Farid from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.</p><p>\"You name it, the internet is becoming a kind of a cesspool, and I think the social media companies have been very slow to respond, frustratingly slow.\" Big tech companies including Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter argue they are dealing with so much data it's impossible to monitor every video and photo their users post. But the booming success of the social media behemoths shows they are in control of their content when it makes commercial sense.</p><p>\"There's really not been that much action trying to address this in a serious way, and what frustrates me is that the companies will say, 'well, it's a really hard problem. We have a massive amount of data, we have a massive amount of users and we can't possibly regulate',\" Prof Farid said. \"I find that sort of inexcusable. The 'massive amount of data, the massive amount of users', doesn't seem to prevent them from being very effective in advertising, in collecting personal data and selling that personal data - making really a lot of money leveraging that data.</p><p>\"They harvest the data and they make a lot of money doing it so you can't just say this is really complicated - because obviously you have figured out in certain dimensions how to manage the data.\" Most social media companies rely on their users to report offensive content for their moderators to evaluate and then take steps including removal and reporting it to law enforcement agencies.</p><p>\"This is like the police department saying, 'we've got a bunch of laws on the books and we are going to sit in our office all day long and we are going to wait for people to tell us what they think is wrong'. That's their model and that's completely insane,\" Prof Farid said.</p><p>Most of this monitoring is then outsourced - such as the investigations Google introduced in the wake of the \"fake news\" controversy during the 2016 US election, which are being helmed by Politifact and Snopes. There is also an army of Facebook and Twitter minimum-wage human moderators working out of offices in Asian countries, including the Philippines, who Professor Farid describes as \"traumatised, looking at this horrific content all day long\".</p><p>\"So even at that level, it barely rates on Facebook's radar,\" he says. \"On the other hand, how many people do they have on the advertising side, how many people do they have on the analytics side, how many engineers developing the next generation of Facebook features? The labour distribution is a good indication of how seriously they take it.\" Cyber safety expert Hemanshu Nigam agreed social media companies had been too slow to respond to the proliferation of vile content, a problem compounded by their pace of growth. \"Part of the problem is that with Facebook, what we are experiencing is a technology company that is slowly evolving into a media company, and also evolving into a political powerhouse. In many ways that's creating an identity crisis, because each one of these identities comes with different responsibilities,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Nigam runs online safety consultancy SSP Blue, but was formerly chief security officer of MySpace, where every piece of media was moderated before being posted.</p><p>\"There was a human being looking at it and if it was deemed inappropriate then it was fingerprinted so it could not be shared by another user on the site,\" he explained.</p><p>\"Those were very proactive measures we took.\" Mr Nigam said such a model wouldn't now work because of the sheer number of users of Facebook, Google and Twitter, but a combination of human and computer-driven moderation was possible.</p><p>\"One of the greatest challenges Facebook faced (this week) was that the content kept being shared, and the question that was left unanswered is why that video wasn't stopped,\" he said.</p><p>The key to stopping such an event in future might lie in identifying unusual or anomalous behaviour for a particular video. \"Look at it in the real world, where you have a neighbourhood where not much is happening and all of a sudden everyone is running towards it, police cars are going towards it, things are happening. That's anomalous behaviour - people saying 'What's going on over there? Let's take a look',\" he said.</p><p>\"When you're the platform, you're the mayor, the regulator, the legislator, the enforcer, the first responder, the educator. You have to serve every role in that society that typically a government serves. That's the kind of functionality you have as a platform and that's how you have to consider it.\" Improved policing of offensive content would do more than anything to reduce its impact, Mr Higam said.</p><p>\"If you're a drug dealer, you are going to set up shop on a street corner, but when the police are patrolling more often or when there's a neighbourhood watch program, you go somewhere else and try to set up on a new street corner,\" he says.</p><p>\"The goal of the government and the community is to try to push them to a point where they give up or go underground, in which case less and less people are seeing it and are going to be impacted by it.\" Mr Higam said there were increasing signs social media companies were heeding the message, mainly on the back of advertiser concerns their products are being displayed alongside offensive content.</p><p>\"If they don't do it, one thing that's absolutely clear is that the power of the advertisers is absolutely strong enough to make change and that's probably the one thing they most understand,\" he said.</p><p>Prof Farid says less eyes on each video would likely take away one of the key motivations for sick people to share their most depraved acts with the world.</p><p>\"One of the questions you have to ask is what is driving people to do these acts now - is it the knowledge that people can publicise it, is it the knowledge that people will get an audience? How much of that now is contributing to people's actions?\" he said.</p><p>\"But what I think is honestly more horrific than what he (Stephens) did is the 1200 people who shared that video, that's the part to me that is deeply troubling.</p><p>\"Facebook knows, and they have made it much easier to share content than to report violations. Why? Because their whole business model is people are sharing content. There were a lot more shares than reports of inappropriate content. Facebook has been saying for a long time they are going to make it easier to report conduct but they are still not there.\" For the family of Mr Godwin, 74, the sharing of his death only added to their pain, and they took to social media to beg people to stop.</p><p>\"Please please please stop retweeting that video and report anyone who has posted it!

But then we discovered it had teeth and claws. Lisa Murray meets some of the social network's frontline fighters tasked with taming the beast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The photograph is horrific. An Indian man in a blood-soaked shirt is standing on a road. Dangling from his hand is a severed head, dripping blood. Staring out from the familiar white and blue frame of a Facebook news feed, the photo's caption says the image is of a Hindu man who beheaded a Muslim politician for raping his sister. It then asks provocatively: \"Does the Hindu deserve punishment?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But something isn't right. The photo is real but the story behind it is completely false, made up in an apparent attempt to stoke religious tensions in a country where such provocations can quickly lead to violence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a busy New Delhi newsroom, on the third floor of a weather-worn building in the Indian capital's business district, Facebook's fight against lies kicks into gear.</p><p>Having been flagged by a fact checker freshly hired by Agence France Presse, the photo is put through a reverse image search.</p><p>Taken six weeks earlier, it actually shows a Hindu man turning himself in to police after murdering another Hindu, who had insulted his mother. Religion had nothing to do with it.</p><p>The fact-check is done by Australian journalist Karl Malakunas and his team at Agence France Presse, which has been hired by Facebook.</p><p>In this instance they limit the damage. The post, which has already been shared hundreds of times across different Facebook groups, including one called \"War Against Paid Media\", is labelled \"false\".</p><p>At this point Facebook intervenes. When a post is confirmed as \"false\" the social media giant removes it or dramatically reduces its distribution in an effort to stop it going viral - something that can happen quickly in India, where the number of active Facebook users is heading toward 300 million, the most of any country. If it is not removed, Facebook adds a pop-up alert so that users who still find the post are prompted to read the fact-checker's report explaining why the claim is wrong.</p><p>Welcome to the frontline of the global battle against fake news.</p><p>Agence France Presse is a French government-owned international news service. Its New Delhi bureau fact-checking operation is just one of dozens that Facebook has started paying for around the world this year.</p><p>It's a fight Mark Zuckerberg and his executive team have come to reluctantly and, some would argue, too late. But with the $US400 billion ($560 billion) company's reputation being battered by growing worldwide concern over manipulation of the truth, it is amassing the troops.</p><p>For Malakunas, who has worked in Asia for 20 years and is a former Manila bureau chief, the work has proved a revelation.</p><p>Establishing operations to investigate dubious news stories, Photoshopped images and inflammatory online posts in Islamabad, Jakarta and Manila has made him look more deeply into what is appearing on social media.</p><p>\"Ahead of the elections it's so important to understand what's happening underneath. It's not just Facebook, but across all social media. This is where the rise of the populists is coming from, and the mainstream media hasn't picked any of them.\"</p><p>To illustrate the point he cites the account of an imposter impersonating a famous Muslim cleric in Indonesia. \"The imposter account has 700,000 followers!\"</p><p>Ultimately, he says, when people are going to the polls and casting their ballots based on false information, it is unequivocally a threat to democracy.</p><p>Over in the Philippines, another AFP fact-checker has called out a post declaring late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos held a Guinness World Record for being the \"Most Brilliant President in History\".</p><p>It would be ridiculous except the post is on a page with nearly 1 million followers that supports Ronald dela Rosa, the Philippines' former police chief who is running for a Senate seat in next year's elections. Along with the Marcos family, dela Rosa is an ally of the country's strongman president Rodrigo Duterte.</p><p>\"Most journalists would snigger and laugh and say, 'As if anyone would believe it',\" says Malakunas. \"But then you see how much traction it gets and the way it can change how people are thinking.</p><p>\"This is a very different way to get people to support a political party than what we are traditionally used to. In an election, we are still focused on what the prime minister and the opposition say. But there is an underworld of cyber-fakery and it is having a significant impact on society. It is shaping views to an extent that I don't think any of us really know.\"</p><p>For years, Zuckerberg played down Facebook's responsibilities in managing content published on the site. People had a right to say things, he would often insist in interviews, even if they were wrong. His mission was to connect people, not to tell them what to share. His focus was on growing the business, which started in a Harvard dorm room almost 15 years ago.</p><p>The way he did this is encapsulated in the company's motto: \"move fast and break things\". While Facebook had basic rules about nudity, hate speech and violence, Zuckerberg was reluctant to interpose a value system on it or be forced into an arbiter-of-truth role.</p><p>And it worked for Facebook if posts were controversial. The business model is built on traffic - the more users there are, the higher the advertising revenue. Sensational tales and eye-catching photos and videos draw people in and keep them engaged on the site for longer.</p><p>But as the number of Facebook's monthly active users rocketed past 2 billion and the company was damaged by a series of scandals - including Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, revelations Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal data of millions of users without their consent and criticism over its failure to stop the spread of hate speech that fuelled the targeting of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar - the management team was forced to change its approach.</p><p>\"Facebook grew really quickly and I don't think they ever stopped to consider the implications of this growth so that now they are absolutely playing catch-up,\" says Jennifer Beckett, a social media and communications expert at the University of Melbourne. \"That's all they can do at this point.\"</p><p>The scale of the challenge is huge. As Beckett points out, every minute on Facebook 510,000 comments are posted and 136,000 photos uploaded. \"This is an immense amount of content that's going up on one platform globally, in multiple languages, in multiple social contexts and multiple political contexts and a lot of it has to be moderated by people because it relies on context and machines don't do context.\"</p><p>Facebook is not alone. Other social media platforms, such as Google, are also being forced to face up to their responsibilities as the power of tech giants in public debates, consumer decision-making and elections becomes ever clearer.</p><p>In Australia, Google will team up with AAP to set up an operation before the NSW state election in March.</p><p>It's a Monday afternoon in Facebook's tech-hip decorated Sydney office and Monika Bickert is apologising for speaking \"a mile a minute\".</p><p>The former US federal criminal prosecutor, who now heads up Facebook's global policy management team and is responsible for policing content on the site, is on a charm offensive. She has a lot to say.</p><p>Bickert is travelling the world to showcase Facebook's efforts to \"create a safe community\" by pulling down images and videos of child abuse and terrorism propaganda and slowing down the distribution of false reports.</p><p>In quick succession, she outlines the steps the company has taken this year: refining its content standards and making those public; improving the technology to find and remove photos; building up a fact-checking network by partnering with traditional news organisations such as AFP and Associated Press; and setting up election \"war rooms\" to ensure the sort of interference that took place in the 2016 US election doesn't happen again. That's important as countries including Indonesia, Australia, India and the Philippines will all hold key elections next year.</p><p>Bickert is a Harvard Law graduate who prior to Facebook worked as a legal adviser in the US embassy in Bangkok with a focus on child exploitation and human trafficking. She says when she started at the company in 2012 there were only a handful of people writing content policies and a couple of hundred content reviewers.</p><p>Those teams have grown to more than 100 and 15,000, respectively. All up, Bickert says there are now 30,000 people working on safety and security at Facebook.</p><p>What she doesn't specify is that much of this growth - an extra 10,000 people - has happened in just the last five months, a tumultuous period for the company, which has been battling to salvage its image as a responsible platform manager and stave off an onslaught of new regulation.</p><p>The new employees - who are in addition to the third-party fact-checkers at organisations such as AFP - are content reviewers, experts in counter terrorism, child safety and domestic violence, engineers, Artificial Intelligence specialists and academics.</p><p>\"What we're fundamentally trying to do with our standards is keep the community safe while also ensuring that people have the ability to express themselves and, for what it's worth, I don't think those things are necessarily at odds with one another,\" says Bickert.</p><p>We are in the meeting room at Facebook's Sydney headquarters, which strives to be unconventional with graffiti art, plant dividers and bike racks on the office floor. There is a Facebook Wall in reception where visitors are invited to write down \"what's on their mind\", a feature in all of its global offices.</p><p>Bickert is explaining what has changed in the content policies and why making them public is important.</p><p>\"Before April, we said with graphic violence if you are sharing content you can do so to raise awareness or condemn violence but we will remove it if you are sharing it to celebrate or glorify violence.</p><p>\"Now, you can see exactly what we mean by extremely violent videos - they include videos of burying bodies or charred bodies, videos of dismemberments; the nitty gritty of exactly how we interpret these things so that people know where the line is.\"</p><p>Those sorts of decisions are made at a fortnightly meeting when about 20 top executives gather around a long table at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California and hook up with offices around the world via video conference.</p><p>At each meeting, they discuss on average two recommendations and another two \"heads up\", which are issues a team flags and then puts together a working group to decide what to do. Bickert holds court at these hour-long sessions, quizzing her team about definitional grey zones, whether Facebook policies line up or differ from government guidelines and how changes might be received by the public.</p><p>The challenging tone of these meetings illustrates just how hard Facebook is finding it to define where the \"line\" actually is, and who should be drawing it.</p><p>Staff question decisions and the processes by which they are made. These include challenging the backgrounds of experts providing input amid concern there is not enough diversity and too many \"white men\" influencing recommendations.</p><p>Others worry about the tough calls that will need to be made based on changes to definitions of child abuse, terrorism propaganda or hate speech.</p><p>In Sydney, Bickert pulls up a complicated \"enforcement\" graphic on a screen at the front of the room - a snapshot of how Facebook is doing - and walks over to point out some statistics, reminding me to move my recorder to pick up what she is saying.</p><p>In the third quarter of this year, Facebook took down or slapped an adult-warning on 30 million pieces of content, including roughly 3 million instances of both terrorism propaganda and hate speech.</p><p>The company also disabled a staggering 754 million fake accounts - most within minutes of registration and many of them set up by robots to scam and spam users.</p><p>\"We contract with third-party intelligence providers who will let us know ISIS have put out a new propaganda video. We can use software to take a digital fingerprint of that video, what we call a hash, and then using that hash we can stop it from ever hitting Facebook,\" says Bickert, stressing how far technology has come in the last few years to detect this type of content.</p><p>\"With terrorism and child exploitation imagery, we're over 99 per cent in terms of how much of that content we flag but it's much harder for hate speech,\" she says, noting the company picks up just over half and the rest is from user reports.</p><p>Tall and confident, with a broad smile and an impressive grasp of the numbers, Bickert is a capable envoy but she is on a tough assignment.</p><p>While the Californian is keen to talk about everything Facebook is proactively doing to clean up its platform, users, journalists, academics and rivals are focused on the company's travails.</p><p>Just five days before AFR Weekend sat down with Bickert in November, The New York Times published an investigation into the use of Facebook in propaganda campaigns. The report claimed security experts at Facebook had known about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election but management delayed telling the board and the public.</p><p>Bickert was also mentioned in the article after being delegated a decision on a Donald Trump post in 2015, along with Facebook's departing head of communications and public policy Elliot Schrage and its vice-president public policy Joel Kaplan. Together, the three executives decided not to suspend Trump's account or remove a post in which he called for a ban on Muslim immigrants after it was flagged by Zuckerberg, who is a Democrat.</p><p>Kaplan, a former George W. Bush staffer, argued it would look like they were obstructing free speech and reportedly said: \"Don't poke the bear.\"</p><p>Bickert explains the contentious decision this way. \"We make clear in the context of immigration, if people are calling for exclusion, we try to create space for that discussion on the site because we know that immigration policy is something that is a regular part of political speech.\"</p><p>It's these sorts of calls for which Facebook finds itself increasingly in hot water. They are complicated and subjective and attract emotional responses from both the right and left of the political spectrum.</p><p>From early on, Facebook has positioned itself as a platform and not a publisher but increasingly it finds itself facing similar challenges to traditional media organisations. That's why its not surprising that Facebook, and also Google, is looking to work with those organisations to help resolve its credibility problem by stemming the flow of false information on its platform.</p><p>\"It's interesting Facebook have come back to the mainstream media organisations for fact-checking and they are paying for it, which puts a value on the work we do and is an acknowledgement of its importance,\" says AFP's Malakunas.</p><p>\"Right now it feels like putting a thumb in the dam wall but more important is the attitude change from big tech. They have been seen as the major problem but they are also the solution.\"</p><p>Malakunas says the way it works is Facebook-affiliated fact-checkers have access to a queue of suspect news flagged by users or uncovered by an algorithm. They can refer to the queue throughout the day and follow-up worthwhile leads - although they are under no obligation to clear the queue - and mark the reports if they are false. Facebook will then dial down the distribution of that post and if readers are still accessing it, direct them to other related news reports.</p><p>AFP uses social media monitoring platforms such as CrowdTangle to find leads and sets up What'sApp channels so that people can report misinformation and disinformation more easily. Increasingly, AFP publishes the fact-checks on its news wire and they are well read.</p><p>But are all of these efforts by Facebook and its fact-checkers enough?</p><p>Melbourne University's Beckett is doubtful. She says the task is too big and the company has a questionable history in acting on reports of misuse. She points to Facebook's slow response to hate speech directed at Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, who suffered violent attacks.</p><p>\"Facebook was warned repeatedly by activists and academics what was happening in Myanmar,\" she says.</p><p>\"It wasn't until the UN stepped in and called the company out that they started to respond. That was either amazing naivety, pure stupidity or just 'we don't care'.\"</p><p>Beckett says, like many people, she was a big believer in social media when it first took off only just over a decade ago.</p><p>It was going to solve the world's problems, give a voice to those without one and connect people around the globe. But she has become more and more sceptical as platforms have been used to spread propaganda. Even Bickert concedes that there is a problem.</p><p>\"We know misinformation has been out there forever but what's different about social media is that it's a unique amplification tool,\" she says.</p><p>\"We are trying to counter that virality and then provide information so that people can make well-informed decisions about what to trust.\"</p><p>That's where fact-checkers such as AFP come in. \"We are starting to work with third-party fact-checking organisations,\" says Bickert. \"This is something we're building out. It's not a complete program.\"</p><p>Not all fact-checkers are happy with Facebook's approach and there have been reports of some smaller partners pulling out. But AFP is backing the initiative and Malakunas says staff are reasonably upbeat about the impact it is having.</p><p>Facebook is currently looking into hiring a third-party fact checker in Australia but does not say whether that arrangement will be in place ahead of the election, which will be held before June next year. Bickert says the biggest issue that comes up in Australia is teenage bullying and Facebook has responded by training digital ambassadors and giving $1 million to Project Rockit, a local group that sends young people out to schools to encourage students to challenge cyberbullying.</p><p>Russell Skelton, who heads a local fact-check unit run jointly by RMIT University and the ABC, says that Australia has fewer fake news websites than other countries because the aim of many sensational reports is to attract people to sites with heavy advertising.</p><p>\"A lot of the fake sites are about generating money. We just don't have enough people to make it financially viable,\" he says.</p><p>\"In countries where there is a strong national broadcaster like the BBC, ABC or Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, there tends to be less of this as people have a reference point to check things.\"</p><p>Skelton says his fact-check unit's remit is to scrutinise statements made by public figures trying to influence the public debate.</p><p>\"When they tell porkies, we target those as a way of improving the discussion around important public policy issues. Then there is fake news, which is like a giant firehose with bots operating on an industrial scale spreading misinformation to millions of people in a matter of minutes. How do you counter that?</p><p>\"I think Facebook and Google absolutely have a responsibility to identify and ping fake news.</p><p>\"We call it misinformation and disinformation because fake news is a term that has been so abused by Trump that it is meaningless now.\"</p><p>Adrian Turner, chief executive of the federal government's data science agency, Data 61, says it's \"an open question whether these companies can get on top of it\".</p><p>He notes the sophistication of some of the voice recognition and lip-syncing tools available to distort photos and create videos. Last year, researchers from the University of Washington made public a disturbing project, in which they collected footage of Barack Obama's lip movements and gestures and used it to make a realistic video of the former president lip-syncing a speech.</p><p>\"If people can't trust a service, they will stop using it,\" says Turner. \"And I think you're already seeing that swing back to trusted news sources like The Australian Financial Review or the Wall Street Journal.\"</p><p>At the same time, Turner says companies such as Facebook exist because there is a need in the marketplace.</p><p>\"I think they'll respond and continue to exist but I also think you will see an emergence of decentralised models.

I take pictures and videos of the kids; I make digital picture shows and movies. With a daughter graduating from middle school this year, my wife recently asked me to make a slideshow with photos of my daughter. My usual method is to use Google Photos, because the fastest way to find photos of my daughter is to search for her face using Google's amazing facial recognition technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facial recognition technology works by employing biometric software to analyze a photo or video in order to create a map of an individual's face, which can then be used to identify that person; however, not all uses of facial recognition software are as innocent as a family slideshow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, facial recognition technology has drawn increasing scrutiny, as foreign governments use facial recognition to track ethnic minorities, large retailers try to mitigate shoplifting, and domestic law enforcement agencies control border access and support criminal investigations.</p><p>As a former military and federal prosecutor, I want law enforcement to have all the tools it needs to keep us safe; however, the primary responsibility of any prosecutor is to pursue justice. When it comes to the use of facial recognition technology, determining what is justified is an evolving consideration. Recent events have heightened the attention on this important technology while also giving regulators and private companies cause for concern.</p><h>NIST Study Causes Concern</h><p>In a study published in December 2019 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), facial technology algorithms were tested on a database of 18 million photos comprised of more than eight million people. Remarkably, the study concluded that Asian, African American and Native American people were up to 100 times more likely to be misidentified by facial recognition than white men. Women were more likely to be falsely identified than men, and the elderly and children were more likely to be misidentified than those in other age groups. Middleaged white men generally benefited from the highest accuracy rates.</p><p>The NIST study corroborated previous studies which also found high error rates; however, the NIST study examined a wide variety of technologies, and not all were beset with such high error rates. Nearly 200 algorithms were voluntarily submitted by nearly 100 private companies, academic institutions and developers. Some had sharply lower error rates, suggesting that bias was not ubiquitous. Also, not every technology was included in the study, because not every developer participated. Amazon's Rekognition technology, for example, was not tested.</p><p>This leaves open the criticism that the NIST study and previous studies are flawed because they used outdated algorithms and/or did not properly deploy the technology. Nevertheless, the prominence of the NIST study prompted concern among regulators and legislators. In the absence of federal regulation, some local municipalities - particularly in California and Massachusetts - banned the use of facial recognition by public officials.</p><p>In February 2020, two U.S. Senators introduced legislation - the Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act - demanding a temporary moratorium on the federal use of facial recognition to protect the privacy of consumers from rapidly advancing facial recognition technology and data collection practices that, according to the sponsors, heighten the risk of over-surveillance and over-policing, particularly in minority communities disproportionately impacted by the technology.</p><p>In addition to halting federal use of facial recognition technology, the legislation would prohibit the use of federal funds to be used by state or local governments for investing in or purchasing the technology.</p><p>The bill includes limited exceptions for law enforcement use of facial recognition pursuant to warrants issued by a court.</p><h>Big Tech Joins In</h><p>Although the federal legislation has since stalled, the recent nationwide protests and the groundswell of support for social justice reform has inspired renewed attention - including from some very powerful forces.</p><p>In early June, IBM, Microsoft and Amazon all announced that they were exiting the facial recognition business or temporarily restricting its use by law enforcement.</p><p>On June 8, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna sent a letter to Congress stating that IBM had discontinued the use of its facial recognition software and opposed the use of the technology for mass surveillance, racial profiling, and other violations of basic human rights and freedoms. IBM called on Congress to adopt a national policy to bring greater transparency and accountability to policing.</p><p>Microsoft made a similar commitment, stating, \"We will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place, grounded in human rights, that will govern this technology.\"</p><p>Similarly, Amazon announced a one-year ban on the use by police of its facial recognition software.</p><h>New York Passes State Surveillance Law</h><p>Within days after the announcements by the big tech companies, the New York City Council passed the Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act (POST Act) on June 18, which requires the NYPD to reveal details on the facial recognition software, cellphone trackers and other surveillance tools it uses to monitor people.</p><p>In particular, the NYPD must: publicly describe its arsenal of surveillance tools; disclose whether a court has authorized it to use them; publicly post on its website rules regarding who can access its surveillance technology; and identify which entities outside the NYPD, including federal authorities, can access the data.</p><p>Notably, the POST Act was first introduced in 2017, but did not gain momentum until the recent nationwide protests.</p><h>Facial Recognition is Not Going Away</h><p>Despite the initiatives by these powerful private and public forces, facial recognition technology is not going away. The big tech companies are not permanently discontinuing the development of these technologies; rather, they are calling on Congress to implement appropriate regulation. In any event, these companies are not the only purveyors of the technology. Other companies will fill the void.</p><p>Discontinuing the use of facial recognition by federal law enforcement agencies, such as the DEA and ICE, will be a challenge (and perhaps unwise). Congress must also balance any regulatory initiatives prompted by recent events with the critical goal of maintaining law and order and combating terrorism.</p><p>For example, the 2005 REAL ID Act (anticipated to be fully implemented in 2021) requires all U.S. states and territories to verify that individuals have only one government-issued license. Rooted as a response to the events of 9/11, this is a task predicated on collecting and sharing biometrics, including facial recognition data. The requirements of that law cannot readily be met without the robust use of facial recognition technology.</p><p>Even amidst a global pandemic, researchers are crawling the internet for photos of people wearing face masks to improve facial recognition algorithms. So, yes, the technology will continue to evolve and continue to be used. The issue is what role will Congress play, how will bias be mitigated, and can we balance the goals of law enforcement and public safety with the rights of all of our citizens.</p><p>Meanwhile, as this issue is debated, I will still be making those picture slideshows of my kids - putting facial recognition to use to commemorate the important events of my life. If only all such uses of the technology were as easy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SECDEA-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SECDEA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-MJD1-DYPC-300D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293694</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cygnus Business Media, Inc.

Over a weekend, he created \"Image Scrubber\", a free programme that blurs faces in digital photos.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a tool for anonymising photographs taken at protests,\" he said, before adding: \"A one-page website is a paper-thin shield against a surveillance state.\"</p><p>Facial recognition software has been quietly rolled out by border agencies and police forces worldwide. Scotland Yard introduced it in January, a move that campaign group Big Brother Watch said was \"a serious threat to civil liberties in the UK\".</p><p>The Black Lives Matter marches have brought to the fore concerns about how the technology is developed and used - and by whom. It appears to have pushed the industry's leaders into doing something they had previously resisted: pausing, and letting the rules catch up. At least, that is what the big players said last week.</p><p>IBM announced it was closing its facial recognition operation. Amazon said it would stop selling its Rekognition system to the police for a year to \"give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules\". Microsoft followed suit, urging Congress to pass rules that were \"grounded in human rights\".</p><p>Critics argue that the technology, which can potentially identify anyone, anywhere, by image alone, is tantamount to the death of privacy and a trampling of civil rights. Yet many viewed last week's eruption of conscience as a PR move by industry giants seeking to position themselves for the dawn of a technology that will reshape society. \"This is one of those situations where the government will not be able to resist weaponising the technology against its people,\" said Eric Goldman, co-director of the High Tech Law Institute of Santa Clara University.</p><p>Companies have created hundreds of facial recognition systems in recent years. Their accuracy has, broadly, come on in leaps and bounds. America's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) this year analysed 189 algorithms created by 99 companies and universities. It found the top five were able to pluck photos from a database of millions to match a chosen picture with 99.9% accuracy - far better than humans can do.</p><p>The technology has galloped ahead of regulation. Companies such as Amazon and Clearview AI, a controversial start-up that claims its system is used by more than 600 police departments, have marketed systems as surveillance tools for authorities and retail chains. Yet the sector is peppered with systems that can spit out inaccurate results or exacerbate racial and gender biases.</p><p>NIST noted the worst algorithms generated up to 100 times as many \"false positives\" as the best. This presented \"privacy and civil rights and civil liberties concerns such as when matches result in additional questioning, surveillance, errors in benefit adjudication, or loss of liberty\".</p><p>The danger is that the technology inspires almost blind faith despite its limitations, said Rashida Richardson at the AI Now Institute in New York:\"The main problem is it doesn't work as well as most people think it does. I don't know of any other industry where we allow for real-time experimentation on humans, which essentially is what's happening with facial recognition.\"</p><p>A 2018 study by the MIT Media Lab found algorithms marketed as almost 100% accurate worked well on pictures of white men, but were wrong in a third of the cases involving black women. The discrepancies were probably caused by training data that used photographs of mostly white faces.</p><p>Clearview AI was thrust into the spotlight in January after The New York Times revealed that the small, private company backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, \"scraped\" more than three billion pictures from the likes of Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and other public sites to create a database.</p><p>It sold the system to police departments, allowing them to cross-reference crime photos with the database to track down suspects. Several sites served Clearview with cease-and desist orders to stop it copying photos.</p><p>Recent events appear to have increased the urgency to put up guardrails around the technology. Congress included limits to its use by police in a bill proposed last week.</p><p>Goldman urged caution about Big Tech's sudden push for new rules, pointing to a long history where incumbents \"weaponised\" regulation to make it harder for smaller rivals to compete.</p><p>Some cities, such as San Francisco, have already banned its use by police. Richardson said: \"It may be practically difficult to stop a technology already pervasively used, but it's not impossible. It takes will and strategy.\"</p><p>Beyond the practical concerns, there is also a visceral element behind the backlash. A tech executive at one company that has considered developing its own system declined to do so because of what he called the \"creepiness factor\".</p><p>He said: \"When you start to talk about the ubiquitous capability to identify people using technical means across all of their movement, it cuts across the reasonable expectation of privacy in public spaces.\"</p><p>A regulatory reckoning for facial recognition may be long overdue, but the outcome is far from certain. Pipkin said: \"One company's refusal to build a technology is an ultimately positive step, but it is a temporary one that can be undone by a government project or a different company picking up where they left off.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Rashida Richardson of the AI Now Institute: the technology 'doesn't work as well as people think it does'</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-160729639</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604F-3KY1-DYTY-C51K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 14, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

And he's chosen to build facial recognition software for law enforcement with that data.<br/>Clearview AI, formerly known as Smartcheckr, wasn't originally founded to service the law enforcement community. It apparently hoped to enter the retail space first, but ethical concerns lead companies to shy away from Clearview's products.<br/>Today Clearview claims it works with more than 600 law enforcement agencies, but that number may not hold up under scrutiny.<br/>A recent investigation from Buzzfeed's Ryan Mac, Caroline Haskins, and Logan McDonald unveiled a litany of lies, misinformation, and attempted cover-ups by the company's CEO and current and former employees. This includes falsely reporting their products aided in the capture of a terrorist, and the company CEO deleting much of his social media and online history in an obvious attempt to cover up links between himself and the white supremacist movement.<br/>At one point Douglass Mackey, the person known as alt-right provocateur and anti-semite personality \"Ricky Vaughn,\" was an employee of Smartcheckr, though Ton-That claims he was only a contractor for a short period of time.<br/>Clearview AI, as Smartcheckr, was co-founded by Richard Swartz. Swartz is a former aid to President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Guliani. Ton-That and Swartz reportedly met at the Manhattan Institute, an extremely Conservative think-tank.<br/>And, rounding things out, once the company pivoted to working with law enforcement, it received early funding from Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and a personal friend of the President.<br/>During the early days of the company, Ton-That was also linked to numerous other alt-right and white supremacist figures including Mike Cernovich, Chuck Johnson, and Paul Nehlen.<br/>Prior to running an\u00a0AI company dedicated to serving the law enforcement community, Ton-That was a small-time hacker who created computer worms and email viruses. He eventually went to work for AngelList before founding his own company in 2016.<br/>Clearview's most recent controversy stems from the numerous lawsuits it faces from Google/YouTube, Twitter, and other sites that it's scraped data from. Ton-That's company claims to have billions of images of our faces and it gets them by using software to grab every picture it can find on the internet.<br/>If you're thinking \"I don't post pictures on Facebook, so I'm good\" you're dead-wrong. These aren't just images you've chosen to make public, they're also pulled from Google Image searches and anywhere else Clearview can find images. And, since they aren't asking anyone's permission, there's no limit on what they can use. If anyone has ever posted a picture of you online - whether a former school or employer, a spiteful ex, or your loving grandma - you're probably in this company's database.<br/>And you can't opt out. Per Kashmir Hill's New York Times article exposing Ton-That and Clearview AI, the company is working on a process by which users may eventually request their data be removed, but there are no laws or regulations requiring such concessions be made in the US.<br/>Clearview AI's ties to white supremacists coupled with the absolute fact that facial recognition software has been proven time and time again to have inherent bias against persons of color is a red flag in and of itself. However, there's plenty more to be wary of.<br/>The company claims its facial recognition software is 99.6 percent accurate, but it won't reveal exactly how it arrives at that number. For perspective, state-of-the-art facial recognition software by big tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Google doesn't achieve that level of accuracy in the wild unless you severely limit the threshold for recognition. In other words: It's highly likely that the 99.6 percent accuracy claim is based on identifying well-lit pictures of white men who post a lot of selfies.<br/>There's also the litany of times the company was caught lying about the number of law enforcement agencies it was partnered with. Buzzfeed reports that, in numerous instances, Clearview claims it worked with police when, in fact, it merely submitted tips via a crime hotline.<br/>It's obvious that Ton-That and Clearview operate on a foundation of fast-talking and hyperbole, but the CEO's claim that the First Amendment of the US Constitution gives his company the right to scrape data is perhaps his most ridiculous.<br/>Companies don't have rights under the US Constitution, only humans do. In a previous case where Microsoft/LinkedIn sued startup data scraping company HiQ, judges ruled in favor of HiQ but declined to opine on any First Amendment issues as they didn't consider it relevant. Clearview may find the courts weigh its situation differently than HiQ's based on the public view.<br/>At the end of the day, Ton-That and Clearview AI are the ones that represent a potential\u00a0threat to our First Amendment rights. His company gives law enforcement officers an ubiquitous facial recognition system that allows them to track and identify anyone in the country.<br/>Our right to demonstrate peacefully in the US is potentially under assault. That a company with direct ties to white supremacists is providing demonstrably biased software to the law enforcement community should concern all of us.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-597630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y55-GT31-JBYT-H1WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ton-That's argument is that, as US citizen, he has the right to do whatever he wants with any data that's publicly available online. And he's chosen to build facial recognition software for law enforcement with that data. Clearview AI, formerly known as Smartcheckr, wasn't originally founded to service the law enforcement community. </p><p>It apparently hoped to enter the retail space first, but ethical concerns lead companies to shy away from Clearview's products. Today Clearview claims it works with more than 600 law enforcement agencies, but that number may not hold up under scrutiny. A recent investigation[3] from Buzzfeed's Ryan Mac, Caroline Haskins, and Logan McDonald unveiled a litany of lies, misinformation, and attempted cover-ups by the company's CEO and current and former employees. This includes falsely reporting their products aided in the capture of a terrorist, and the company CEO deleting much of his social media and online history in an obvious attempt to cover up links between himself and the white supremacist movement. At one point Douglass Mackey, the person known as alt-right provocateur and anti-semite personality #8216;Ricky Vaughn,#8217;[4] was an employee of Smartcheckr, though Ton-That claims he was only a contractor for a short period of time. Clearview AI, as Smartcheckr, was co-founded by Richard Swartz. Swartz is a former aid to President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Guliani. Ton-That and Swartz reportedly met at the Manhattan Institute, an extremely Conservative think-tank. And, rounding things out, once the company pivoted to working with law enforcement, it received early funding from Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and a personal friend of the President. During the early days of the company, Ton-That was also linked to numerous other alt-right and white supremacist figures including Mike Cernovich, Chuck Johnson, and Paul Nehlen. Prior to running anAI company dedicated to serving the law enforcement community, Ton-That was a small-time hacker who created computer worms and email viruses. He eventually went to work for AngelList before founding his own company in 2016. Clearview's most recent controversy stems from the numerous lawsuits it faces from Google/YouTube[5], Twitter[6], and other sites that it's scraped data from. Ton-That's company claims to have billions of images of our faces and it gets them by using software to grab every picture it can find on the internet. If you're thinking #8216;I don't post pictures on Facebook, so I'm good#8217; you're dead-wrong. These aren't just images you've chosen to make public, they're also pulled from Google Image searches and anywhere else Clearview can find images. And, since they aren't asking anyone's permission, there's no limit on what they can use. If anyone has ever posted a picture of you online #8212; whether a former school or employer, a spiteful ex, or your loving grandma #8212; you're probably in this company's database. And you can't opt out. Per Kashmir Hill's New York Times article[7] exposing Ton-That and Clearview AI, the company is working on a process by which users may eventually request their data be removed, but there are no laws or regulations requiring such concessions be made in the US. Clearview AI's ties to white supremacists coupled with the absolute fact that facial recognition software has been proven time and time again to have inherent bias against persons of color is a red flag in and of itself. However, there's plenty more to be wary of. The company claims its facial recognition software is 99.6 percent accurate, but it won't reveal exactly how it arrives at that number. For perspective, state-of-the-art facial recognition software by big tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Google doesn't achieve that level of accuracy[8] in the wild unless you severely limit the threshold for recognition. In other words: It's highly likely that the 99.6 percent accuracy claim is based on identifying well-lit pictures of white men who post a lot of selfies. There's also the litany of times the company was caught lying about the number of law enforcement agencies it was partnered with. Buzzfeed reports[9] that, in numerous instances, Clearview claims it worked with police when, in fact, it merely submitted tips via a crime hotline. It's obvious that Ton-That and Clearview operate on a foundation of fast-talking and hyperbole, but the CEO's claim that the First Amendment of the US Constitution gives his company the right to scrape data is perhaps his most ridiculous. Companies don't have rights under the US Constitution, only humans do. In a previous case[10] where Microsoft/LinkedIn sued startup data scraping company HiQ, judges ruled in favor of HiQ but declined to opine on any First Amendment issues as they didn't consider it relevant. Clearview may find the courts weigh its situation differently than HiQ's based on the public view. At the end of the day, Ton-That and Clearview AI are the ones that represent a potentialthreat to our First Amendment rights. His company gives law enforcement officers an ubiquitous facial recognition system that allows them to track and identify anyone in the country. Our right to demonstrate peacefully in the US is potentially under assault. That a company with direct ties to white supremacists is providing demonstrably biased software to the law enforcement community should concern all of us.

The new program, which must have been assembled from George Orwell's apparent instruction manual 1984[2], is slowly rolling out throughout China in several cities, The Standard reported.[3] In Shenzhen, China, home of OnePlus, Huawei and internet giant Tencent, the city has released a new government system for elderly Chinese. This new program will allow residents of China over the age of 60 to register for free subway rides, using just their face as their ticket. </p><p>If you think this is just a one-off, you would be utterly wrong. This form of facial recognition is already being experimented in other cities including Jinan, Shanghai and Nanjing according to the South China Morning Post[4]. China isplanning[5]to merge its170+ million security cameras with artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to create a mega-surveillance state. This compounds with China's'social credit system'that ranks citizens based on their behavior, and rewards and punishes depending on those scores. The effort of using facial recognition as a ticket \u2014 especially as an incentive \u2014 is spreading across the world, starting with entertainment concert venues which Fight For The Future and dozens of artists strongly oppose as Activist Post reported.[6] That's not all \u2014 even retail is pushing to forcefully indoctrinate society to use facial recognition technology as an anti-theft mechanism to be introduced in a thousands of stores using biometric software FaceFirst to build a database of shoplifters, as Activist Postreported[7]. Lately, BIG brother has been pushing the use of surveillance technology, from Amazonhelping[8]law enforcement with itsFacial Rekogntion[9]software, DHS wanting to use it forborder control[10], to theOlympics[11]wanting to use the tech for security. Further, some of the biggest airports[12] in the U.S. \u2014 estimated at 16 airports across the nation \u2014 are now scanning us as we board international flights. CBP (Customs And Border Patrol) expects[13]to scale up the program to cover more than 97 percent of passengers flying outside of the U.S. by 2021according[14]toNextGov. It's all a part of U.S. President Donald Trump's 'Biometric Exit' agenda, which was originally signed into law[15]under the Obama administration,BuzzFeed Newsreported[16]. Further, the policy director of U.S. CBP believes that facial recognition has alreadybecome essential[17]. The agency's head Deputy Executive Assistant Commissioner John Wagner has also hilariously said that its facial tracking technology isn't surveillance, asActivist Postreported.[18] In 2017, Homeland Security clarified their position on domestic spying stating that Americans who don't want their faces scanned leaving the country 'shouldn't travel.' 'The only way for an individual to ensure he or she is not subject to collection of biometric information when traveling internationally is to refrain from traveling,' the DHS wrote in adocument[19]. This nightmarish reality if it comes to fruition will see everyone scrutinized and their bio identics in numerous government databases. This would allow anyone access to our biometrics at any single point in time, whether that's our fingerprints, face, voice, or financial purchases for advertisers. If that wasn't bad enough, Chinese scientists have recently developed an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled 500 megapixel cloud camera that's capable of panoramic capture of an entire stadium with the ability to target a single individual in an instant, Global Times reported.[20] The upgrade to facial recognition technology is developed by Shanghai-based Fudan University and Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanics and Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun, capital of Northeast China's Jilin Province. Fudan University and Changchun Institute of Optics aren't the first researchers to advance facial recognition. There is also Shanghai-based YITU Technology which has evolved the facial recognition industry by being able to identify a person within a matter of seconds from a database of people, even if only their partial face is visible, CNBC reported.[21] The evolution of facial recognition technology is further documented by researchers at the University of Bradford have found that 'facial recognition technology works even when only half a face is visible,'according[22]toEurekAlert. Although, this upgraded technology hasn't been tested by police to this writer's knowledge, and let's hope that it never is, for if it does civil liberties and privacy will cease to exist. If Americans aren't careful we will soon have the same surveillance state and facial recognition dystopia that Chinese citizens now have in 2019. Already, facial recognition cameras are being suggested to be installed in subways, trains and bus stations like recently in New York. Earlier this year, the head of the MTA's finance committee, Larry Schwartz, called[23] for the installation of surveillance cameras and facial recognition technology to catch and deter criminals. Although, the Chinese have gotten a head start on everyone with their social credit program that is already being flaunted in the U.S. and its world-famous Chinese Firewall preventing its populace from speaking out, arresting dissidents, imprisoning[24] Muslim Uygurs aided by big tech like Google. Privacy advocate groups, attorneys, and even morerecently[25]Microsoft, which alsomarketsits ownfacial recognition system[26], have all raised concerns over the technology, pointing to issues of consent,racial profiling[27], and the potential to use images gathered through facial recognition cameras as evidence of criminal guilt by law enforcement.'We don't want to live in a world where government bureaucrats can enter in your name into a database and get a record of where you've been and what your financial, political, sexual, and medical associations and activities are,' Jay Stanley, an attorney with ACLU, told BuzzFeed News about the use of facial recognition cameras in retail stores. 'And we don't want a world in which people are being stopped and hassled by authorities because they bear resemblance to some scary character.' Meanwhile in the UK, YouGov carried out Britain's first national survey[28] on public opinion regarding the use of facial recognition tech by the Ada Lovelace Institute. The institute found that, out of 4,109 adults aged over 16 questioned on the opinions of the technology \u2014 a massive 55 percent said they wanted the UK government to impose restrictions on the tech. In addition, a 46 percent of respondents said they want the right to opt-out of the use of facial recognition technology and 61 percent of people opposed the use of facial recognition tech on public transport. On the other side of the hemisphere, another national survey[29] in the U.S. of 3,151 U.S. adults in December take by theCenter for Data Innovation[30], found only one in four Americans believe the federal government should strictly limit the use of facial recognition biometrics technology. The survey also indicated Americans are more likely to support a trade-off to their own privacy caused by biometric technology if it benefits law enforcement, reduces shoplifting or speeds up airport security lines. Only 18 percent of those polled stated they agreed with strict limitations on facial recognition tech if it comes at the expense of public safety, compared to 55 percent who disagreed with such limitations. However, apoll[31]from theBrookings Institution in September 2018 contradicts that and found half of Americans favored limitations of the use of facial recognition by law enforcement, while 42 percent felt it invaded personal privacy rights. There is still hope for Americans with Congressmen being opposed to the use of the technology and calling for a 'halt' of its deployment. However, despite Congressional hearings on the matter police departments across the U.S. like Detroit have decided to go forward with a facial recognition program for police. The program has already drawn severe blowback with activists protesting the decision. Already, we have had several wins in this long fight and there are signs of hope. First, San Franciscobanned[32]facial recognition technology being used by the government in May of this year, then Somerville, Massachusetts, and Oakland, Californiafollowed[33]suit. The rapid growth of this technology has triggered a much-needed debate to slow down the roll out.Activists[34],politicians[35],academics[36]and evenpolice forces[37] all over the world are expressing serious concerns over the impact facial recognition could have on our society. Several lawmakers have even chimed in to voice concerns about Amazon's facial recognition software, expressing worry that it could be misused,The Hillreported[38]. A Senatebill[39]introduced in March would force companies who want to use facial recognition technology on consumers to first get their consent. If that happens as soon as the ink is dry Amazon's Ring and Amazon's Facial Rekognition which heavily relies on facial recognition technology could be banned across the U.S. Congress under the House Oversight Committee recentlyheld[40]a bipartisan discussion on the issue of regulating the use of facial recognition technology and biometric cameras. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.)said[41],'there are virtually no controls . Whatever walk of life you come from, you may be a part of this [surveillance] process.' The committee's top Republican Rep.Jim Jordan (R-Ohio.) alsoexpressed[42]'It's time for a time out' on government use of the surveillance technology. Fight For The Future has previously launched afirst-of-its-kind interactive map[43]that tracks where in the U.S. facial recognition technology is being used and where it is being resisted, along with a tool-kit for local activists who want to help kickstart a ban in their city or state, asActivist Postreported.[44] Consent to be identified by the government whenever and wherever we go is approval to have the government decide whether, when, and where we are allowed to travel like China. Making our faces be our travel card is put bluntly: a very dangerous precedent to allow. We can't change our facial structures, all of a sudden you could find yourself being blocked from services just because the government doesn't like you or your politics. For more on facial recognition technology and what's to come for our future, see this writer's previous article'The Rise Of Facial Recognition Technology Is Now Inevitable.'[45] If all else fails, I suppose we could all use anti-facial recognition lasers[46] like the protesters in Hong Kong did to disrupt the systems. At least until the artificial intelligence evolves to the point which even George Orwell couldn't have imagined.Aaron Kesel writes for Activist Post. Support us at Patreon[47].

Privacy watchers worry, even more so than is already the case.</p><p>But, just as all manner of companies and entities that hoover up peoples\u2019 data are now facing a growing backlash, such developments \u2013 and the facial-recognition technology fuelling them \u2013 are likely to provoke a similar reckoning in one form or another.</p><p>In China\u2019s case, police recently began using the sunglasses at the Zhengzhou East high-speed rail station in Henan province. In a short period of time they were able to identify seven fugitives in hit-and-run and human-trafficking cases and 26 cases of identity fraud, according to the South China Morning Post.</p><p>It\u2019s not just China. Law enforcement in many countries is increasingly becoming enamoured with the real-time ability to identify individuals and match their images with database information.</p><p>The UAE, for one, is adding tens of thousands of cameras across Dubai ahead of Expo 2020. Authorities expect the technology will help them fend off and prevent everything from serious crimes to minor traffic violations.</p><p>Tech companies are getting on board too, with varying degrees of privacy sensitivity. Facebook, for example, last year expanded its ability to detect users in posted photos that they had not been explicitly tagged in.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, put facial recognition front and centre in the iPhone X, making it the main method with which users unlock the device.</p><p>In both cases, the companies say the capabilities are purely voluntary. Apple went a step further, saying that any facial data gleaned from users stays strictly on the devices and is never uploaded to any server.</p><p>Amazon\u2019s recently opened cashier-less store in Seattle also tracks customers with dozens of cameras, but the company \u2013 cognizant of the potential privacy backlash \u2013 says it isn\u2019t using facial recognition.</p><p>_______</p><p>Instead, the multitude of cameras track and identify buyers as they move through the store without resorting to a stored database. It\u2019s similar, but a little less worrisome since it doesn\u2019t match images with pre-stored information. Also, anyone entering the store is doing so voluntarily.</p><p>All in all, facial recognition technology is expected to experience robust growth over the next few years, with law enforcement acting as the biggest buyer. The global market will grow nearly 14 per cent annually to US$7.7 billion by 2022, from $4bn last year, according to analysis firm Report Linker.</p><p>There are obvious societal benefits, as the Chinese results have highlighted. Facial recognition can be used to pick the proverbial needle out of a haystack and, when coupled with artificial intelligence, it can potentially help prevent crimes before they happen.</p><p>Those same capabilities, however, are provoking a host of concerns \u2013 perhaps more so than with other forms of data collection because of the potential for errors. And, unlike using Facebook or an iPhone, people can be subjected to the technology without knowledge or consent.</p><p>A 2016 study by the US-based Georgetown Law Centre for Privacy and Technology found that more than half of Americans already had their image stored in a facial recognition network. Such databases were being readily shared with law enforcement agencies.</p><p>Researchers, however, pointed out that facial recognition, at least in the US, is almost completely unregulated, prompting privacy advocates to call for greater transparency and official oversight of the technology.</p><p>Law enforcement and possibly governments will certainly fight such moves and in places like China, such movements are likely to be non-starters. The market for anti-surveillance measures, on the other hand, is likely to grow as well.</p><p>For $22, a Czech Republic-based company will sell a \u201cJustice Cap\u201d, a simple baseball hat equipped with infrared LED lights in the brim. The hat effectively blinds surveillance cameras by obscuring the wearer\u2019s face with a bright IR flash.</p><p>Berlin-based artist and technologist Adam Harvey, meanwhile, is working on something he calls Hyperface, a printed pattern that can be applied to clothing and textiles. The pattern appears to have many eyes, noses and other facial features, which can introduce indiscernible noise and confuse facial-recognition software.</p><p>Authorities may try to restrict or even outlaw such measures, similar to how some municipalities have made it illegal to use jamming devices to foil red-light traffic cameras. But it\u2019s easy to see a veritable arms race developing between the two sides. Sooner or later, a big tech company is going to make anti-surveillance a selling point.</p><p>The market for anti-drone technology \u2013 lasers and electronics designed to detect and fool unmanned vehicles \u2013 has already established itself. Analysis firm Markets and Markets expects 25 per cent annual growth to $1.5bn by 2023.</p><p>If governments don\u2019t offer citizens privacy rights or are slow to re-assert them, this arms race \u2013 or rather face race \u2013 is sure to escalate.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/40/151845152907.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/40/151845152907.jpg</url></p><p>A police officer wearing a pair of smartglasses with a facial recognition system at Zhengzhou East Railway Station in Zhengzhou in China's central Henan province.

More and more companies, including major employers like Hilton and Unilever, are using facial recognition technology to make hiring decisions[3]. Their systems grade your facial movements to generate a pseudoscientific 'employability' score that can determine if you get the job.It's not just employers using this technology. Banks and insurers[4] are rolling out these facial recognition systems to determine how much you pay for health insurance or if you qualify for a loan. </p><p>Banks claim their face scans can determine honesty and trustworthiness by scanning for 'suspicious' facial expressions.Meanwhile health insurers are using their facial recognition tools to charge overweight customers higher premiums. Researchers call these technologies 'digital snake oil[5]' and a 'license to discriminate' because there's no scientific evidence that facial expressions can predict job performance, health or creditworthiness.What's more, these systems can penalize people who are from different cultures, or are simply nervous about having their face scanned and judged by an algorithm.The regulations in AB 2261, which is up for consideration by the Assembly Appropriations Committee this week, are mere formalities that tech and surveillance companies can easily bypass.If this bill passes, these companies will see this law as an invitation to stay the course. They will keep building and selling facial recognition systems to our detriment. They will double-down on their plans for a future in which facial recognition technology can hold sway over critical decisions that shape our lives - including whether we're turned down for jobs, denied loans, faced with unnecessary legal fees, charged more for insurance, and even excluded from businesses and essential services.Californians are facing huge economic losses right now. As counties begin to reopen, lawmakers must address the economic strain the COVID19 pandemic has put on our communities and the growing financial crisis their constituents have had to endure. Lawmakers must prioritize legislation that protects their ability to recover financially, not bills that allow massive corporations to deploy barriers to employment and financial stability.While we work to recover from layoffs, interrupted work schedules and lost income, AB 2261 would allow companies to push harmful technologies deeper into our lives without ensuring that they even work properly.This bill does not require facial recognition companies to actually test if their systems are accurate and fair - instead passing that responsibility to unspecified 'third parties.' We need much more than these flimsy protections as facial recognition technology increasingly acts as a gatekeeper to jobs, health care and economic opportunity.In a moment when so many of us are struggling, economic discrimination via facial surveillance is the last thing we need. Our legislators should vote no on AB 2261._____Vinhcent Le is a Technology Equity Attorney at the Greenlining Institute, [emailprotected][6]. He wrote this commentary for CalMatters.

More and more companies, including major employers like Hilton and Unilever, are using facial recognition technology to make hiring decisions. Their systems grade your facial movements to generate a pseudoscientific \"employability\" score that can determine if you get the job.</p><p> It's not just employers using this technology. Banks and insurers are rolling out these facial recognition systems to determine how much you pay for health insurance or if you qualify for a loan. Banks claim their face scans can determine honesty and trustworthiness by scanning for \"suspicious\" facial expressions.</p><p> Meanwhile health insurers are using their facial recognition tools to charge overweight customers higher premiums. Researchers call these technologies \"digital snake oil\" and a \"license to discriminate\" because there's no scientific evidence that facial expressions can predict job performance, health or creditworthiness.</p><p> What's more, these systems can penalize people who are from different cultures, or are simply nervous about having their face scanned and judged by an algorithm.</p><p> The regulations in AB 2261, which is up for consideration by the Assembly Appropriations Committee this week, are mere formalities that tech and surveillance companies can easily bypass.</p><p> If this bill passes, these companies will see this law as an invitation to stay the course. They will keep building and selling facial recognition systems to our detriment. They will double-down on their plans for a future in which facial recognition technology can hold sway over critical decisions that shape our lives \u2013 including whether we're turned down for jobs, denied loans, faced with unnecessary legal fees, charged more for insurance, and even excluded from businesses and essential services.</p><p> Californians are facing huge economic losses right now. As counties begin to reopen, lawmakers must address the economic strain the COVID19 pandemic has put on our communities and the growing financial crisis their constituents have had to endure. Lawmakers must prioritize legislation that protects their ability to recover financially, not bills that allow massive corporations to deploy barriers to employment and financial stability.</p><p> While we work to recover from layoffs, interrupted work schedules and lost income, AB 2261 would allow companies to push harmful technologies deeper into our lives without ensuring that they even work properly.</p><p> This bill does not require facial recognition companies to actually test if their systems are accurate and fair \u2013 instead passing that responsibility to unspecified \"third parties.\" We need much more than these flimsy protections as facial recognition technology increasingly acts as a gatekeeper to jobs, health care and economic opportunity.</p><p> In a moment when so many of us are struggling, economic discrimination via facial surveillance is the last thing we need.

But in recent months, as Congress considered regulation of one of the most controversial topics it faces \u2014 how, when, or if to use facial recognition \u2014 we've gotten glimpses of a political unicorn[1]. In two House Oversight and Reform committee hearings last summer, some of the most prominent Republicans and Democrats in the United States Congress joined together in calls for legislative reform. Proponents of regulation ranged from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to Rep. </p><p>Jim Jordan (R-OH), a frequent Trump supporter on cable news. On Friday, Jordan was also appointed to the House Intelligence Committee[2] to confront witnesses in public presidential impeachment hearings that begin this week. On the subject of facial recognition regulation, the House initiated hearings because of potential First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment questions raised by the technology. Calls for such hearings arose from a perceived lack of oversight on the part of law enforcement agencies like the FBI, as well as the technology's track record of performing poorly on women and people with dark skin tones compared with white men, according to an April report[3] from the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and multiple audits[4]. Committee chair Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Jordan \u2014 two of the best-known members of their respective parties \u2014 were in the process of drafting a bill, Vox reported this summer[5], but that did not come to pass. Cummings passed away on October 17. Before he died, Cummings called the hearings a demonstration of significant bipartisan concern about the use of facial recognition 'by our government against our people without adequate safeguards.' 'I believe there should be front-end accountability for law enforcement's use of facial recognition technology. I also believe that people should be informed of their participation in a facial recognition technology system and should be able to 'opt-in' when possible,' Cummings said in a statement provided to VentureBeat for this story before his passing. 'This technology is evolving extremely rapidly, without any [real] safeguards, whether we are talking about commercial use or government use. There are real concerns about the risks that this technology poses to our civil rights and liberties, and our right to privacy.' The committee's work followed the introduction of the Commercial Facial Recognition Privacy Act of 2019[6], which would require businesses to receive consent before using facial recognition software. It was introduced by Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Brian Schatz (D-HI). Lawmakers in democratic societies around the world are scrambling to decide when and where such protections should be applied. Standards and models for how to treat facial recognition technology are popping up in multiple countries and with varying results. France and India are creating national facial recognition databases, China leans toward dystopian deployment in subways and crosswalks, and the European Commissioner reportedly plans to introduce a facial recognition law in line with existing major privacy protections.Facial regulation's left-leaning rootsIn Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed interest in regulating facial recognition. But on a local level, efforts to regulate governmental use of facial recognition have been led by left-leaning municipalities. Cities like San Francisco and New York, and state legislatures in Michigan and New Jersey[7], have been among the first to tackle the subject. This fall, California passed a three-year moratorium on facial recognition use in law enforcement body cameras. Conversation in these cases tends to vacillate between the need for a temporary moratorium and a permanent ban[8]. In May, San Francisco became the first to ban facial recognition use by police[9] or city departments as part of a broader bill that creates a process for review of government surveillance technology. In June, Somerville, Massachusetts (near Harvard University and Boston) passed a similar ban, and in July, Oakland, California passed one as well. More recently, Berkeley, California passed a facial recognition ban, and Springfield, Massachusetts has considered one. Ethicists and privacy activists like Oakland lawyer Brian Hofer favor an outright ban. Hofer helped coauthor legislation in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley and finds facial recognition to be an irredeemable technology[10]. 'I believe strongly that the technology will get more accurate, and that's my greater concern, that it will be perfect surveillance,' he said. 'It'll be a level of intrusiveness that we never consented to the government having. It's just too radical of an expansion of their power, and I don't think walking around in my daily life that I should have to subject myself to mass surveillance.' Others, like Clare Garvie, believe a moratorium is appropriate to give communities time to consider regulation. A senior associate at the Georgetown University Center on Privacy and Technology, Garvie testified before Congress about facial recognition earlier this year. Garvie works as part of the Perpetual Lineup project to document facial recognition use by local law enforcement. In its documentation in recent years, the project found virtually no oversight or standardization of facial recognition use by police across the U.S. Its most recent assessment last spring found that some departments use composite sketches or partial images to identify suspects with facial recognition \u2014 methods that can produce highly inaccurate results. Records obtained by the project found attempts by the NYPD to run a picture of actor Woody Harrelson through a facial recognition system[11] because officers thought the suspect seen in drug store camera footage resembled the actor. Before a moratorium is lifted, Garvie said she wants to see minimum photo quality standards, accuracy testing, and publicly available reports \u2014 like the kind mandated in San Francisco's law \u2014 on how the government uses facial recognition tech.The effect of proximity to tech centersWe don't yet know much about people's attitudes toward facial recognition and the extent to which it breaks down along partisan lines, but recent polls have shed some light on the matter. A Pew Research survey[12] released in September offered one of the first glimpses into it. The survey of 4,000 U.S. adults found that 65% of Republicans trust police with facial recognition, compared to 51% of Democrats. Brooks Rainwater is director of the Center for City Solutions at the National League of Cities and is following the growing trend of facial recognition adoption by local governments. Cities exploring facial recognition regulation are almost all in blue parts of the country thus far, like New York, where a bill is being considered to regulate business use of the technology and ensure landlords don't replace physical keys with facial recognition[13], and in Portland, where city officials are considering a ban on private sector use of facial recognition. Rainwater thinks local governments have been first to act because they're able to pass legislation more quickly than Congress, but lawmakers at the regional and state levels are also grappling with how and when this technology should be used. Democrats and Republicans may approach facial recognition in different ways, but there's concern on both sides, Rainwater noted. He said the fact that 'dark blue' cities are the first to legislate facial recognition policy in the U.S. is likely a reflection of those cities' proximity to the tech industry. 'I don't think it's necessarily that [partisan] dynamic so much as cities that are on the bleeding edge from a technology perspective,' he said. 'These are areas that are very well-versed in technology and its implications, and so the councilmembers, the mayors \u2014 all of them are very much invested in the larger technology conversation happening within cities.' The fact that surveillance camera networks are also largest in cities, according to Comparitech analysis[14], may be another factor. Margaret O'Mara worked in the Clinton administration for Al Gore, but for the last decade she's been a University of Washington professor focused on the history of national politics and tech policy. She agrees with Rainwater that proximity to the tech industry may have played an instrumental role in regulation efforts like those seen in the Bay Area or in the state of Washington, where lawmakers considered a facial recognition moratorium last year. In tech policy battles, like the kind that took place over commercial internet in the 1990s, a small cadre of lawmakers on both sides typically become subject matter experts, but as the issue moves forward, lawmakers tend to attach their own political priorities. For Republicans, that can mean ensuring police get to use facial recognition as they see fit. For Democrats, it can translate to the protection of civil liberties and privacy. Arguments by left-leaning cities include fears of abuse by federal immigration officials like ICE, overpolicing in communities of color, and a growing understanding that facial recognition systems have a history of underperforming[15] for people of color, particularly women. The emergence of pockets of facial recognition regulation in early 2019 was also part of concerted efforts by organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The EFF was part of a coalition that campaigned for a police body camera moratorium in California[16], while the ACLU helped draft legislation in multiple cities that voted to pass bans. In recent weeks, the ACLU filed a lawsuit[17] against the FBI, Department of Justice (DoJ), and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) for failure to respond to freedom of information requests and government agency use of facial recognition tools from AWS and Microsoft. The ACLU has also waged a persistent media campaign to increase public awareness of performance bias in Rekognition, AWS' facial recognition tech, by using it on members of Congress[18], the California state legislature[19], and even NFL players. 'That is a very tried and true and effective strategy,' said O'Mara. 'If you go back 100 years to the Progressive Era, reformers who wanted to change the system started at the state and local level and moved their way upwards, and that was a very effective way to do it.' Back in the 1990s, when policy for today's commercial internet was being created, organizations like the EFF also helped shape policy by meeting with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.).Broader tech issuesFacial recognition regulation is not the only tech issue that's getting bipartisan support; efforts to regulate tech giants and better protect user privacy on other fronts are also gaining ground. In late October, Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) worked together to introduce the ACCESS Act, a bill requiring social media companies like Facebook to make user data portable. (Doing so could help make way for social media alternatives to Facebook.) In July 2018, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter[20] became inaugural members of the Data Transfer Project to move data between platforms. 'It's really intriguing because we're in a moment where Republicans and Democrats really don't agree on anything, [but] on many issues of tech regulation, they're sort of strange political bedfellows,' O'Mara said. It appears feelings of existential threat can inspire lawmakers to work together. Local and national lawmakers in the U.S. cite facial recognition applications in China \u2014 where the technology is being used to track dissidents, catch criminal suspects, scan subway passengers, power commerce, and publicly shame jaywalkers \u2014 as concerning. This kind of widespread implementation, and the prospect of similar privacy invasions at home, have generated a sense of urgency among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 'What the Chinese government has done very effectively is deployed facial recognition on a broader basis, and people look across to China and kind of see where it's going. And I think our thing was 'Let's pump the brakes on this a little bit,' and that's fair,' O'Mara said. The fight around facial recognition is separate from antitrust regulatory efforts to break up big tech monopolies, though there is some overlap. But concerns about the biggest tech companies' dominance is an issue that has also garnered some semblance of bipartisan support. '[Tech regulation] is going to be the defining issue of the next decade,' O'Mara said. 'I see it as sort of dominating the policy conversation in the way that the regulation of big oil and railroads and steel in the first decade of the 20th century was a dominant conversation.' O'Mara said the current political moment reminds her of attempts to regulate the modern commercial internet in the 1990s and of the antitrust issues that arose during Teddy Roosevelt's presidency (1901-1909). 'I've studied that past era deeply, and the parallels are striking. It's not history repeating itself, but it's no surprise that these very large companies have come under such sharp regulatory scrutiny simply because they are too big to ignore and escape,' she said. 'I mean, these large companies are pretty nervous because it's not just one party that's criticizing them; it's both.' When it comes to regulation of facial recognition technology, local and national efforts seem to be running on perpendicular tracks. In local politics, lawmakers in left-leaning cities lead the way. In Congress, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) is acting chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee, but Cummings' death appears to have left a power vacuum[21], and Jordan seems busy defending the president against impeachment. The committee could return to legislation that was reportedly being drafted by Cummings and Jordan or advance a bill to ban facial recognition in most public housing facilities[22] that was cosponsored by committee members Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.). While Democrats and left-leaning politicians have moved first to legislate facial recognition in the U.S., lawmakers from all levels of government and political parties are likely to join the fray, because in contrast to virtually every previous form of identification, you can't hide or opt out of your face.

It uses biometric data, our faces, in a wide variety of contexts,\" Schippers explains. \"For example, our faces can work like a password: we have phones that can be unlocked with facial recognition technology. It is used in the home and increasingly in businesses such as shopping centres, bars, and leisure centres. It is also used in the provision of public services or in policing and border control. But while a password can be changed fairly easily, our biometric data is highly personal and sensitive. That's what makes this issue so pertinent.\"</p><p>Facial images can be collected and analysed live, in near-real time, often without our knowledge or consent, which, as Schippers contends, is a problem. FRT also works with historical images that are held for example by private corporations or state agencies. Once these images have been captured and processed, they can be used to match individuals against an image database, such as passport or driving license pictures, police watchlists, or even against images scraped from our social media accounts.</p><p>These days, FRT is rarely out of the news. For example, attempts have been made recently to introduce FRT into schools. Already prevalent in the Chinese education system and increasingly widespread in the United States, schools in France and Sweden have sought to introduce the technology. A secondary school in Kilkenny was forced to scrap a scheme intending to use FRT to monitor attendance when it was informed by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that such a scheme may be in breach of European data protection regulations.</p><p>The analysis of facial expressions can also be used for emotion recognition. \"Technology that claims to establish our emotional states from our facial expression is becoming popular in China and its deployment is deeply worrying,\" Schippers says.</p><p>It is in the human rights arena, and FRT's impact on human rights, that Schippers's work focuses. \"Human rights are interrelated and interdependent. This makes it impossible to identify a single right that is not affected by the deployment of FRT,\" she says. \"The debate has focused on the right to privacy, but this technology impacts across the whole spectrum of civil, political, social and economic rights. For example, there are persistent concerns over its accuracy rates, which are lower when analysing darker-skinned and female faces. This gender and racial bias stems from the predominantly white, Asian, and male images that populate the data training sets used to develop FRT.\"</p><p>Worries over the gender and racial bias of FRT are compounded if public agencies, especially those working in sensitive areas such as the police, are unduly influenced by this technology. This is contrary to the right to human review over decisions that affect our lives and not to be subjected to algorithmic decision-making systems. \"It would be hasty and ill-considered for any police force to use a technology that produces biased outcomes, and whose efficacy and accuracy remains an issue of concern,\" Schippers argues. \"The discriminatory effects of FRT could undermine trust in the fairness of policing, and will leave the police vulnerable to accusations of bias and discrimination.\"</p><p>The invasive impact of FRT remains a key worry. \"Deployed in public spaces, FRT leads us on a path towards automated blanket surveillance, very often without our knowledge. It is a blunt instrument that violates the principles of necessity and proportionality; as the UK Information Commissioner's Office has argued, the collection and processing of data with FRT must be targeted, specific, intelligence-led, and time-limited. Also, the use of live FRT by the police in spaces frequented by the public denies citizens the opportunity to give informed consent to the recording and analysing of their images.\"</p><p>The capacity for mass surveillance also threatens our democratic right to freedom of expression and assembly, Schippers says. \"FRT has a chilling effect on our democratic culture and on our rights as citizens in a democratic society. Blanket surveillance facilitated by FRT can deter individuals from attending public events, and it can stifle participation in political protests and campaigns for social change. We already have evidence that suggests that citizens, especially people from Black and ethnic minority background, and younger people, are reluctant to participate in public protests if their faces are recorded and analysed by FRT,\" she says.</p><p>Deployed in public spaces, FRT leads us on a path towards automated blanket surveillance, very often without our knowledge. It is a blunt instrument that violates the principles of necessity and proportionality.</p><p>While FRT enables mass surveillance, it can also be used selectively. FRT-operated police body cameras and handheld mobile devices with a FRT app are one example Schippers cites to illustrate how biometric data \"can be used to target specific communities, very often ethnic minority communities who are already over-policed and whose relationship with the police is already fraught. I do not see FRT as a useful tool for policing, quite the opposite,\" she says. \"It raises the spectre of enhanced racial profiling at the street level.\"</p><p>There are additional fears over data security and data breaches, but a particular concern relates to the sharing of our facial images between public agencies and private corporations. \"We simply don't know what happens to our images, where they are stored, for how long, and why, or who has access to them,\" Schippers says. \"But there are also worries over the sharing of sensitive biometric data between public bodies and private corporations. Evidence from the United States attests to the close relationship between the business interests of private corporations that develop and sell FRT, and its use by state agencies, such as the controversial US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\" The sharing of biometric data happens on this side of the Atlantic, too. \"Last summer, the Metropolitan Police admitted that it gave images to the privately owned, but publicly accessible King's Cross Estate between 2016 and 2018.\"</p><p>However, opposition to the use of FRT by police forces, especially in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, is gathering momentum, and this trend is shaping the decisions of big tech corporations. IBM has just announced its departure from the FRT business; Microsoft has halted the sale of its FRT to police forces, and Amazon has introduced a one-year moratorium on the sale of FRT to the police.</p><p>The Scottish Parliament Justice Sub-Committee on Policing has recently rejected plans to invest in live FRT, a decision that Schippers welcomes. \"FRT is often presented as a useful policing tool, but I do not think that it is particularly helpful to the police. I have serious concerns that it will undermine relationships between the police and the communities it is meant to serve.\"</p><p>Human rights and civil liberties activists are warning that the development and deployment of FRT should be halted until its compliance with national and international human rights law can be fully ascertained. As Schippers explains, there is a growing movement calling for a moratorium on the use of FRT. For example, a UK Private Members' Bill, which seeks to prohibit the use of automated FRT in public places, is currently debated in Westminster. A similar bill, which aims to prohibit biometic surveillance by federal government, has been introduced in the United States Congress. Schippers also says that there is a need for a \"much wider ranging public conversation and debate\" on the topic than there currently is. \"What we need is sufficient and independently verifiable evidence that this technology is fully compliant with national and international human rights and equality obligations and standards,\" she concludes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGENDA-34549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGENDA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-SD21-JC02-S00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383009</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 AgendaNi All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>AgendaNi</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23438\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Google, with a sprawling empire of businesses that could feasibly be targets, is in the dark about the focus of the investigation and hopes to learn more this week, according to another person familiar with the situation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both people spoke on the condition of anonymity, and the company declined to comment on the probe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Top antitrust officials have agreed to divvy up oversight of the technology giants. The Federal Trade Commission will take responsibility for antitrust probes of Facebook and Amazon, according to people familiar with the matter, while the Justice Department is set to investigate Apple Inc. as well as Google. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee said late Monday that it plans a bipartisan investigation into whether digital platform companies are using their market power to harm competition.</p><p>Alphabet's stock price closed 6% lower Monday, at $1,036.23 a share. Worry that the tech giants are in regulators' crosshairs pushed the Nasdaq index down 1.6%, and the Nasdaq-100 has now lost 10% since hitting a peak in May.</p><p>At stake is Google's position as one of the most profitable companies in history. Despite the opacity surrounding the U.S. focus, the internet giant already has a well-defined set of arguments for pushing back against antitrust challenges, honed over years of doing battle with regulators, especially the EU.</p><p>The EU has brought three major cases against Google, including how it ranked shopping-comparison sites in search results, requirements for how customers use its display ads network, and its practice of requiring phone makers that used its Android software to pre-load those phones with other Google apps.</p><p>In arguments to European regulators, statements from executives during congressional hearings and interviews with Google reps, a broad outline of the company's antitrust defense is already visible:</p><p>* Google sees itself as a series of free, accessible and extremely helpful services that enable people around the world to learn information and connect with one another.</p><p>* Google says that, unlike Facebook Inc., its core products aren't trying to get people to spend more time on them in return for questionable social value.</p><p>* The company argues that by indexing the web and making its information easily accessible through Google's search bar, it provides an invaluable service to billions of people around the world -- for free.</p><p>These assertions, known as a \"consumer welfare\" argument, have worked for the company in the past. Six years ago, the Federal Trade Commission decided against penalizing Google even though the agency's staff said the company was unlawfully maintaining a monopoly in search and search advertising.</p><p>Google also may consult the playbook it used with the FTC investigation, where the company ramped up lobbying in Washington and funded academics to defend it, said Maurice Stucke, a former Justice Department lawyer who teaches antitrust law at the University of Tennessee. Stucke said, with the latest investigation, Google might say, \"We've dealt with this in the past, and we got through it. We had a game plan. We can do it this time as well.\"</p><p>Google has a large or majority market share in several important industries including online advertising, internet browsers, mobile operating systems and email. But the company argues that the global nature of the internet means it doesn't actually have the power that its critics say it does. Its real competitors are other internet giants, such as Amazon.com Inc. or Tencent Holdings Ltd., the company has said.</p><p>One area where U.S. investigators will probably look closely at Google is its role in the online advertising ecosystem. Google sells much of the online real estate available to advertisers, such as search ads and spots that play before YouTube videos. But it also controls the system that many advertisers use to place and track ads on non-Google websites through its DoubleClick unit.</p><p>Google will probably point to Amazon's recent entry into this space as an example of how online advertising is still a competitive market. Amazon said last week it would buy the assets of bankrupt Sizmek Inc., which was a competitor to DoubleClick before it ran into financial trouble.</p><p>Google's share of the online advertising market has also fallen. Though the company still holds the biggest share of U.S. digital advertising spending, its piece of the pie has declined to 36.2% this year from 40.8% in 2016, according to research firm EMarketer. Amazon and Facebook are still growing, with 8.8% and 22.1%, respectively.</p><p>There's pressure for antitrust enforcers to shift from the consumer welfare standard. Instead of focusing on whether prices are rising for consumers, advocates for a more robust approach have argued that other factors should play a role in shaping enforcement decisions, such as privacy, control over user data and the ability to discriminate against rivals that depend on their platforms. Their ideas are starting to find a home with politicians on both sides of the political spectrum.</p><p>Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has advocated for tougher antitrust scrutiny of the big tech companies since his days as Missouri attorney general.</p><p>During U.S. Atty. Gen. William Barr's confirmation hearing in January, Hawley asked Barr to look at the companies in his new role. On the Democratic side, presidential primary candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has said outright she would break up big tech companies including Google if elected in 2020.</p><p>\"There's a lot of competition amongst big companies,\" Google's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told tech news site Axios last year. \"For the first time, I think there is more international competition than ever before, and I think that's going to hold true.\"</p><p>And because the internet is open, competition is always one click away, the company has argued, adding that if Google stops providing consumers with the best experience, they can easily switch to other products.</p><p>If all else fails, Google has shown itself to be more than willing to cut a deal. In Europe, Google agreed to make changes to several of its major products while also paying multibillion-dollar fines. None of those changes have significantly hampered the company's growth, and the fines barely hurt its stock price. Despite years of aggressive European lawsuits and regulations, Google's core business of selling advertising based on data it collects on its users has not been disrupted.</p><p>Google also has learned some tough lessons. In 2014, the company thought it had a deal with Joaquin Almunia, then EU competition commissioner, over complaints it had unfairly funneled search users to its own products.</p><p>But Almunia couldn't get support from others in the European Commission, and the deal fell apart. Almunia's successor, Danish politician Margrethe Vestager, soon took up the torch, leading to years of investigations and wrangling.</p><p>Google's Kent Walker, then the company's general counsel, was in the room when the Almunia deal was cut. Now he heads all of Google's policy and legal work, making him the point person for dealing with the Justice Department's investigation. It's unlikely Walker will let the same thing happen twice.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: THE JUSTICE Department is preparing to open an antitrust investigation into Google.

Data in recent years show domestic media revenues plummeting, while digital firms scoop up more of the market.</p><p>Michael Geist, professor at the University of Ottawa, said the threat by Facebook is likely to be heard by Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault, who has been among the most vocal opponents of Facebook and Google on the issue.</p><p>\"Guilbeault sees that with what's playing out in Australia, there could be a pretty significant cost,\" Geist said. \"The Australian situation highlights why there's some pretty significant risk for Canada if we decided to go down this particular road and we're seeing it play out in Australia right now.\"</p><p>Guilbeault has in the past floated the idea of imposing regulations to \"level the playing field\" for local media firms. Earlier this year, a panel released a report commissioned by Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Guilbeault that called for \"regulatory intervention to ensure that creators of news are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>Observers in the technology and media spaces are divided over the issue. Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policymakers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently possess, he said. Canada has for the most part followed the lead from Australia, France, Germany and others on the issue.</p><p>\"They don't want to be first,\" Hirsh said. \"They want to look as if they are not necessarily being tough on Facebook, but regulating social media.\"</p><p>He said the threats made by Facebook against Australia is a clear shot across the bow aimed at other countries, and a calculation by the company that disallowing people to share news on social media sites could prove politically unpopular. Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\"</p><p>He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longerterm\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

All of those actions threaten to severely impact advertisers\u2019 ability to target people on the internet.</p><p>The group will be led by Bill Tucker, group evp of the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). Dennis Buchheim, president of IAB Tech Lab, will oversee the Partnership\u2019s technical standards efforts, and Stu Ingis, chairman of law firm Venable LLP, will lead the legal and policy working group.</p><p>The Partnership is split into four working groups: business practices; technical standards; privacy, policy and legal considerations; and communications and education.</p><p>The companies involved in the Partnership are:</p><p>\u201cThe Partnership was created to serve as a collaborative forum for our industry to ensure addressability standards that preserve privacy, provide a consistent and effective framework for advertisers and enrich the consumer experience,\u201d Tucker said in a statement.</p><p>The ad world is teaming up to build new standards just as government officials call for an end to the way consumer data from the real-time ad auctions is used and ultimately sold.A group of 10 senators and members of Congress wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission on Friday calling for an investigation into \u201cwidespread privacy violations by companies in the advertising technology that are selling private data about millions of Americans, collected without their knowledge or consent.\u201d</p><p>Lawmakers are scrutinizing ad-tech companies\u2019 ability to siphon data from the bidstream and sell it at a detriment to both consumers and publishers.</p><p>\u201cThis outrageous privacy violation must be stopped and the companies that are trafficking in American\u2019s illicitly obtained private data should be shut down,\u201d the letter read.</p><p>Lawmakers argue real-time bidding, a mechanism for targeted advertising, is flawed and needs to be regulated. The ad industry is saying it wants to build new standards so it can keep serving targeted ads, but in a privacy-safe way to appease both regulators and Big Tech.</p><p>\u201cThis initiative is about new solutions for addressability, with privacy compliance attached to it,\u201d said Buchheim, adding that there\u2019s an opportunity to \u201cdo something that\u2019s better\u201d instead of simply maintaining the status quo of online advertising.</p><p>The FTC acknowledged receipt of the letter but did not comment on next steps, including whether an investigation will take place.</p><p>\u201cI think what that letter is aimed at are bad actors who are using data outside of how it\u2019s supposed to be used in the programmatic ecosystem. I think anybody at this table would have a similar view of the senators, which is people shouldn\u2019t be using data outside of what the permitted uses are in that environment,\u201d said Ingis.</p><p>IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg said that advertising companies and the real-time bidding marketplace play a critical role in the internet economy, and that the ad industry depends on consumers who trust that their personal data is used properly.</p><p>\u201cThe IAB condemns the violation of this trust by rogue actors, and is working to further develop industry best practices to ensure that consumer privacy is protected,\u201d Rothenberg said through a spokesperson.</p><p>Consumer privacy ranks first in the Partnership\u2019s initial list of six guiding principles. Other include supporting competition; building standards to support business operations like frequency capping and cross-channel measurement; and building standards that are interoperable between browsers and devices.</p><p>Another guiding principle for the Partnership is that \u201call browsers, devices and platforms should allow equal access, free from unreasonable interference, to the new solutions.\u201d</p><p>The ad industry has to contend with Google removing third-party cookies from its Chrome browser and Apple making its mobile identifier opt-in, which both make targeted advertising more difficult.</p><p>Google and Apple are essentially making independent decisions in the name of protecting consumer privacy, which significantly disrupt marketers\u2019 and ad-tech companies\u2019 current operations.</p><p>\u201cThe more likely or obvious step of regulation would be finding privacy protections that are required and ensuring that [companies] with the level of market position of an Apple or Google in their browser or operating systems don\u2019t interfere with the operations of companies as it relates to those data practices,\u201d said Ingis.</p><p>Ingis added that immediate next steps for the Partnership is to convene the working groups, develop charters and start initiating discussions with browsers and operating systems to \u201chave a back and forth dialogue with them.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1184177</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HG-THH1-DYRK-H186-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 4, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Given its dominant position, regulators are expected to file suits against the company later this year.</p><p>The Alphabet-owned company is expected to see its digital advertising market share drop to 29.4% this year partly as a result of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. eMarketer forecasts that Google\u2019s ad revenue will drop by 5.3% to $39.58 billion in 2020, which would be the first time the company\u2019s ad revenue didn\u2019t increase year-over-year.</p><p>Google has two major buy-side platforms: Google Ads, for smaller advertisers; and DV 360, for large brands and agencies. According to a blog written by Sissie Hsiao, vp and general manager of apps, video and display advertising at Google, the company only charges advertisers using Google Ads a fee when a consumer takes an action on an ad, like clicking on it.</p><p>\u201cBecause Google Ads does not charge advertisers for most impressions, it does not have a fixed per-impression fee. Instead, Google\u2019s share of revenue varies over time based on various factors, including the advertisers\u2019 specified objectives, the types of display ads they choose to run and how users respond to them,\u201d Hsiao wrote.</p><p>Google\u2019s take rate for DV 360 is up to 15%, and its exchange takes a cut of up to 20%.</p><p>\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t know what other companies charge, we\u2019ve shared our pricing to provide clarity into how our display business works. By helping businesses large and small reach customers, we can help publishers fund their content online and contribute to sustaining the ad-supported web for people around the world,\u201d said Hsiao.</p><p>Publishers typically only receive 51% of every dollar spent through programmatic, according to a recent report from the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA). Google\u2019s take rates seem favorable, but neither blog post details every single fee, such as the company\u2019s agency fee. Also, Google\u2019s 20% sell-side take rate is roughly double the average cut that ISBA found.</p><p>The blog posts only addressed how Google works with publishers, where the digital ad giant earns a minority of its revenue. Google\u2019s main revenue sources are its owned and operated properties, like YouTube and Google Search. Marketers can only buy that inventory through Google\u2019s ad-tech stack.</p><p>However, the posts were met with derision from some in the industry with vocal Big Tech critic Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, a trade org that represents the interests of publishers, taking to social media in order to make his opinion known.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1171234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606S-1011-JC8H-T3V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Thanks to massive developments in artificial intelligence (AI), cameras and surveillance systems can now check and analyse someone's facial features in real time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a profound step forward in the realms of biometric security, and major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM have started selling such systems.</p><p>The technology has huge potential to help with policing and crime prevention. Recording a face in a crowd and checking it against a watchlist of suspects could potentially prevent acts of terrorism or violence. It is already in use by police forces in some countries, and even in schools in the US in the hope of preventing active shooter situations.</p><p>It could also boost productivity in other sectors of the economy. Airports have been using facial recognition software for years to speed up passport checks, leading to a more convenient experience for travellers.</p><p>Similarly, the analyst firm CCS Insight predicts that, within a few years, organisations like football clubs will adopt facial recognition ticketing systems, allowing ticketholders to gain entry to an event more quickly, while enabling staff to identify possible troublemakers.</p><p>And there are plenty more potential applications, from use in recruitment to retail, which sound fantastic on paper. But if we're not careful, the technology poses a threat to our personal privacy and civil liberties - fundamental principles of society . For a start, facial recognition's ability at present to identify individuals is far from perfect, especially those from minority communities.</p><p>Civil liberties groups in the US, concerned that the software will lead to more false arrests, have highlighted how Amazon's cloud-based Rekognition wrongly identified 28 non-white members of Congress and two dozen professional athletes as people who had committed crimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, a recent study from the University of Colorado Boulder found that several facial recognition platforms regularly misidentify trans and non-binary people.</p><p>Work is underway to address these inaccuracies. Nick McQuire, head of enterprise and AI research at CCS Insight, predicts that a new industry will emerge to tackle the biases that may be causing these mistakes.</p><p>\"The need to resolve these data and compliance challenges will spark the emergence of firms such as algorithmic auditors and companies that help source high-quality, diverse and unbiased training data,\" he says.</p><p>Algorithmic auditors may sound like characters from sci-fi, but these kinds of businesses are already emerging, according to McQuire, who cites O'Neil Risk Consulting and DefinedCrowd as examples.</p><p>However, even if the tech worked perfectly, the implications are immensely worrying.</p><p>Its use by government authorities, especially in mainland China, has raised fears that individuals - perhaps taking part in a peaceful demonstration - could be picked out of a crowd, followed, and punished at a later point. This threat of repercussions has forced protesters in Hong Kong to use face paint and masks to avoid being identified by AI-enabled cameras.</p><p>Fearing the impact on civil liberties, several US cities, including San Francisco, have placed bans on the tech. And earlier this year, Amazon had to face down a rebellion by shareholders who wanted to block it from selling Rekognition to US police forces.</p><p>Here in the UK, a developer faced a similar backlash after admitting to using facial recognition surveillance at the King's Cross Estate, while the use of the technology by police in south Wales is being challenged in the courts.</p><p>Defenders of facial recognition technology point to the public acceptance of CCTV, which has been used for decades for security and crime prevention. But while CCTV simply records video which later has to be checked by a human, facial recognition software can identify and keep track of an individual's face, analyse the data, and store it in a database - without the person's consent or even knowledge.</p><p>And it's not just police and security forces who could exploit the ability to identify and track any individual caught on camera. Andrew Liles, chief technology officer at experience agency Tribal Worldwide London, gives me just one chilling example of how private companies could misuse this data.</p><p>\"A social media platform has filed a patent to tell a retailer something about a customer who is in their shop,\" he says.</p><p>\"They do this by finding the person based on their social profile - perhaps they can guess your income bracket and what you have searched for beforehand. It could reveal that information to the retailer, and you'd be none the wiser. That's scary.\"</p><p>Clearly, facial recognition offers new potential for private organisations to collect huge amounts of sensitive personal data without individual <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.consent.No\">www.consent.No</url> technology is inherently good or evil - the problem lies in how it is used. Rules and regulations are needed to prevent both governments and companies from abusing facial recognition software.</p><p>And, indeed, due to fears about the risk of its misuse, the European Commission is planning legislation that will extend the general data protection regulation (GDPR) to cover AI, and give EU citizens explicit rights over the use of their facial recognition data - which is a good start. The key will be ensuring the protection of consumers without stifling innovation.</p><p>\"Facial recognition is a powerful tool, transforming the way we live,\" says Anton Christodoulou, group chief technology officer at experience agency Imagination. \"Legislation and regulation is required to ensure that it is implemented within the right privacy framework, and the boundaries of its use are clearly defined and enforced. Once regulated, we will all be able to enjoy the benefits to their full effect.\"</p><p>Some companies are already trying to get ahead of any new regulations. Amazon's Jeff Bezos revealed in September that the company has its own public policy team working on proposals which it hopes governments will adopt, although politicians and activists are likely to balk at the idea of trusting big tech to write its own rules. Expect more scrutiny on these companies and their efforts in the near future.</p><p>Facial recognition has developed incredibly fast, perhaps faster than regulators and governments know how to deal with. The big tech companies will need to work with them, as well as the new breed of AI-auditors, to address the risks to privacy, consent, and civil liberties.</p><p>Otherwise, we risk stumbling into a science-fiction dystopia, rather than a technological paradise.</p><p>Facial recognition is a powerful tool, transforming the way we live</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-154123101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-2V61-JCBW-N4SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1118\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

The superpower has withdrawn from or declined to ratify the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and, most recently, the Paris Climate Accord.  </p><p>Each of those was an attempt to deal with a major global issue, but in each instance the US went its own way. If the threat of nuclear apocalypse wasn?(EURO)(TM)t quite enough to bring the US on side, what hope do a few social media posts have?  </p><p>Under a President who has pledged to put America first and had few qualms about raising international tensions with a series of trade fights, there?(EURO)(TM)s little indication that the US will suddenly adopt a global approach when sitting down with the G7 leaders next month.  </p><p>If recent reports out of the US are anything to go by, the country is already charging down a different path from the rest of the world.  </p><p>At a private meeting on Tuesday, President Donald Trump met Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the importance of ?(EURO)oeprotecting the health of the public conversation ahead of the 2020 US elections?(EURO). This followed numerous accusations of bias, with Trump claiming conservative voices were being silenced amid social media companies?(EURO)(TM) efforts to clamp down on extremist content and fake accounts.  </p><p>While the rest of the world is concerned about how little is being done to curb extremism online, the message from the most powerful politician in the US seems to be that social media?(EURO)(TM)s censorship efforts sometimes go too far and that tech giants wield too much power over public discourse.  </p><p>With these two worldviews set to meet next month, it could devolve into a collision course rather than a collaborative show of unity.  </p><p>Drawing the lineAs the volume dials up on calls for stronger regulation of social media, the free speech acolytes are also becoming louder in airing their concerns about the impact any regulatory efforts might have on online freedom.  </p><p>Ardern isn?(EURO)(TM)t oblivious to that debate and was quick to distance the G7 meeting from any consideration of free speech.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThis isn?(EURO)(TM)t about freedom of expression,?(EURO) she said during a press conference on Wednesday.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeThis about preventing violent extremism and terrorism online. I don?(EURO)(TM)t think anyone would argue that the terrorist on the 15th of March had a right to livestream the murder of 50 people. And that is what this call is specifically focused on.?(EURO)  </p><p>These points are all valid, but any steps to clamp down on the publishing or distribution of content will invariably lead to questions about what is and isn?(EURO)(TM)t appropriate. Even viewed in a vacuum, Ardern?(EURO)(TM)s specific focus poses complex questions: What do we define as terrorism? What types of groups do we allow on social media? Do we continue to permit anyone in the world to livestream when they please?  </p><p>The Ted Talk stage recently provided a glimpse of how seemingly simple problems can become complex when they play out on social media. When asked why Twitter doesn?(EURO)(TM)t simply get rid of Nazis, Dorsey explained that even something as widely reviled as Nazism can be difficult to define on social media.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeWe?(EURO)(TM)re in a situation right now where that term is used fairly loosely, and we just cannot take any one mention of that word accusing someone else as a factual indication that they should be removed from the platform,?(EURO) Dorsey said.  </p><p>Like the rest of the tech world, the Twitter boss is betting heavily on the potential of artificial intelligence to eventually allow truly offensive and harmful content to be weeded out efficiently and effectively.  </p><p>But until that happens, many of the tough decisions on social media are being outsourced to human eyes, like those of the content moderators cramped into Mumbai offices and charged with the responsibility of identifying fake news on Facebook in the lead-up to the Indian election.  </p><p>Prepare for a fightSocial media organisations get away with such a bare-minimum response to fake news and extreme content only because they have long been able to hide behind the fact that they are only platforms, not media channels. This rule is enshrined in the Communications Decency Act passed by Congress in 1996, and there have been few indications of it changing any time soon.  </p><p>Without the burden of having to employ the staff numbers necessary to run a media company responsibly, the big tech companies?(EURO)(TM) profits have soared. And the tech giants aren?(EURO)(TM)t simply going to sit back and watch their margins being ripped apart by the efforts of a few foreign governments.  </p><p>Facebook?(EURO)(TM)s Mark Zuckerberg has already called in reinforcements, this week appointing Jennifer Newstead as general counsel, tasked with defending Facebook as international pressure mounts.  </p><p>Newstead isn?(EURO)(TM)t your standard, run-of-the-mill the lawyer. She was plucked straight out of Trump?(EURO)(TM)s State Department and previously played a major role in selling the Patriot Act to the US Congress.  </p><p>That controversial piece of legislation was developed in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and greatly increased the US government?(EURO)(TM)s ability to conduct surveillance on its own citizens.  </p><p>If anything, this sends a strong message that Facebook won?(EURO)(TM)t be a pushover as it starts to work with governments on reshaping social media in a world that no longer accepts the hands-off approach.  </p><p>Ardern and Macron better come prepared for a fight.      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHMedia26</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYT-2TP1-JDK8-V559-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1010\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 26, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

NEWS.COM.AU TECHNOLOGY WRITER NICK WHIGHAM LOOKS AT HOW MUCH THEY HAVE AND HOW YOU CAN CHECK YOUR OWN FILE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IT WAS the first day of pre-school. After my mum leaned down and gave me one final bear hug, I was off to start my education as I casually waved her away without looking at her - clearly she was cramping my style.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I don't remember this seminal moment, but I happened to stumble upon the footage this week by complete happenstance.</p><p>The video is of a TV screen playing an old VHS tape and appears to be taken on a camera phone.</p><p>My guess is my younger sister found the tape and filmed the video to send to me. But maybe I should just ask Facebook, because that's where I found it - in the huge file containing my extensive Facebook history the company keeps on me.</p><p>Since the moment I, and everyone else signed up, the social media service has been collecting and keeping everything - and I seriously mean everything - we have ever done on the site.</p><p>All the conversations, videos, pictures and documents we have shared or have had sent to us are all held on a server somewhere with space specially dedicated to each of us.</p><p>I downloaded the cache (it's very easy to do) to check out everything Mark Zuckerberg had on file about me from over the years.</p><p>It included scanned copies of lease forms from a previous rental property I must have sent to my buddies over Messenger, my current tenant ledger report, an old monthly billing statement for my home broadband, screen shots of banking transfers and seemingly endless web pages of all the banal conversations I have ever had on the platform.</p><p>It's one thing to know Facebook holds all this data (and much more) on you but it is another thing to trawl through it and find things even you had forgotten about yourself.</p><p>It's an odd feeling to think that, in some ways, Facebook knows you better than you know yourself.</p><p>Looking through the 500MB zip file you can see your \"Ads History\" which stores what ads you've ever clicked on as well as all the advertisers who Facebook has shared your contact information with.</p><p>It has facial recognition data (Facebook has 105 examples of what I look like), exhaustive photo metadata including your location and the time the photo was taken and data about every time you logged onto the site such as the IP address, location, browser and device used.</p><p>My file also contained the names and numbers for everyone in my iPhone's contact list - and yours certainly will too.</p><p>Apparently I clicked a Jacob's Creek ad last month.</p><p>With machine learning and powerful data analysis, Facebook can do immense things with everyone's data.</p><p>Facebook not only knows everything you've ever done on its platform but via cookies it leaves in your web browser it also tracks you wherever you go on the internet - even if you don't use Facebook.</p><p>I, like so many others, opened my Facebook account just over a decade ago. Arguably it's the first time in history that 10 years of human behaviour has been meticulously gathered, stored and analysed by a company on this scale.</p><p>It's called surveillance capitalism and it's the reason why Mark Zuckerberg is worth $92 billion.</p><p>But as the public and regulators become increasingly aware of just how deep Facebook's tentacles extend into our digital lives, the company is facing increasing political headwinds.</p><p>Earlier this month Belgium ordered Facebook to stop tracking internet users who have no accounts with the social network, or face fines of 250,000 euros ($A390,000) a day.</p><p>The ruling came amid efforts by the European Union to force Facebook to comply with stringent new privacy rules that would threaten its ability to sell advertising based on targeted user information.</p><p>Now Australia has become the latest government to turn up the heat on the Zuckerbergs of the world.</p><p>The Federal Government has ordered the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to investigate the big tech giants in what ACCC chairman Rod Sims said will be the broadest inquiry of its type in the world.</p><p>The ACCC's inquiry will involve asking consumers how much they think the digital platforms know about them and comparing that to what is, in fact, being gathered.</p><p>\"Some people have asserted that consumers know what's going on and don't care,\" Mr Sims said last week. \"I think it's absolutely crucial we find out what consumers do know and then let's see whether they care.</p><p>\"My suspicion is Facebook and Google have much more personal information about people than people realise.\"The inquiry will be looking at whether Facebook, Google or others have -misused their power in commercial dealings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWNBUL-TownsvilleBulletin20180314Townsville18000362490848</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QTWNBL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVX-G8W1-F0JP-W2GB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463812</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Townsville Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Townsville Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 14, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Bi...</p><p>The regulation of big technology companies including Facebook and Alphabet Google has been a hot button issue ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.   Here is a look at the stances of Republican President Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, on some key tech policy issues:   BREAKING UP BIG TECH COMPANIES   Biden, who was vice president during the Silicon Valley-friendly administration of President Barack Obama, has criticized Facebook and other tech giants during his campaign and proposed a minimum federal tax aimed at companies like Amazon.com Inc.   Trump, who has mixed relationships with tech companies, bashing Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, but meeting with Apple Inc's Tim Cook, has said \"there is something going on in terms of monopoly\" when asked about big tech firms.    The Trump administration is conducting a wide-ranging antitrust probe into major tech companies and is expected to bring an antitrust case against Google.   Trump and Biden have stopped short of calling for the companies to be broken up, but Biden and his vice presidential pick Kamala Harris - a senator and former attorney general for California, the home of Silicon Valley - have said they would seriously look at the idea of dismantling companies like Facebook.   REGULATING SOCIAL MEDIA   Both Biden and Trump have blasted social media companies over their handling of political content. Trump, whose digital campaign helped propel him to the White House in 2016, has long accused the companies, without evidence, of censorship against conservatives.   After Twitter Inc put fact-checking labels on Trump's tweets for the first time in May, the president signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms' content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230 - a federal law largely exempting online platforms from legal liability for the material their users post.   Biden, who has clashed with Facebook over its more hands-off stance to politicians' ads and speech, also wants to revoke Section 230. He was the only Democratic presidential candidate to call for its repeal.   DATA PRIVACY   Congress has tried, without success, to build consensus on federal consumer privacy legislation, which the Trump administration signaled support for.   Biden has said the United States should set privacy \"standards not unlike the Europeans,\" an apparent reference to the European Union's stringent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).   Privacy advocates have slammed the Trump administration for repealing broadband privacy laws that required internet providers to get consumer consent before using certain types of their data, and for actions they say violate immigrants' privacy.   The Trump administration has also lambasted Silicon Valley over encryption, criticizing Apple for what the president called its refusal to unlock phones used by criminals.   Recently, Trump has stepped up efforts to purge what it deems \"untrusted\" Chinese apps from U.S. digital networks: in August, the president ordered the sale of TikTok's U.S. arm, saying he might otherwise shut it down over concerns that user data could be passed to China's government.   DIGITAL DIVIDE   The coronavirus pandemic, which has driven education and work online, has exposed inequalities in access to high-speed broadband.   Trump has said he is committed to ensuring \"every citizen can have high-speed internet access,\" though Democratic rivals criticized him over the continuing digital divide on the campaign trail. In January, the Federal Communications Commission approved a $20 billion rural broadband expansion fund.   Biden said he also plans a $20 billion investment in rural broadband infrastructure and to triple funding to expand access in rural areas, as part of a package his team proposed to pay for through tax increases on wealthy Americans.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Facebook insists it does not want to be responsible for false political advertising. So I\u2019d like to help Mr Zuckerberg out by fact checking a few of the points of disinformation in his own communications.\u00a0</p><p>Let\u2019s put aside the total non-starters \u2014 like the fact that a man who has become a billionaire via\u00a0 surveillance capital\u2014 the industrial-scale monetisation of personal data \u2014 invokes the civil rights leaders Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King in his efforts to avoid appropriate regulation. Instead let\u2019s start with Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s assertion that Facebook is part of the \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Estate\"> fifth estate</url>\u201d.</p><p>The 1960s term, which refers to a counterculture of journalists and intellectual outsiders who are critical of mainstream society, is associated with a Detroit-based anarchist magazine of the same name, which was struggling against, among other things, capitalism. Facebook, on the other hand, is one of the flagships of surveillance capitalism. The fact that Mr Zuckerberg (or his minders) chose that phrase reveals a shocking lack of historical perspective.\u00a0</p><p>That would not make them unique in Silicon Valley. The line reminded me of a \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"http://business.time.com/2014/01/24/eric-schmidt-george-soros-a-tale-of-two-titans/\"> fireside chat</url>\u201d that former Google chairman Eric Schmidt gave in Davos back in 2014, in which he laid out the future as he saw it. Massive technology-related job destruction would require more people to become more entrepreneurial, he predicted. When asked about whether Big Tech companies should pay higher tax rates to help out with that whole \u201cdisruption\u201d thing, Mr Schmidt said he thought that would squelch innovation. I guess neither Franklin Roosevelt nor his New Deal had come to mind as the marketing material for the \u201cfireside chat\u201d was being written. In California, it is the future that matters, not the past.\u00a0</p><p>But back to Mr Zuckerberg. It is, of course, absurd to posit that a company with a half-trillion dollar market capitalisation in any way represents the counterculture. But it is also untrue for both Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to suggest they simply couldn\u2019t have imagined how big and powerful Facebook would get, and how much control it would wield over consumers, companies, and even countries.\u00a0</p><p>To imagine it, all you have to do is go back and read\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/361/1/1998-8.pdf\"> the original paper on search</url> written by the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google was the first company to practise surveillance capitalism at scale, creating the targeted advertising business model. The founders had initially viewed tracking people\u2019s behaviour and selling the information to advertisers as anathema.\u00a0</p><p>As they wrote back in 1998, \u201cwe expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers. Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search-engine bias is particularly insidious\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>What that means is that the targeted ad-based business model that has enriched both Google and Facebook, as well as many other platforms, is uniquely vulnerable to misuse. It is a fact that could not have escaped the leadership at Facebook, particularly Ms Sandberg, who\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/technology/05facebook.html\"> actually helped perfect the Google ad model</url> before moving to Facebook. No wonder Facebook does not want to do more vetting of political advertising. Surely, once there is more transparency, even more areas of concern would begin to appear.\u00a0</p><p>It is not surprising to me that Mr Page and Mr Brin, in that same 1998 paper, said they believed: \u201cThe issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.\u201d That seems close to an admission that the largest technology platforms in areas like search, social media and ecommerce are, in fact, like public utilities \u2014 networks that are as essential as water, heat, or electricity \u2014 and should be regulated as such.\u00a0</p><p>Given all this, it is stunning that Mr Zuckerberg continues to push ahead with plans for Libra, a private payment system. I\u2019ve argued that faster cross-border digital currency flows may be counterproductive to financial stability at this particular moment, as they could encourage\u00a0 hot money flows.\u00a0</p><p>But the most galling point of the Capitol Hill testimony was when Mr Zuckerberg told Congress that if the US didn\u2019t roll out a plan like Libra, China would \u201cmove quickly to launch similar ideas\u201d. The notion that Facebook is not only a patriotic defender of US free speech, but a protector of its competitive place in the world is too much to take.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook is a giant advertising company that would love to be in the Chinese market itself. It has, in its short life, done more harm than good. Every time Mr Zuckerberg appears in public, it becomes more obvious that his company will need to be curbed by regulation. In the EU, internet users now have a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. I bet some Facebook investors wish they could press the delete button on Mr Zuckerberg.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p>Letter in response to this column:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Companies like Facebook hold all the cards / From Axel Lieber, Tokyo, Japan</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-a08230a8f6fe11e9a79cbc9acae3b654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCC-77P1-JB77-K122-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 27, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Even so, Mark Zuckerberg's speech at Georgetown University and his testimony on Capitol Hill last week are worthy of note. Facebook insists that it does not want to be responsible for false political advertising. So I'd like to help out Mr Zuckerberg by fact-checking a few of the points of disinformation in his own communications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's put aside the total non-starters, like the fact that a man who has become a billionaire via surveillance capital - the industrialscale monetisation of personal data - invokes the civil rights leaders Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King in his efforts to avoid appropriate regulation. Instead, let's start with Mr Zuckerberg's assertion that Facebook is part of the \"fifth estate\".</p><p>The 1960s term, which refers to a counterculture of journalists and intellectual outsiders who are critical of mainstream society, is associated with a Detroit-based anarchist magazine of the same name, which was struggling against, among other things, capitalism. Facebook, on the other hand, is one of the flagships of surveillance capitalism. The fact that Mr Zuckerberg (or his minders) chose that phrase reveals a shocking lack of historical perspective.</p><p>That would not make them unique in Silicon Valley. The line reminded me of a \"fireside chat\" that the former Google chairman Eric Schmidt gave in Davos back in 2014, in which he laid out the future as he saw it. Massive technologyrelated job destruction would require more people to become more entrepreneurial, he predicted.</p><p>When asked about whether Big Tech companies should pay higher tax rates to help out with that whole \"disruption\" thing, Mr Schmidt said he thought that would squelch innovation. I guess neither Franklin Roosevelt nor his New Deal had come to mind as the marketing material for the \"fireside chat\" was being written. In California, it is the future that matters, not the past.</p><p>But back to Mr Zuckerberg. It is, of course, absurd to posit that a company with a half-trillion-dollar market capitalisation in any way represents the counterculture. But it is also untrue for both Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg to suggest they simply could not have imagined how big and powerful Facebook would get, and how much control it would wield over consumers, companies and even countries.</p><p>To imagine it, all you have to do is go back and read the original paper on search written by the founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Google was the first company to practise surveillance capitalism at scale, creating the targeted advertising business model. The founders had initially viewed tracking people's behaviour and selling the information to advertisers as anathema.</p><p>As they wrote back in 1998: \"We expect that advertising-funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers.

The installation of back-up power systems such as inverters and UPS systems is, therefore, inevitable. This industry is growing swiftly, both in terms of size and demand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Initiatives like the National Solar Mission have also fuelled solar based backup power solutions. Interestingly, the demand for power from rural and semi-urban areas has also accelerated, contributing significantly to the growth of the UPS and inverter industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Factors driving the inverter and UPS system market</p><p>Currently, there is a huge demand for inverters and UPS systems in various sectors across India. The major driver is the IT sector, followed by the IT enabled services and industries, including telecom, banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), and manufacturing. Low electrification in semi-urban and rural areas has also led to the rising demand for power inverters, which are being used as an alternate power source during power cuts and emergencies. Besides, the heavy use of electronic gadgets and appliances such as mobile phones, laptops, smart TVs, air conditioners, etc, has led to the requirement of more backup power. The market has also witnessed the introduction of many new technology trends and innovations to address changing consumer preferences and lifestyles. Portable power inverters to charge mobile phones and tablets that are very easy to carry anywhere are a major driver of the inverter and UPS system market.</p><p>Sharing his insights, K. Nagaraj, director, Sakthi Accumulators Private Limited, says, \"UPS systems and inverters are no more luxury products. Gone are the days when only the rich got inverters installed at their homes and UPS systems at their offices. Today, every office, institution and business is IT driven. No one can work without computers and mobile phones. With these devices becoming a part of our daily lives, UPS systems too have become a part and parcel of it. No more can we take those power cuts and interruptions lightly. We look for immediate alternative power sources and UPS systems fit the bill. However, the biggest reason for the adoption of UPS systems and inverters is the shortage of power, and the gap between demand and supply.\"</p><p>Sachin Bhalla, senior VP - marketing, Luminous Power Technologies, adds, \"With the changing lifestyles of the consumers, there is an increasing need for seamless power supply, which is the leading factor driving the industry's growth.\"</p><p>Besides, the National e-Governance Plan that aims to usher in an era of e-governance, will also drive the market in a big way. The main purpose of the initiative is to computerise and digitise various government offices and departments, for which seamless supply of energy is required.</p><p>* K. Nagaraj, director, Sakthi Accumulators Private Limited</p><p>* Sachin Bhalla, senior VP - marketing, Luminous Power Technologies</p><p>Technology trends</p><p>One of the technology trends with regard to inverter and UPS systems is a shift towards solar based solutions. Solar power inverters come with a separate solar charge controller to regulate the power from solar panels. And the UPS system is equipped with two inbuilt chargers -the grid charger and solar charger, which provide an instant power supply in case of power breakdown. Besides, demand for power tracking technology such as maximum power point tracker (MPPT) based solar inverters is picking up, as a shift from the typical pulse-width modulation (PWM) inverters.</p><p>According to Bhalla, there are three big tech trends in the Indian backup power market:</p><p>Green UPS systems are getting popular due to the concerns about energy efficiency and environment hazards. The green UPS design brings down energy consumption by up to 75 per cent compared to traditional UPS models. This helps in improving energy efficiency as well as lowering carbon emissions. Another trend is the shift to transformer-less UPS systems. These systems are efficient when it comes to handling IT loads and data management applications. They are installed with insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) that regulate high voltages; as a result, a step-up transformer is not required after the inverter. In addition, transformer-less UPS systems are light and have a small footprint.</p><p>What is next?</p><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has raised expectations of enhanced intelligence from inverters and UPS systems. Rather than being standalone devices, these systems operate in close connection with an intelligent network of nodes. IoT systems alert consumers about impending problems in advance, enabling preventive maintenance. Plus, the third-party maintenance feature enables maintenance services 24/7, via remote monitoring.</p><p>Nagaraj believes that customers now expect everything to be small and sleek. Complete sine wave inverters today come with an attractive look and smart features like mobile connectivity, as well as an app that shows the status of the inverter, the current battery charge status, hours of usage, remaining backup expected, etc.</p><p>Market trends</p><p>As per a report from Research on Global Markets, the Indian UPS market is expected to reach  99.83 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 11.97 per cent. Growing investments in IT and the rapid development of the IT sector have significantly contributed to the growth of the UPS system market. Increasing awareness about the need to protect important data is benefiting the market. The Indian inverter market is expected to reach  277.83 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 9.33 per cent. Growth in the inverter market can be attributed to the demand for power backup solutions across the residential, commercial as well as industrial sectors. Besides, there is rising demand from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities as well.</p><p>Nagaraj notes, \"The inverter business is seasonal. Normally, the peak season is between February to June and the off season from July to January. During the peak season, many people install new systems as they expect power interruptions and inconvenience during summer.\" He says that now, every new home being built comes with an inverter, which adds to the business. No office, too, can afford to lose valuable data due to power interruptions. Therefore, a UPS system has become an integral part of it.</p><p>Market scenario - organised and unorganised players</p><p>The market for inverters and UPS systems in India is highly fragmented due to the presence of unorganised and organised players. The unregulated players have 40 per cent of the market, primarily in Tier-3 towns and in rural areas, catering to consumers who are price sensitive. The organised sector is mostly dominated by branded products. The unorganised market is still a very big threat to the industry. The unorganised players don't have enough infrastructure for R&amp;D or for testing the products. Due to poorly designed products and improper manufacturing methods, they flood the market with low cost, low quality products.</p><p>Nagaraj says, \"Due to poor quality, the failure rate is also very high for products from the unorganised sector. This creates a very bad image about the product itself. Customers tend to feel that inverters and batteries don't last long and that clients have to incur replacement or repair costs continuously. This affects their purchase decisions. In Tier 3 towns, UPS systems and inverters are bought from local shops and dealers, who take the customer for a ride. These devices should come into the white goods category and be sold through dealers. This way, customers can expect better service from the manufacturer.</p><p>Bhalla has a different view. He feels that the inverter market is very developed and organised. According to him, the top two players account for 75 per cent of the market. The reason for this skew is the demand for high performance and quality products by the consumers.</p><p>Key challenges in the Indian inverter and UPS system market</p><p>Products from the unorganised sector are available at a much lower price compared to those in the organised sector. This difference has compelled many organised players to reduce their prices. Such practices create unhealthy and unsustainable competition, and can also lead to a compromise on the quality of the products.</p><p>Highlighting another important facet of the industry, Nagaraj says, \"The power situation is not uniform in all parts of our country. In a few places the power cuts and interruptions are quite low, while in other regions they are quite high. This variation is very important to factor in when designing and placing a product. One product will not work well in all regions of the country. Each market or region requires a different kind of product. This is a very big challenge for the industry. Manufacturers first have to understand the market and region, before placing their product there.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ELEBAZ-0051093380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ELEBAZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-0401-JB5M-W3MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390082</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 EFY Enterprises Pvt Ltd., distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Electronics Bazaar</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TS6</classCode><className>ENERGY DEMAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEFE</classCode><className>INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000576</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Garages, such as the oncat Steve Jobs' childhood home, or the one where Bill Hewlett and David Packard invented Silicon Valley. Some were college dorm rooms, where Mark Zuckerberg and Michael Dell launched their fortunes. To this tradition, add a walk-in closet in a Park City, U\u00cehh, duplex where a newly discharged Marirreinamed David Morken created Bandwidth.com to bring faster internet connections to businesses in 1999. The explosion of fiber was making broadband more available, but small and medium-sized businesses weren't the focus of big telecoms. Morken built a website for companies trying to figure out how to ditch their dial-up, sending them to carriers.</p><p>Today, Bandwidth (the \".com\" was dropped in 2017) has more than 700 employees - two times as many as just two years ago - and an early June stock-market value of more than $1.7 billion. With spacious offices at N.C. State University's high-tech Centennial Campus, Bandwidth little resembles the broadband broker of its infancy. It is one of the largest players in the fast-growing telecom sector known by the arcane acronym CPaaS - Communications Platform as a Service.</p><p>If you have clicked on a phone number in the Rover app to interview a dog walker, you have used a CPaaS. If you have gotten a message on your phone about a job opening from ZipRecruiter, you've used the technology. Twofactor authentication, that little code to verify that you are you, is possible because of companies like Bandwidth.</p><p>Businesses have jumped all over the technology that lets them communicate with customers instantly.</p><p>Along the way, Bandwidth also created mobile-phone company Republic Wireless, which emphasizes ultra-low monthly rates and a heavy reliance on Wi-Fi.</p><p>Unlike most CPaaS companies. Bandwidth operates its own nationwide internet-based voice and data network, built a decade ago when its business was providing more responsive and cheaper phone service for companies than the big carriers. It survived the dot-com and telecom collapses of the late '90s and early 2000s, and for most of its existence, had little access to outside capital.</p><p>But it survived because of Morken's faith - in God and himself - and his vision, tenacity and inspirational leadership, friends and colleagues say. And a few breaks that some might call luck, others might call answered prayers.</p><p>\"You want to understand David Morken?\" asks longtime friend and former Bandwidth President John Murdock. \"He's a preacher who happens to be a businessman.\"</p><p>RELIGIOUS ROOTS</p><p>Morken was born in Los Angeles 50 years ago into a family of faith. His missionary grandparents barely made it out of the Indonesian island of Sumatra after Pearl Harbor. His paternal grandfather, the Rev. David Enoch Morken, accompanied a young Billy Graham during a mission to soldiers in Korea in 1952. Morken's father, Hubert, was a professor of religion and politics at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa in the 1980s, where David went to college.</p><p>David had just gained admission to Notre Dame Law School when Operation Desert Storm began in 1991. TV images from the war made an impression on Morken, who joined the Marines and attended Officer Candidate School. \"I graduated [from Oral Roberts] in May,\" Morken recalls, \" went to Quantico for 10 weeks, got out in August and a week later I'm sitting in the front row of Constitutional Law with a shaved head at Notre Dame, a second lieutenant.\"</p><p>As he was finishing law school, Morken encountered the technology that would shape his career and make his fortune. The internet, developed for government and academic researchers, burst into widespread public use with web browsers. Next-generation fiber-optic networks were coming into view, with almost limitless transmission capacity compared with copper wires and dial-up modems.</p><p>The light went on for Morken when he read an article by George Gilder, a conservative futurist who predicted that this fiber-driven exponential growth in bandwidth would transform the economy. Murdock, a Marine veteran of Desert Storm, was a Notre Dame classmate of Morken's and remembers that moment.</p><p>\"David had started with the Wild West of reserving domain names,\" Murdock says. \"David's like, 'I reserved all of these domain names, one of which is bandwidth.' I'm like, 'Bandwidth?' And he says, 'You know, there's this World Wide Web, and there's this guy Gilder ... and you gotta read this stuff.'\"</p><p>While his active duty was delayed, Morken started two online ventures, a tax-filing service and a company marketing mutual funds. Just as those were gaining traction, Morken got his callup. He sold his fledgling businesses and spent the next four-and-a-half years as a prosecutor. In the summer of 1999, with three children, a fourth on the way and his time in the Marines coming to an end, Morken was turning 30 and needed a next move. His assets consisted of three months paid leave, some domain names and an idea. So he built a website, bandwidth.com.</p><p>A MILLION-DOLLAR OFFER</p><p>The business model was simple: Companies were looking for faster internet connections, and when they plugged the word \"bandwidth\" into search engines, Morken's website came up. Big telecom companies would pay Morken a cut of deals he sent them.</p><p>At the time, Morken, his wife and children shared one side of a rented duplex with his parents. \"I was making phone calls from a clothes closet so you [couldn't] hear my 1-year-old screaming in the next room.\"</p><p>Morken knew the modest early success wouldn't last as bandwidth became a commodity, but in the beginning it paid the bills. After one month, he caught a break. Forbes decided to write a story about him. \"The day before the article comes out, I'm under my desk praying. 'Lord, I need a business partner. I can't carry this pack alone.'\"</p><p>After the article appeared in September 1999, the closet phone started ringing. Gary Winnick, billionaire founder of network giant Global Crossing Holdings Ltd., offered Morken $1 million for the domain name.</p><p>Another call came from North Carolina - a guy named Henry Kaestner was also interested in the domain. Kaestner had a company that traded electricity on the wholesale markets through the internet. That phone call is why Bandwidth is in Raleigh today.</p><p>THE KAESTNER CONNECTION</p><p>Kaestner was working at a brokerage in New York City, trading energy derivatives, but wanted to set up his own shop. He couldn't afford to pay New York salaries, so he needed to relocate. At the same time, his wife was interested in pursuing her doctorate.</p><p>So they pulled out a map. \"My only prerequisite was that there needed to be a nonstop flight to New York and one to Houston,\" says Kaestner, referring to the centers of energy finance. Kimberly Kaestner wanted to get her Ph.D. at UNC Chapel Hill, and Raleigh-Durham International had the flights.</p><p>After Kaestner learned the domain was priced way out of his range, the two men talked about another idea, big bandwidth prospects Morken might be able to send Kaestner. They also shared a mutual interest in biking. The two entrepreneurs hit it off.</p><p>Morken flew to the Triangle and they went mountain biking in Chapel Hill. Several months later, Kaestner traveled to Utah. Mountain biking in Park City \"is infinitely more fun than mountain biking in Chapel Hill,\" Kaestner says.</p><p>A few years later, broadband commodity trading had stalled out, so the two decided to join forces. Morken persuaded Kaestner that, despite Utah's pronounced edge in skiing and mountain-bike trails, proximity to the Triangle's universities and Research Triangle Park made it the place to grow a company. \"I won the argument,\" Morken says.</p><p>THE EVOLUTION DF BANDWIDTH</p><p>Recall the million-dollar offer from Winnick? \"I sat with Chrishelle, my bride, and said, 'I think God wants us to build this company.' And she said, 'I agree, let's do it.'\"</p><p>But what kind of company? The 1.0 version of Bandwidth - matching broadband customers with big telephone companies - wasn't enough.</p><p>\"At first I was just generating leads,\" Morken says. \"I would never know if anything closed. I had to depend on a sales rep at AT&amp;T to confirm: 'Did you close?'</p><p>\"So that was a key moment, to go from just generating a lead ... to being a sales organization, then a sales and support organization, and billing, and ultimately I built our own network.\"</p><p>In 2003, the company began buying bandwidth in bulk from large carriers and reselling it to corporate customers. The significance was that Bandwidth had the relationships with customers, or as Kaestner put it, \"Now we had paper on the deal.</p><p>\"So we loved that model. We went from an average of probably 12% [margins] to around 18-20%. A significant step up.\"</p><p>The rapidly evolving telecom environment had other ideas. Competitors began selling voice in addition to data over the same lines, and Bandwidth needed to enter the voice business. It was going to have to become a competitive local exchange carrier, known as a CLEC and more simply called a phone company. Bandwidth was late to the game, which wasn't a bad thing.</p><p>Tite telecom landscape was littered with the wreckage of companies - like Winnick's Global Crossing, bankrupt by 2002 - that had spent billions to build out fiber-optic networks, chasing the same customers. The crash left behind underused fiber and telecom data centers where Bandwidth could plug in and create a national internet-based network.</p><p>\"That became the focus of our growth,\" Morken says. \"We realized we could build a network, a voice network, and this was the important moment in 2007, 2008 ... kind of in the middle of the financial crisis. Out of those ashes we built the last really CLEC ever built. Out of the ashes of the largest value-destruction ever. The CLEC wipeout. The dot-com wipeout,\" he says.</p><p>\"We had the last-mover advantage,\" Morken recalls. \"The forest fire burns, and this little green shoot pops up.\"</p><p>GETTING GOOGLE</p><p>By now, Bandwidth had grown from a small office outside RTP with 10 employees and Morken and Kaestner sitting across a desk working the phones all day long to a building in Cary on Weston Parkway.</p><p>In the earliest days, Kaestner led sales, and Morken handled product delivery. Kaestner was a major reason Bandwidth survived its first decade, Morken says. \"He is going to change the status quo in an early-stage company where everything is uncertain, and you must knock down every obstacle.\" Kaestner would step down as CEO in 2009 to launch a private-equity fund focusing on faith-driven entrepreneurs.</p><p>Morken's Notre Dame classmate, Murdock, joined Bandwidth, initially as general counsel to oversee dealings with carriers and state and federal regulators that were required to set up a national footprint.</p><p>Bandwidth's timing was good because major internet giants such as Google and Microsoft needed help integrating software and telecom.</p><p>As Murdock put it, \"Silicon Valley [was] getting into voice.\"</p><p>Meaning that the big tech companies were going to be driving the next wave of growth in telecom, says Chris Chuang, who joined Bandwidth in 2008 and rose to chief operating officer. Google became the Bandwidth network's first customer when it set up its Google Voice phone service in 2009, marking a significant coup.</p><p>\"We were very fortunate early on to have some great customers, some big, recognizable customers,\" says Brian Bailey, a Charlotte private-equity banker and Bandwidth director. \"And for people to say, 'Gosh, if they're working with Google, they've got to be good.'\"</p><p>Since turning on its phone network, Bandwidth has supplied businesses with 60 million phone numbers, 10% of the numbers in North America. Many of the numbers are used by traditional office phones. But many are at the heart of CPaaS.</p><p>BEYOND A PHONE COMPANY</p><p>When Bandwidth built out its network a decade ago, it was unknowingly developing a communications platform that would transform it from a phone company into a software business. Companies desired to communicate instantly with customers through voice, text messages or other applications.</p><p>Rover wanted pet owners to easily - but cautiously - contact a prospective dog sitter by a voice call or text message.</p><p>\"You might look at someone's references,\" says Adam Covati, Bandwidth's head of research and development. \"You might decide you want to call them. And you're not sure you want to do business with this person. So what happens is, you'll call an intermediary number, and the person who receives the call will receive the call from that intermediary number.</p><p>\"You guys only know that number. You don't know each other. And you have that conversation. Now, you may choose not to work with that person and you don't want them harassing you.\" So the phone number goes away.</p><p>But it was more complicated than just quickly supplying an abundant inventory of phone numbers for clients to embed in applications. The trick was also developing easy-to-use libraries of code called application programming interfaces, which sat in front of Bandwidth's servers so the clients' applications - click here to place a call, click there to send a text message - could talk to the servers and get to work.</p><p>Google, Microsoft and others \"needed both the network and a software-friendly way to interface with the network,\" says Chuang, who is now CEO of spinoff Republic Wireless. \"We had to expose the network to them in ways that were easy for web developers to use.\"</p><p>There wasn't a high-level meeting to launch a new business model. \"We were just solving problems for customers and we were writing code,\" Murdock says. \"We backed into CPaaS.\"</p><p>GOING PUBLIC</p><p>While it had raised $4.75 million in \"friends and family\" capital in 2005, Bandwidth didn't secure its first major round of outside money until 2011. Charlotte-based Carmichael Partners, run by Bailey and former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin, put up $22 million to help Bandwidth buy a Colorado-based 911 provider. Bailey is a former managing partner at Carousel Capital Partners LLC in Charlotte, while Martin is now Facebook's vice president for U.S. public policy.</p><p>\"We believed that over time ... software would disrupt the industry,\" Bailey says. The big carriers weren't going away but were \"going to get nibbled at consistently for the next 10 years, 20 years, 50 years,\" he says.</p><p>Bandwidth was doing its share of the nibbling. Revenue of $2.5 million in 2003 expanded to more than $204 million by 2018. It's profitable growth, unlike some other players in the CPaaS space. Shares of rival San Francisco-based Twilio have risen nearly 10 times since a 2016 initial public offering and the company is now valued at about 10 times Bandwidth's market cap, but it has never posted an annual profit.</p><p>North Carolina entrepreneurs have never had access to the magnitude of venture capital showered on Silicon Valley area startups, so positive cash flow is more hard-wired into companies here. \"The small amount of capital that Bandwidth has raised versus a lot of other companies in similar type spaces is pretty striking,\" Bailey says.</p><p>But the potential of the CPaaS market, perhaps $10 billion globally by 2025, according to IDC analyst Courtney Munroe, holds out lucrative opportunities if Bandwidth can scale up, especially overseas.</p><p>\"I realized that we could go faster than our cash flow was providing if we raised capital,\" Morken says. So Bandwidth went public at the end of 2017, netting about $74 million. A follow-on stock offering netted $147 million this year. The results of expanded sales and marketing: Active CPaaS customers grew by nearly a third, year over year, in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>The growth has been noticed by investors. In early June, Bandwidth - which went public at $20 a share - was trading in the $70s.</p><p>Today, Morken's nearly 12% stake is worth about $200 million. His ownership of Class \u0412 stock gives him around 33% control of the voting shares and his long-time friend, Kaestner, controls another 25%. So even after going public, Morken is in control.</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, after the Forbes article ran, Morken got a call from Sequoia Capital, famous for its early investments in Apple, Google and Oracle. The company wanted him to come out for a meeting. When he visited the Menlo Park-based investment group, executives showed him a term sheet. They wanted him to merge his company into one of their companies. \"And I'd have to give up control,\" Morken says. \"So I said no.\"</p><p>Morken wasn't flying out until the next day, but he went to the airport anyway and drove his rental car into a parking deck. He put the seat back so folks walking by the car couldn't see him, and he went to sleep. That way, he would be out only $8 for the parking space and not the price of a hotel room, which he couldn't afford at the time, having walked away once again from a deal.</p><p>And that's why Bandwidth is still Morken's business, just like it was back in Utah when all he had was a phone, a closet and prayer. *</p><p>\"I WAS MAKING PHONE CALLS FROM A CLOTHES CLOSET SO YOU [COULDN'T] HEAR MY 1 -YEAR-OLD SCREAMING IN THE NEXT ROOM.\"</p><p>David Morken</p><p>HIGH ON Wl-FI</p><p>Republic Wireless, the mobile phone company launched in 2011 by Bandwidth, gained widespread publicity with an ultra-low monthly rate and a Wi-Fi-first business model. It began as an experiment borne of necessity.</p><p>Chris Chuang, now Republic's CEO, was hired by Bandwidth cofounder David Morken in 2008 to work on strategy. Bandwidth's main business, reselling broadband connections to small and medium-sized businesses, was hitting a plateau.</p><p>There were three initiatives: One was creating a CLEC, an internetbased competitive local exchange carrier that would help software companies embed telecom in their applications; a second was Phonebooth, a low-cost, cloud-based office phone system for small businesses; and a third was creating a wireless phone.</p><p>\"We called it Phonebooth Mobile to start with,\" Chuang says. \"It was, 'Hey, can we sell a wireless phone at a low price with our bundle of [high-speed data] and Phonebooth phone system?\"' When the product launch fell flat, Republic tried something bolder: a $19 monthly plan on low-cost Wi-Fi phones with a backup connection to Sprint's network. With most people around Wi-Fi connections much of the time, company officials expected a strong response.</p><p>As Republic tested the plan in November 2011, the TcchCrunch website ran a story that went viral. \"We had like a hundred thousand people at our website trying to buy, or at least interested,\" recalls Chuang, who was then Bandwidth's chief operating officer. \"We didn't even open the store because our [e-commerce| site was not working for the first 12 hours. In between midnight and 3 a.m., we sold out our whole one-year worth of stock. ... 5,000 phones in three hours.\"</p><p>In late 2016, Republic was spun off as a separate private company, with Chuang as CEO and Morken as chairman. Bandwidth put up $30 million to capitalize the business, which now operates in a separate Centennial Campus building.</p><p>Chuang says the company has \"hundreds of thousands of customers\" and nearly $100 million in annual revenue. \"We actually would be profitable if we weren't investing in our new product, called Relay.\" The screenless walkie-talkie-like device lets children communicate with a parent's phone with the push of a button.</p><p>But battling Verizon, AT&amp;T and other wireless powers is tough. In May, Republic had an unspecified number of layoffs \"to better align our organization and resources with our growth mission,\" Chuang says. Media reports estimated about 20% of Republic's staff was dismissed.</p><p>FAMILY FOCUS</p><p>An organization's culture is a reflection of values at the top. So when CEO David Morken says vacations are \"PTO embargoes,\" Bandwidth employees don't get called, texted or emailed. Paid time off means off.</p><p>\"When I first got started,\" says Noreen Allen, Bandwidth's marketing chief and a 20-year veteran of Triangle tech companies, \"I thought 'Whatever. I've heard stuff like this before.'\"</p><p>But she discovered it was real and it was \"a David thing ... Family has always been important to him. He wanted to make sure that people had time for family and had time to go recharge.\" Morken and his wife, Chrishelle, have six children. Employees are encouraged to leave the office by 6 p.m. so they can be home with family.</p><p>Morken is a serious fitness guy and has churned countless miles as a triathlete, ultramarathoner and long-distance cyclist. The company gives the staff 90 minutes to work out at lunch so they don't have to squeeze in gym visits at the expense of family time. A trolley takes staff to a nearby N.C. State University: gym, or there's a fitness center on site. Bosses are careful not to schedule meetings anywhere near lunch.</p><p>Then there are the chaplains. Two come in once a week and walk around and talk to employees. \"I have to admit [at first] I was a little bit like, 'Ooh, I don't know about this, chaplains in the office?\"' Allen says.</p><p>Then late in her first year, an employee who had been recruited to move to North Carolina with his wife and two young children suffered a heart attack and was at Duke University Hospital. One chaplain sat tor a week with the staffer's wife and one with his sons. Bandwidth flew in family members for visits.</p><p>\"I quickly became a big supporter of the chaplains,\" Allen says.</p><p>FOUNDED:</p><p>1999, Park City, Utah</p><p>HEADQUARTERs:</p><p>Centennial Campus, NC.

Meeting that challenge, however, has never felt as urgent as it feels now. And technology companies have never felt so pressured to figure out how to do it quickly, at scale. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently assured members of Congress that advances in machine learning over the next few years will improve and more fully automate what he admits has been a deeply flawed process for removing banned content from Facebook. </p><p>In an op-ed[1] published in The Washington Post, Zuckerberg actually recommended federal legislation requiring online platforms to 'build systems' that block unwanted speech.Whereas Zuckerberg is relatively new to the filtering faith, the music and film industries have long extolled the virtues of enforcing copyrights online through automated content recognition[2] (ACR) technology. For the better part of the last fifteen years, these industries have been arguing that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's reactive framework for removing infringing user-generated content (UGC) from online content-sharing platforms is woefully inadequate, and that such platforms should be required to deploy proactive 'technical measures' for preventing copyright infringement. Music industry lobbyists point to YouTube's voluntarily-implemented Content ID system[3] as proof that filtering technology is available and affordable. If YouTube is already filtering, they argue, why not just make it a legal requirement for everyone? The music industry views a statutory filtering mandate as the key to capturing revenue now lost in what they call the 'value gap[4]' between what YouTube pays to license copyrighted music and what on-demand streaming services like Spotify pay. In the United S[5]tates and the European U[6]nion, YouTube and other UGC-sharing platforms have historically been protected by statutory safe harbors that insulate them from liability for users' infringements, as long as they comply with rightholders' takedown requests. Safe harbors give UGC-sharing platforms the legal cover they need to provide open forums for public expression.Because safe harbors in their original form put the burden of monitoring for infringement on rightholders, YouTube has had no regulatory incentive to assume that burden. It has, however, had a business incentive to offer the music industry's big players access to Content ID in return for licenses to popular content. The terms of those licenses have been negotiated in the shadow of the safe harbors and include what rightholders believe are unfair ad revenue splits for views of infringing UGC videos that rightholders use Content ID to monetize instead of blocking. At the end of the day, the music industry doesn't want infringing UGC kept off YouTube. That would mean giving up a prime market that has so far been worth more than six billion dollars to them in ad revenue[7]. What the music industry wants is a bigger share of YouTube's pie, and it aims to get that by convincing policy makers to alter the regulatory incentives around monitoring for all services that allow users to publicly share content.Now that streaming has supplanted paid downloads[8] as the dominant format for digital music delivery, the music industry wants all platforms that stream copyrighted content to be treated equally under copyright law\u2014regardless of the fact that dedicated music platforms like Spotify don't host UGC at all and therefore don't face the open-ended legal risk that safe harbors are designed to limit. Nor do closed platforms like Spotify offer the general public open-ended opportunities for self-expression and creative production. Because UGC platforms are open to all comers, they cannot possibly proactively license the entire universe of copyrighted content their users might ever upload. That's why safe harbors exist, and why they have historically placed the burden of monitoring for infringements ex post on rightholders. Wealthy tech giants like YouTube and Facebook can likely afford to bear the legal risk associated with narrowed safe harbors. And they can afford to bear the high cost of operating sophisticated ACR systems in terms of both technological and human resources. (In a 2018 report[9] on the company's anti-piracy efforts, Google said it has invested $100M in building and operating Content ID.) Emerging and smaller online businesses lack such resources, however. Constricting safe harbors through de facto or de jure monitoring obligations for platforms could therefore substantially limit dynamism at the Internet's now highly concentrated edge, where consumers find themselves locked in to mega-platforms with few competitors. Copyright policy adjustments aimed at redistributing wealth from Big Tech to Big Music risk the unintended consequence of further entrenching the few that can 'pay to play' under a tightened liability regime.As the U.S. Copyright Office mulls recommending changes[10] to the scope of the DMCA safe harbors, and EU member states prepare to transpose Article 17 (formerly Article 13) of the controversial Digital Single Market (DSM) Copyright Directive[11] into domestic law, now is a good time to take a hard look at whether it makes sense to hardwire ACR systems like Content ID into copyright law through 'notice-and-staydown' requirements. Many urgent questions arise: Should the wide universe of UGC services that have flourished for two decades under the protection of safe harbors lose that protection so that Big Music can secure bigger payouts from Big Tech? Is the public's interest served by changes to copyright law that could exponentially elevate operating risk for all online services that allow users to share content? Should copyright safe harbors be conditioned implicitly or explicitly on platforms' implementing ACR systems? Are such systems accessible and sustainable for services that lack YouTube's resources? Are ACR systems fit for purpose when it comes to protecting lawful expression, including fair use of copyrighted material? If not\u2014and we do have ample evidence of their limits[12]\u2014how strongly should that militate against public policies requiring or encouraging broader deployment? The public needs and deserves evidence-based answers to these questions before new laws favoring or requiring deployment of ACR systems are enacted. In Europe, these questions are now largely moot, given parliamentary approval[13] of the DSM Copyright Directive. In the United States, however, the conversation about potential modifications to the DMCA is only getting started. It is seductive to look for technological solutions to content-related problems on massive platforms like Facebook and YouTube. Given the urgency and the scale of some of those problems, it is in the interest of both the platforms themselves and policy makers to put their faith in a quick technological fix. The public, however, should be skeptical, because the competitive and expressive costs of making UGC platforms filter everyone's speech before it can be shared will be profound.

It's not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner.</p><p>Facebook apparently didn't take action until notified by state-government officials who noticed the ads.</p><p>The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users  with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise further questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections - and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation - loom.</p><p>\"This is definitely concerning - definitely, it's misinformation,\" said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections. \"I keep telling people: We don't have any basis to regulate such a thing.\"</p><p>Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms.</p><p>In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake solar-energy ads disappeared. After complaints from governors' offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all of the ads and several pages affiliated with them.</p><p>\"These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,\" company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement. \"We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.\"</p><p>Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies.</p><p>Governors' offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians featured alongside claims such as \"you can get paid to go solar.\"</p><p>After researching solar-panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw the ad last year claiming he might qualify for \"free\" solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release \"$100 million solar incentives.\"</p><p>He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but worried others might not be.</p><p>\"It's very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p><p>Though the FTC can investigate fake ads, sue to stop them and seek compensation for victims, thousands of ads targeting select groups run online daily, making it harder to catch suspect advertisers.</p><p>Scam ads are popular in certain industries, such as insurance or solar power, where companies are looking for people they can target later for products and services, said Peter Marinello, vice president of the Council of Better Business Bureaus Inc.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-VA0093227090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT3-0FT1-DY37-F32T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition>1ST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Her post attracted 144 \"likes.\"<br/>A few months later, as an experiment, researchers paid a company a few dollars to attract attention to her well wishes. In 30 minutes, the post had 100 more likes. The researchers had similar results on a holiday post on Vestager's Instagram account and on a Christmas tweet from Vera Jourova, the European Union's justice commissioner.</p><p><br/>Companies like Facebook and Twitter are poorly policing automated bots and other methods for manipulating social media platforms, according to a report released on Friday by researchers from the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence. With a small amount of money, the researchers found, virtually anyone can hire a company to get more likes, comments and clicks.<br/>The group, an independent organisation that advises the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, tested the tech companies' ability to stop paid influence campaigns by turning to 11 Russian and five European companies that sell fake social media engagement. For (EURO)300, the researchers bought over 3,500 comments, 25,000 likes, 20,000 views and 5,000 followers, including on posts from prominent politicians like Vestager and Jourova.<br/>After four weeks, about 80 percent of the fake clicks remained, the researchers said. And virtually all of the accounts that had been used to generate the clicks remained active three weeks after the researchers reported them to the companies.<br/>The report spotlights the continuing challenges for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as they try to combat online disinformation and other forms of online manipulation. After Russia interfered in the United States' 2016 presidential election, the companies made numerous changes to reduce the spread of online disinformation and foreign interference. In recent months, the platforms have announced takedowns of accounts in China, Saudi Arabia and, most recently, Africa, where Russia was testing new tactics.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>But the report also brings renewed attention to an often-overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks' software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.<br/>\"We spend so much time thinking about how to regulate the social media companies - but not so much about how to regulate the social media manipulation industry,\" said Sebastian Bay, one of the researchers who worked on the report. \"We need to consider if this is something which should be allowed but, perhaps more, to be very aware that this is so widely available.\"<br/>From May to August, the researchers tested the ability of the social networks to handle the for-hire manipulation industry. The researchers said they had found hundreds of providers of social media manipulation with significant revenue. They signed up with 16.<br/>\"The openness of this industry is striking,\" the report says. \"In fact, manipulation service providers advertise openly on major platforms.\"<br/>The researchers bought engagements on about a hundred posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. They saw \"little to no resistance,\" Bay said.<br/>After their purchase, the researchers identified nearly 20,000 accounts that were used to manipulate the social media platforms and reported a sample of them to internet companies. Three weeks later, more than 95 percent of the reported accounts were still active online.<br/>The researchers directed most of the clicks to posts on social media accounts they had made for the experiment. But they also tested some verified accounts, like Vestager's, to see if they were better protected. They were not, the researchers said.<br/>The researchers said that to limit their influence on real conversations, they had bought engagement on posts from politicians that were at least six months old and contained apolitical messages.<br/>Researchers found that the big tech companies were not equally bad in removing manipulation. Twitter identified and removed more than the others, the researchers found; on average, half the likes and retweets bought on Twitter were eventually removed, they said.<br/>Facebook, the world's largest social network, was best at blocking the creation of accounts under false pretenses, but it rarely took content down.<br/>Instagram, which Facebook owns, was the easiest and cheapest to manipulate. The researchers found YouTube the worst at removing inauthentic accounts and the most expensive to manipulate. The researchers reported 100 accounts used for manipulation in their test to each of the social media companies, and YouTube was the only one that did not suspend any and provided no explanation.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-391549</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPK-6DS1-JBYT-H10H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And virtually all of the accounts that had been used to generate the clicks remained active three weeks after researchers reported them to the companies.</p><p>  The report spotlights the continuing challenges for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as they try to combat online disinformation and other forms of online manipulation. After Russia interfered in the United States' 2016 presidential election, the companies made numerous changes to reduce the spread of online disinformation and foreign interference. In recent months, the platforms have announced takedowns of accounts in China, Saudi Arabia and, most recently, Africa, where Russia was testing new tactics.</p><p>  But the report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks' software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.</p><p>  ''We spend so much time thinking about how to regulate the social media companies -- but not so much about how to regulate the social media manipulation industry,'' said Sebastian Bay, one of the researchers who worked on the report. ''We need to consider if this is something which should be allowed but, perhaps more, to be very aware that this is so widely available.''</p><p>  From May to August, the researchers tested the ability of the social networks to handle the for-hire manipulation industry. The researchers said they had found hundreds of providers of social media manipulation with significant revenue. They signed up with 16. </p><p>  ''The openness of this industry is striking,'' the report says. ''In fact, manipulation service providers advertise openly on major platforms.''</p><p>  The researchers bought engagements on about a hundred posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. They saw ''little to no resistance,'' Mr. Bay said. </p><p>  After their purchase, the researchers identified nearly 20,000 accounts that were used to manipulate the social media platforms, and reported a sample of them to the internet companies. Three weeks later, more than 95 percent of the reported accounts were still active online.</p><p>  The researchers directed most of the clicks to posts on social media accounts they had made for the experiment. But they also tested some verified accounts, like Ms. Vestager's, to see if they were better protected. They were not, the researchers said. </p><p>  The researchers said that to limit their influence on real conversations, they had bought engagement on posts from politicians that were at least six months old and contained apolitical messages.</p><p>  Researchers found that the big tech companies were not equally bad in removing manipulation. Twitter identified and removed more than the others, the researchers found; on average, half the likes and retweets bought on Twitter were eventually removed, they said.</p><p>Facebook, the world's largest social network, was best at blocking the creation of accounts under false pretenses, but it rarely took content down. </p><p>Instagram, which Facebook owns, was the easiest and cheapest to manipulate. The researchers found YouTube the worst at removing inauthentic accounts and the most expensive to manipulate. The researchers reported 100 accounts used for manipulation in their test to each of the social media companies, and YouTube was the only one that did not suspend any and provided no explanation.</p><p>  Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, said easy social media manipulation could have implications for European elections this year and the 2020 presidential election in the United States.</p><p>  ''Fake engagement -- whether generated by automated or real accounts -- can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,'' Ms. Bradshaw said. ''If these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarization and distrust that exist within society.''</p><p>  Ms. Bradshaw, who reviewed the report independently, said the reason accounts might have not been taken down was that ''they could belong to real people, where individuals are paid a small amount of money for liking or sharing posts.'' This strategy, she pointed out, makes it much harder for the platforms to take action.</p><p>  Still, she said the companies could do more to track and monitor accounts associated with manipulation services. And the companies could suspend or remove the accounts after several instances of suspicious activity to diminish inauthentic behavior.</p><p>  ''Examining fake engagement is important because accounts don't have to be fake to pollute the information environment,'' Ms. Bradshaw said. ''Real people can use real accounts to produce inauthentic behavior that skews online discourse and generates virality.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: A new report by the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence highlights how it is still cheap and easy to manipulate social media.

In 30 minutes, the post had 100 more likes. The researchers had similar results on a holiday post on Ms. Vestager\u2019s Instagram account and on a Christmas tweet from Vera Jourova, the European Union\u2019s justice commissioner.</p><p>Companies like Facebook and Twitter are poorly policing automated bots and other methods for manipulating social media platforms, according to a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html\">report released on Friday</url> by researchers from the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence. With a small amount of money, the researchers found, virtually anyone can hire a company to get more likes, comments and clicks.</p><p>The group, an independent organization that advises the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, tested the tech companies\u2019 ability to stop paid influence campaigns by turning to 11 Russian and five European companies that sell fake social media engagement. For 300 euros, or about $330, the researchers bought over 3,500 comments, 25,000 likes, 20,000 views and 5,000 followers, including on posts from prominent politicians like Ms. Vestager and Ms. Jourova. </p><p>After four weeks, about 80 percent of the fake clicks remained, the researchers said. And virtually all of the accounts that had been used to generate the clicks remained active three weeks after researchers reported them to the companies.</p><p>The report spotlights the continuing challenges for Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as they try to combat online disinformation and other forms of online manipulation. After <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html\">Russia interfered in the United States\u2019 2016 presidential election</url>, the companies made numerous changes to reduce the spread of online disinformation and foreign interference. In recent months, the platforms have announced takedowns of accounts in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html\">China</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html\">Saudi Arabia</url> and, most recently,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html\">Africa, where Russia was testing new tactics</url>.</p><p>But the report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks\u2019 software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.</p><p>\u201cWe spend so much time thinking about how to regulate the social media companies \u2014 but not so much about how to regulate the social media manipulation industry,\u201d said Sebastian Bay, one of the researchers who worked on the report. \u201cWe need to consider if this is something which should be allowed but, perhaps more, to be very aware that this is so widely available.\u201d</p><p>From May to August, the researchers tested the ability of the social networks to handle the for-hire manipulation industry. The researchers said they had found hundreds of providers of social media manipulation with significant revenue. They signed up with 16. </p><p>\u201cThe openness of this industry is striking,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn fact, manipulation service providers advertise openly on major platforms.\u201d</p><p>The researchers bought engagements on about a hundred posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. They saw \u201clittle to no resistance,\u201d Mr. Bay said. </p><p>After their purchase, the researchers identified nearly 20,000 accounts that were used to manipulate the social media platforms, and reported a sample of them to the internet companies. Three weeks later, more than 95 percent of the reported accounts were still active online.</p><p>The researchers directed most of the clicks to posts on social media accounts they had made for the experiment. But they also tested some verified accounts, like Ms. Vestager\u2019s, to see if they were better protected. They were not, the researchers said. </p><p>The researchers said that to limit their influence on real conversations, they had bought engagement on posts from politicians that were at least six months old and contained apolitical messages.</p><p>Researchers found that the big tech companies were not equally bad in removing manipulation. Twitter identified and removed more than the others, the researchers found; on average, half the likes and retweets bought on Twitter were eventually removed, they said.</p><p>The researchers found YouTube the worst at removing inauthentic accounts and the most expensive to manipulate. The researchers reported 100 accounts used for manipulation in their test to each of the social media companies, and YouTube was the only one that did not suspend any and provided no explanation.</p><p>Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social network, was best at blocking the creation of accounts under false pretenses, but it rarely took content down. Instagram, which Facebook owns, was the easiest and cheapest to manipulate. </p><p>\u201cFake engagement tactics remain a challenge facing the entire industry,\u201d Facebook said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re making massive investments to find and remove fake accounts and engagement every day.\u201d</p><p>Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, said easy social media manipulation could have implications for European elections this year and the 2020 presidential election in the United States.</p><p>\u201cFake engagement \u2014 whether generated by automated or real accounts \u2014 can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,\u201d Ms. Bradshaw said. \u201cIf these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarization and distrust that exist within society.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Bradshaw, who reviewed the report independently, said the reason accounts might have not been taken down was that \u201cthey could belong to real people, where individuals are paid a small amount of money for liking or sharing posts.\u201d This strategy, she pointed out, makes it much harder for the platforms to take action.</p><p>Still, she said the companies could do more to track and monitor accounts associated with manipulation services. And the companies could suspend or remove the accounts after several instances of suspicious activity to diminish inauthentic behavior.</p><p>\u201cExamining fake engagement is important because accounts don\u2019t have to be fake to pollute the information environment,\u201d Ms. Bradshaw said. \u201cReal people can use real accounts to produce inauthentic behavior that skews online discourse and generates virality.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: A new report by the NATO Strategic Communications Center of Excellence highlights how it is still cheap and easy to manipulate social media.

In recent months, the platforms have announced takedowns of accounts in China, Saudi Arabia and, most recently, Africa, where Russia was testing new tactics.</p><p>But the report also brings renewed attention to an often overlooked vulnerability for internet platforms: companies that sell clicks, likes and comments on social media networks. Many of the companies are in Russia, according to the researchers. Because the social networks' software ranks posts in part by the amount of engagement they generate, the paid activity can lead to more prominent positions.</p><p>\"We spend so much time thinking about how to regulate the social media companies - but not so much about how to regulate the social media manipulation industry,\" said Sebastian Bay, one of the researchers who worked on the report. \"We need to consider if this is something which should be allowed but, perhaps more, to be very aware that this is so widely available.\"</p><p>From May to August, the researchers tested the ability of the social networks to handle the for-hire manipulation industry. The researchers said they had found hundreds of providers of social media manipulation with significant revenue. They signed up with 16. </p><p>\"The openness of this industry is striking,\" the report says. \"In fact, manipulation service providers advertise openly on major platforms.\"</p><p>The researchers bought engagements on about a hundred posts on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. They saw \"little to no resistance,\" Mr. Bay said. </p><p>After their purchase, the researchers identified nearly 20,000 accounts that were used to manipulate the social media platforms, and reported a sample of them to the internet companies. Three weeks later, more than 95 percent of the reported accounts were still active online.</p><p>The researchers directed most of the clicks to posts on social media accounts they had made for the experiment. But they also tested some verified accounts, like Ms. Vestager's, to see if they were better protected. They were not, the researchers said. </p><p>The researchers said that to limit their influence on real conversations, they had bought engagement on posts from politicians that were at least six months old and contained apolitical messages.</p><p>Researchers found that the big tech companies were not equally bad in removing manipulation. Twitter identified and removed more than the others, the researchers found; on average, half the likes and retweets bought on Twitter were eventually removed, they said.</p><p>The researchers found YouTube the worst at removing inauthentic accounts and the most expensive to manipulate. The researchers reported 100 accounts used for manipulation in their test to each of the social media companies, and YouTube was the only one that did not suspend any and provided no explanation.</p><p>Facebook, the world's largest social network, was best at blocking the creation of accounts under false pretenses, but it rarely took content down. Instagram, which Facebook owns, was the easiest and cheapest to manipulate. </p><p>\"Fake engagement tactics remain a challenge facing the entire industry,\" Facebook said in a statement. \"We're making massive investments to find and remove fake accounts and engagement every day.\"</p><p>Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, a department at Oxford University, said easy social media manipulation could have implications for European elections this year and the 2020 presidential election in the United States.</p><p>\"Fake engagement - whether generated by automated or real accounts - can skew the perceived popularity of a candidate or issue,\" Ms. Bradshaw said. \"If these strategies are used to amplify disinformation, conspiracy and intolerance, social media could exacerbate the polarization and distrust that exist within society.\"</p><p>Ms. Bradshaw, who reviewed the report independently, said the reason accounts might have not been taken down was that \"they could belong to real people, where individuals are paid a small amount of money for liking or sharing posts.\" This strategy, she pointed out, makes it much harder for the platforms to take action.</p><p>Still, she said the companies could do more to track and monitor accounts associated with manipulation services. And the companies could suspend or remove the accounts after several instances of suspicious activity to diminish inauthentic behavior.</p><p>\"Examining fake engagement is important because accounts don't have to be fake to pollute the information environment,\" Ms. Bradshaw said. \"Real people can use real accounts to produce inauthentic behavior that skews online discourse and generates virality.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006861150</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPF-5KR1-DYR7-C00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The internet is our new public square.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the public square of old, journalists and editors served as gatekeepers and acted as referees. Human news aggregators set the agenda and provided audiences with credible information and diverse views. We trusted them because of the professionalism and integrity of their editorial processes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the new public sphere, this model of journalism, and its role in sustaining democracy, has become obsolete. Traditional media no longer play a dominant gatekeeping and agenda-setting role. Fake news reaches myriad jurisdictions at once.</p><p>But so can public and private measures that censor speech. The challenge is to redefine the parameters of civil discourse in the new public sphere without restricting pluralism. Recent examples highlight the risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Despite the ominous headlines, the influence of fake news on political decision-making appears to be limited. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford says the reach of such content is largely restricted to groups of believers seeking to reinforce their own views and prejudices. But that does not make digital deception any less dangerous. Fake news feeds \u2014 and is fed \u00c2\u00adby \u2014polarisation, and, paradoxically, the more it is discussed, the more disruptive it becomes.</p><p>Fake news undermines trust in all forms of media and reinforces the view that it is impossible to discern fact from fiction. When people don't know what they can believe, journalists' ability to police the powerful is weakened. This trend will only worsen as \"deep-fake news\" \u2014 bogus images and videos that appear real \u2014 becomes more ubiquitous.</p><p>Clearly, the vulnerabilities of the digital public sphere must be addressed. Some argue that the solution is to block questionable websites or demote search results. Facebook, for example, censors duplicitous posts and has created an election \"war room\" to fight disinformation. Google and Twitter have considered similar steps, and all three are under pressure to give authorities access to the private data of users who publish fake news or make defamatory statements. But we believe that these steps are deeply misguided.</p><p>At the heart of any strong demo-cracy is a political consensus and arbitration that depends on the public's ability to debate and disagree. It is not up to private entities or public institutions to censor this process. Rather, we should strive to ensure that citizens have access to a broad array of opinions and ideas.</p><p>Freedom of expression and media freedom include the right to receive and impart information without interference. Studies show that most people prefer reliable and pluralistic news sources; the policymakers' job is to enable them to realise this preference.</p><p>A March 2018 report to the European Commission by the high-level group on fake news and online disinformation, which one of us (De Cock Buning) chaired, offered a roadmap, and the commission's recent action plan provides a good starting point. But more needs to be done.</p><p>There is no silver bullet to combat disinformation. Only multi-stakeholder approaches that spread responsibility across the news ecosystem, and take into account the fundamental rights involved, can provide adequate defences against disinformation.</p><p>For example, professional media must do more to guarantee the veracity of their coverage. Fact-checking technology can help, as long as it is kept free of political and economic influence.</p><p>Big Tech is starting to take responsibility by committing to a code of practice based on the 10 key principles from the high-level report. But Big Tech can contribute in other ways, for example by providing client-based interfaces for curating legitimate news, ensuring diversity in social media timelines, and prioritising the reposting of fact-checked information.</p><p>Platforms can also improve transparency in how they use data and code algorithms. Ideally, these algorithms should give consumers more control over editorial preferences and integrate editing and fact-checking applications developed by reliable media organisations.</p><p>Platforms must clearly identify news sources, especially paid political or commercial content. We also need more international collaboration and better jurisdictional rules to ensure that laws and regulations protect victims of fake and offensive news without restricting free speech or undermining the rights of whistle-blowers. These conflicts should not be legally settled where only one party has effective access to justice.</p><p>Platform companies should co-operate with schools, civil society groups and news organisations to strengthen public media literacy, to distinguish fake news from real.</p><p>Only consumers can marginalise fake news. We cannot allow private companies or governments to decide what people should know. The history of democracy is clear on this point: pluralism, not private or public censorship, is the best guarantor of truth. \u2014 \u00a9 Project Syndicate</p><p>Madeleine de Cock Buning was chair of the European Commission's high-level group on fake news and online disinformation.

And the problem is that 60 percent of Americans get their news through social media, mostly Facebook, which uses mysterious algorithms to customize each of our news feeds, selecting all and only what interests me, as computed from every time I press \"Like\" or forward an article to friends. It's not just Facebook. </p><p>Sit with a friend or, better yet, a friendly enemy \u2014 someone you know has political views contrary to your own \u2014 and, using your own devices, type the same entries into your respective Google search windows. Try \"BP,\" standing for the oil company that used to be British Petroleum but tried rebranding itself as Beyond Petroleum. You and your friendly enemy \u2014 perhaps your crackpot brother-in-law? \u2014 are going to get different results from your searches because of what Google knows about each of you and what you've searched before. If you are an avid environmentalist and he's a rabid lefty, you'll get more results about the environmental effects of the Deepwater Horizon disaster while he'll get more about its nefarious corporate causes.Trending Toward PersonalizationPersonalization has a long and illustrious history, best understood in contrast with its opposite, the mass market of the post-World War II boom. The structure of that marketplace featured mass production that reduced costs with economies of scale. The customer was a mass market that was only gradually differentiated, first by demographic characteristics \u2014 age, income and education \u2014 and later by psychographics such as likes, dislikes, values and personality traits. From 1983 until 1986, I served as the director of research for SRI International's Values and Lifestyles Program. Our clients were mostly marketers trying to match their messages about the right product for the right customer through the right media. As early as the 1980s, it became clear that this matching game \u2014 never an issue for mass markets \u2014 would only become finer-grained as technologies and media evolved. Demographic and psychographic segments would be sliced and diced into subsegments until finally, with the advent of the internet, we arrived at markets of one. As Farhad Manjoo describes the process in his book True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society:\"The mainstream is drying up. In some ways, we are returning to the freewheeling days before radio and television launched the very idea of mass media \u2014 the era of partisan newspapers and pamphleteers. But our niches, now, are more niche than ever before. We are entering what you might call the trillion-channel universe: over the last two decades, advances in technology have helped turn each of us into producers, distributors and editors of our own media diet.\"Personalization has its bright sides. It can make shopping easier: Instead of wandering aimlessly down the endless aisles of vast department stores, Amazon will guide you toward the book you might like next based on what it knows about your recent purchases. For the customer, personalization can mean that whatever messaging manages to reach her, she will not be subjected to blaring announcements to the mass market; the ads she receives will be about only the things she's interested in. They will be targeted. And that's what Facebook can sell to its advertisers: its success at solving the matching game; its ability to put in front of you, next to your news feed, all and only those things it knows you and your friends are interested in. Personalization reverses the polarity of the messaging in the marketplace. Instead of all push from producer to consumer, now it's pull from consumer to producer. Rather than passively listening to broadcasting from the networks, or narrowcasting from the cable channels, today's consumer is narrowcatching by pulling from the internet, via Google, whatever he or she wants to know.Politics and the Filter BubbleThanks to personalization, marketers and customers can find each other more easily. But what is good for the marketplace and the consumer is not necessarily good for the polity and its citizens, as Eli Pariser makes clear in his book The Filter Bubble: How the New Personalized Web Is Changing What We Read and How We Think.\"Ultimately, the filter bubble can affect your ability to choose how you want to live. To be the author of your life... you have to be aware of a diverse array of options and lifestyles. When you enter a filter bubble, you're letting the companies that construct it choose which options you're aware of. You may think you're the captain of your own destiny, but personalization can lead you down a road to a kind of informational determinism in which what you've clicked on in the past determines what you see next \u2014 a Web history you're doomed to repeat. You can get stuck in a static, ever-narrowing version of yourself \u2014 an endless you-loop.\"Founding head of MIT's Media Lab and columnist for Wired magazine Nicholas Negroponte put it this way:\"Imagine a future in which your interface agent can read every newswire and newspaper and catch every TV and radio broadcast on the planet, and then construct a personalized summary. This kind of newspaper is printed in an edition of one... Call it the Daily Me.\"From another authoritative source, Pariser quotes Google CEO Eric Schmidt:\"Most people will have personalized newsreading experiences on mobile-type devices that will largely replace their traditional reading of newspapers. And that kind of news consumption will be very personal, very targeted. It will remember what you know. It will suggest things that you might want to know. It will have advertising. Right? And it will be as convenient and fun as reading a traditional newspaper or magazine.\"But what is convenient and fun for the reader is not always good for the citizen. Pariser himself says: \"The filter bubble will often block out the things in our society that are important but complex or unpleasant. It renders them invisible. And it's not just the issues that disappear. Increasingly, it's the whole political process.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.financialsense.com/sites/default/files/users/u3521/images/2017/ogilvy-book-covers-101017.png\">https://www.financialsense.com/sites/default/files/users/u3521/images/2017/ogilvy-book-covers-101017.png</url> In a world that's becoming fragmented into friends of friends, \"the news\" becomes equally fragmented. In place of different views on the same world, people are living in different worlds. This ontological point is the main theme of Manjoo, who writes:\"While new technology eases connections between people, it also, paradoxically, facilitates a closeted view of the world, keeping us coiled tightly with those who share our ideas. In a world that lacks real gatekeepers and authority figures, and in which digital manipulation is so effortless, spin, conspiracy theories, myths, and outright lies may get the better of many of us.\"Unintended ConsequencesNow, this is not what the early inventors of and writers about the internet had in mind. Geniuses like Norbert Wiener, who helped invent cybernetics, and Douglas Engelbart, who invented the mouse, wanted to facilitate a more connected and friendly world. As Pariser describes what I'll call \"The Dream\" that united many of us in the San Francisco Bay Area during the lifetime of Wired magazine, \"Despite their libertarian orientation, the writings of Esther Dyson, John Perry Barlow, and Kevin Kelly... fairly ache with a longing to return to an egalitarian world.\" In his just-published World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech, Franklin Foer cites Kevin Kelly's description of the ultimate book, following on Google's digitization of all books: \"The real magic will come in the second act as each word in each book is cross-linked, clustered, cited, extracted, indexed, analyzed, annotated, remixed, reassembled and woven deeper into the culture than ever before.\" Foer, who was not so incidentally the editor of the New Republic, a left-wing publication by any measure, expostulates on The Dream:\"There was a political corollary to this prelapsarian dream. Not only would volumes melt into one beautiful book, disagreements would fade too As readers worked together to annotate and edit texts, they would find common ground. The path of the network takes our most contentious debates and leads them toward consensus. Facebook puts it this way: 'By enabling people from diverse backgrounds to easily connect and share their ideas, we can decrease world conflict in the short and long term.'\"But that's not exactly the way it's working out. As Fred Turner puts it in From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism:... \"to the degree that the libertarian rhetoric of self-reliance embraces a New Communalist vision of consciousness-centered, information-oriented elite, it can also permit a deep denial of the moral and material costs of the long-term shift toward network modes of production and ubiquitous computing.\"And further:\"Even as they suggested that such a world would in fact represent a return to a more natural, more intimate state of being, writers such as Kevin Kelly, Esther Dyson, and John Perry Barlow deprived their many readers of a language with which to think about the complex ways in which embodiment shapes all of human life, about the natural and social infrastructures on which that life depends, and about the effects that digital technologies and the network mode of production might have on life and its essential infrastructures.\"I think Turner is being a little rough on my friends and, after 32 years of crossing paths and working together in the San Francisco Bay area, I count each of them as a friend. But he has a point.Fixing a Network Gone WrongIs there a remedy for this network gone wrong? According to Foer, Pariser, Manjoo, and Turner, the internet has evolved from unifying force for social solidarity to a divisive bubble machine. Foer calls for a regulatory fix, a Data Protection Authority akin to Elizabeth Warren's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But reviewers give that idea little credibility. Foer's take on the current state of the news media veers from the apoplectic to the righteous:\"Google and Facebook are, after all, organizing the entire output of humanity. \"Of course, this is not an innocent activity \u2014 even though the tech companies disavow any responsibility for the material they publish and promote. They plead that they are mere platforms, neutral utilities for everyone's use and everyone's benefit. When Facebook was assailed for abetting the onslaught of false news stories during the 2016 presidential campaign Mark Zuckerberg initially disclaimed any culpability. 'Our goal is to give every person a voice,' he posted on Facebook, washing his hands of the matter. It's galling to watch Zuckerberg walk away from the catastrophic collapse of the news business and the degradation of American civic culture, because his site has played such a seminal role in both. Though Zuckerberg denies it, the process of guiding the public to information is a source of tremendous cultural and political power. In the olden days, we described that power as gatekeeping \u2014 and it was a sacred obligation.\"While often as critical as Foer when lamenting the way social media has evolved, Pariser is ultimately more optimistic when it comes to the future. He quotes one of the inventors of the internet:\"'We create the Web,' Sir Tim Berners-Lee wrote. 'We choose what properties we want it to have and not have. It is by no means finished (and it's certainly not dead).' It's still possible to build information systems that introduce us to new ideas, that push us in new ways. It's still possible to create media that show us what we don't know, rather than reflecting what we do. It's still possible to erect systems that don't trap us in an endless loop of self-flattery about our own interests or shield us from fields of inquiry that aren't our own.\"In the meantime, as an antidote to echo chambers like Fox News, MSNBC or Facebook's news feed, the four books cited in this column read like celebrations of the need for something like Stratfor.

The recommendation of a levy on social media platforms was made by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee three months ago, in a preliminary report following a multi-month investigation into the impact of so-called \u2018fake news\u2019 on democratic processes. Though it has suggested the terms \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018disinformation\u2019 be used instead, to better pin down exact types of problematic inauthentic content \u2014 and on that at least the government agrees. But just not on very much else. At least not yet. </p><p>Among around 50 policy suggestions in the interim report \u2014 which the committee put out quickly exactly to call for \u201curgent action\u201d to \u2018defend democracy\u2019 \u2014 it urged the government to put forward proposals for an education levy on social media. But in its response, released by the committee today, the government writes that it is \u201ccontinuing to build the evidence base on a social media levy to inform our approach in this area\u201d. \u201cWe are aware that companies and charities are undertaking a wide range of work to tackle online harms and would want to ensure we do not negatively impact existing work,\u201d it adds, suggesting it\u2019s most keen not to be accused of making a tricky problem worse. Earlier this year the government did announce plans to set up a dedicated national security unit to combat state-led disinformation campaigns, with the unit expected to monitor social media platforms to support faster debunking of online fakes \u2014 by being able to react more quickly to co-ordinated interference efforts by foreign states. But going a step further and requiring social media platforms themselves to pay a levy to fund domestic education programs \u2014 to arm citizens with critical thinking capabilities so people can more intelligently parse content being algorithmically pushed at them \u2014 is not, apparently, forming part of government\u2019s current thinking. Though it is not taking the idea of some form of future social media tax off the table entirely, as it continues seeking ways to make big tech pay a fairer share of earnings into the public purse, also noting in its response: \u201cWe will be considering any levy in the context of existing work being led by HM Treasury in relation to corporate tax and the digital economy.\u201d As a whole, the government\u2019s response to the DCMS committee\u2019s laundry list of policy recommendations around the democratic risks of online disinformation can be summed up in a word as \u2018cautious\u2019 \u2014 with only three of the report\u2019s forty-two recommendations being accepted outright, as the committee tells it, and four fully rejected. Most of the rest are being filed under \u2018come back later \u2014 we\u2019re still looking into it\u2019. So if you take the view that \u2018fake news\u2019 online has already had a tangible and worrying impact on democratic debate the government\u2019s response will come across as underwhelming and lacking in critical urgency. (Though it\u2019s hardly alone on that front.) The committee has reacted with disappointment \u2014 with chair Damian Collins dubbing the government response \u201cdisappointing and a missed opportunity\u201d, and also accusing ministers of hiding behind \u2018ongoing investigations\u2019 to avoid commenting on the committee\u2019s call that the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency urgently carry out its own investigation into \u201callegations involving a number of companies\u201d. Earlier this month Collins also called for the Met Police to explain why they had not opened an investigation into Brexit-related campaign spending breaches. It has also this month emerged that the force will not examine claims of Russian meddling in the referendum. Meanwhile the political circus and business uncertainty triggered by the Brexit vote goes on. The bulk of the government\u2019s response to the DCMS interim report entails flagging a number of existing and/or ongoing consultations and reviews \u2014 such as the \u2018Protecting the Debate: Intimidating, Influence and Information\u2018 consultation, which it launched this summer. But by saying it\u2019s continuing to gather evidence on a number of fronts the government is also saying it does not feel it\u2019s necessary to rush through any regulatory responses to technology-accelerated, socially divisive/politically sensitive viral nonsense \u2014 claiming also that it hasn\u2019t seen any evidence that malicious misinformation has been able to skew genuine democratic debate on the domestic front. It\u2019ll be music to Facebook\u2019s ears given the awkward scrutiny the company has faced from lawmakers at home and, indeed, elsewhere in Europe \u2014 in the wake of a major data misuse scandal with a deeply political angle. The government also points multiple times to a forthcoming oversight body which is in the process of being established \u2014 aka the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation \u2014 saying it expects this to grapple with a number of the issues of concern raised by the committee, such as ad transparency and targeting; and to work towards agreeing best practices in areas such as \u201ctargeting, fairness, transparency and liability around the use of algorithms and data-driven technologies\u201d. Identifying \u201cpotential new regulations\u201d is another stated role for the future body. Though given it\u2019s not yet actively grappling with any of these issues the UK\u2019s democratically concerned citizens are simply being told to wait. \u201cThe government recognises that as technological advancements are made, and the use of data and AI becomes more complex, our existing governance frameworks may need to be strengthened and updated. That is why we are setting up the Centre,\u201d the government writes, still apparently questioning whether legislative updates are needed \u2014 this in a response to the committee\u2019s call, informed by its close questioning of tech firms and data experts, for an oversight body to be able to audit \u201cnon-financial\u201d aspects of technology companies (including security mechanism and algorithms) to \u201censure they are operating responsibly\u201d. \u201cAs set out in the recent consultation on the Centre, we expect it to look closely at issues around the use of algorithms, such as fairness, transparency, and targeting,\u201d the government continues, noting that details of the body\u2019s initial work program will be published in the fall \u2014 when it says it will also put out its response to the aforementioned consultation. It does not specify when the ethics body will be in any kind of position to hit this shifty ground running. So again there\u2019s zero sense the government intends to act at a pace commensurate with the fast-changing technologies in question. Then, where the committee\u2019s recommendations touch on the work of existing UK oversight bodies, such as Competition and Markets Authority, the ICO data watchdog, the Electoral Commission and the National Crime Agency, the government dodges specific concerns by suggesting it\u2019s not appropriate for it to comment \u201con independent bodies or ongoing investigations\u201d. Also notable: It continues to reject entirely the idea that Russian-backed disinformation campaigns have had any impact on domestic democratic processes at all \u2014 despite public remarks by prime minister Theresa May last year generally attacking Putin for weaponizing disinformation for election interference purposes. Instead it writes:  We want to reiterate, however, that the Government has not seen evidence of successful use of disinformation by foreign actors, including Russia, to influence UK democratic processes. But we are not being complacent and the Government is actively engaging with partners to develop robust policies to tackle this issue. Its response on this point also makes no reference of the extensive use of social media platforms to run political ads targeting the 2016 Brexit referendum. Nor does it make any note of the historic lack of transparency of such ad platforms. Which means that it\u2019s simply not possible to determine where all the ad money came from to fund digital campaigning on domestic issues \u2014 with Facebook only just launching a public repository of who is paying for political ads and badging them as such in the UK, for example. The elephant in the room is of course that \u2018lack of evidence\u2019 is not necessarily evidence of a lack of success, especially when it\u2019s so hard to extract data from opaque adtech platforms in the first place. Moreover, just this week fresh concerns have been raised about how platforms like Facebook are still enabling dark ads to target political messages at citizens \u2014 without it being transparently clear who is actually behind and paying for such campaigns\u2026 In turn triggering calls from opposition MPs for updates to UK election law\u2026 Yet the government, busily embroiled as it still is with trying to deliver some kind of Brexit outcome, is seemingly unconcerned by all this unregulated, background ongoing political advertising. It also directly brushes off the committee\u2019s call for it to state how many investigations are currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics, saying only that it has taken steps to ensure there is a \u201ccoordinated structure across all relevant UK authorities to defend against hostile foreign interference in British politics, whether from Russia or any other State\u201d, before reiterating: \u201cThere has, however, been no evidence to date of any successful foreign interference.\u201d This summer the Electoral Commission found that the official Vote Leave campaign in the UK\u2019s in/out EU referendum had broken campaign spending rules \u2014 with social media platforms being repurposed as the unregulated playing field where election law could be diddled at such scale. That much is clear. The DCMS committee had backed the Commission\u2019s call for digital imprint requirements for electronic campaigns to level the playing field between digital and print ads. However the government has failed to back even that pretty uncontroversial call, merely pointing again to a public consultation (which ends today) on proposed changes to electoral law. So it\u2019s yet more wait and see. The committee is also disappointed about the lack of government response to its call for the Commission to establish a code for advertising through social media during election periods; and its recommendation that \u201cFacebook and other platforms take responsibility for the way their platforms are used\u201d \u2014 noting also the government made \u201cno response to Facebook\u2019s failure to respond adequately to the Committee\u2019s inquiry and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s reluctance to appear as a witness\u201c. (A reluctance that really enraged the committee.) In a statement on the government\u2019s response, committee chair Damian Collins writes: \u201cThe government\u2019s response to our interim report on disinformation and \u2018fake news\u2019 is disappointing and a missed opportunity. It uses other ongoing investigations to further delay desperately needed announcements on the ongoing issues of harmful and misleading content being spread through social media. \u201cWe need to see a more coordinated approach across government to combat campaigns of disinformation being organised by Russian agencies seeking to disrupt and undermine our democracy. The government\u2019s response gives us no real indication of what action is being taken on this important issue.\u201d Collins finds one slender crumb of comfort, though, that the government might have some appetite to rule big tech. After the committee had called for government to \u201cdemonstrate how seriously it takes Facebook\u2019s apparent collusion in spreading disinformation in Burma, at the earliest opportunity\u201d, the government writes that it: \u201chas made it clear to Facebook, and other social media companies, that they must do more to remove illegal and harmful content\u201d; and noting also that its forthcoming Online Harms White Paper will include \u201ca range of policies to tackle harmful content\u201d. \u201cWe welcome though the strong words from the Government in its demand for action by Facebook to tackle the hate speech that has contributed to the ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya in Burma,\u201d notes Collins, adding: \u201cWe will be looking for the government to make progress on these and other areas in response to our final report which will be published in December. \u201cWe will also be raising these issues with the Secretary of State for DCMS, Jeremy Wright, when he gives evidence to the Committee on Wednesday this week.\u201d (Wright being the new minister in charge of the UK\u2019s digital brief, after Matt Hancock moved over to health.) We\u2019ve reached out to Facebook for comment on the government\u2019s call for a more robust approach to illegal hate speech. Update: A company spokesperson has now emailed the following statement: \u201cThe Committee has raised important issues and we\u2019re committed to working with Government to make the UK the safest place to be online. Transparency around political advertising is good for democracy, and good for the electoral process and we\u2019re pleased the Government welcomed our recent new tools to ensure that political ads on Facebook are open for public scrutiny. We also share the Committee\u2019s concern to keep harmful content off Facebook and have doubled the number of people working on safety and security to 20,000 globally.\u201d Last week the company announced it had hired former UK deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, to be its new head of global policy and comms \u2014 apparently signalling a willingness to pay a bit more attention to European regulators. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN929268920181023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJH-PR91-DXCW-D3TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2257\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 23, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

In the past decade alone, investors who backed the winners of the day - from big tech to the broader US equity market - have made substantial gains by simply continuing to do so. This extends to some of the UK's most popular active fund managers: Terry Smith and Nick Train are just two names that have made loyal supporters substantially better off over the years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But any support for the darlings of active management comes with strings attached: much of it is predicated on the idea that investors can get out of a fund as easily as they got in if things go awry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nearly six months on from the suspension of the Woodford Equity Income fund, private investors who stuck with the UK's best-known active manager are counting the cost of their loyalty - even now it still remains uncertain how much money will be recovered once the flagship fund starts winding up in 2020. The Woodford affair has cast a huge shadow over the investment industry, raising questions about trust, transparency and regulation. But it's an episode that could also help the industry, and investors themselves, avoid future mistakes.</p><p>                     Star falling                   </p><p>Neil Woodford spent decades making his customers much wealthier as a manager at Invesco. A UK large-cap investor with a contrarian bent, he weathered both the dotcom bust and the financial crash by avoiding crowded trades that later proved calamitous. So it was no surprise that when he went solo, launching Woodford Investment Management (WIM), he did so to great fanfare. The firm would run around \u00a314bn in assets at its peak, with the Woodford Equity Income (GB00BLRZQ406) fund at one point holding more than \u00a310bn.</p><p>Initially the main fund, which launched in June 2014, extended a long streak of enviable performance. It returned 16.2 per cent in 2015, vastly outstripping a rise of less than 1 per cent in the FTSE All-Share. Mr Woodford built on his success by launching two more funds: the Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT), which floated in 2015 in what remains one of the sector's most successful initial public offerings (IPOs), and the yield-oriented Woodford Income Focus fund, which arrived in 2017.</p><p>But by 2017 problems had set in. Woodford Equity Income was beset by stock-specific challenges, from the time shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial (PFG) lost two-thirds of their value in a single day to issues at AstraZeneca (AZN). The fund returned just 0.79 per cent that year, while Patient Capital's share price also struggled.</p><p>Performance would not pick up. 2017 saw Mr Woodford stay true to his contrarian roots, making a shift towards more cyclical UK stocks such as Lloyds (LLOY) in the belief that the domestic economy was due a strong comeback. A combination of stock-specific problems and the continued underperformance of domestic-facing sectors saw Woodford Equity Income make double-digit losses in the following two years.</p><p>Periodic poor performance is a fact of life for many active managers, but other factors were at work. While Mr Woodford's listed equity holdings struggled, a chunk of assets invested in unlisted stocks - something highly unusual in an equity income fund - started to represent a worryingly large part of the portfolio. The fund started bumping up against a 10 per cent limit on unquoted holdings, applied as part of the 'undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities' (Ucits) rules that govern a broad swathe of funds sold in the UK.</p><p>With the Equity Income fund performing badly and investors starting to grow concerned, outflows racked up. As the table below shows, inflows that had run into the billions went into reverse from 2017.</p><p>                     Woodford Equity Income: estimated net fund flows                   </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"384\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Net flow</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2014</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a34.1bn</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2015</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a33.2bn</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2016</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a31bn</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2017</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(\u00a31.3bn)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2018</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(\u00a32.4bn)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2019*</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(\u00a3684m)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>                     Source: Morningstar. *2019 figures apply to flows until June suspensionThis created fresh pressure points for the fund. Some unquoted names did pay off handsomely: Woodford Investment Management offloaded its stake in broker AJ Bell (AJB) before its 2018 IPO, for example.But because the unquoted holdings generally remained difficult to sell quickly, Mr Woodford would have to sell more liquid stocks as a way of returning cash to redeeming investors. This was not helped by the poor performance of the fund, because any drop in the overall value of the liquid holdings threatened to boost the fund's allocation to unquoted stocks.Meena Lakshmanan, partner at wealth manager LGT Vestra, argues that the Woodford strategy went against conventional wisdom, exacerbating his troubles.\"If you have redemptions you need to sell your most illiquid position, not your liquid positions,\" she says.Mr Woodford found himself struggling to stay within the 10 per cent limit on unquoted stocks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has since noted that it was in touch with the fund's authorised corporate director (ACD), Link Fund Services, in February and March 2018 because of two occasions where the limit was breached.Come 2019 and Mr Woodford was taking increasingly desperate measures to stay within this limit. In March, he transferred around \u00a373m of unquoted assets - via stakes in Atom Bank, Carrick Therapeutics, Cell Medica, RateSetter and Spin Memory - from the Equity Income fund to the Patient Capital trust, in exchange for the trust's shares.The extreme measures did not end there. Later that same month, it emerged that Mr Woodford had listed some of his unquoted stocks on The International Stock Exchange in Guernsey. This move was widely criticised among industry commentators - and later by the FCA - and Guernsey would later suspend the stocks.  Fund managers and other professional investors have been busy assessing how liquidity stacks up in their portfolios Abi Reilly, managing consultant at Bovill, a consultancy focusing on finance regulation, warns that such moves only served to obscure the difficulties at hand. \"He used clever techniques to make something look like a duck, but it was a dog with a plastic beak,\" she says.According to data provided to the FCA, around a third of the fund's assets would have taken at least 181 days to sell, as of the end of April 2019. And with a decent chunk of the fund proving difficult to liquidate, redemptions would soon become too great to contend with. The FCA notes that in May 2019, net outflows averaged 1 per cent of the fund's assets a week. But this escalated at the end of the month, as Kent County Council's pension scheme opted to withdraw its investment of around \u00a3250m.\"The redemption requests on 31 May and 3 June amounted to \u00a3296m, representing 8.6 per cent of net assets, with the fund holding no cash at the time,\" the FCA said.While the fund's ACD, Link, initially hoped to sell enough assets to meet investor redemptions and reopen the fund in early December 2019, it ultimately dubbed this an unrealistic goal, opting instead to wind the fund up and return cash to investors. In mid October, with Link having withdrawn the fund from his control and Patient Capital's board openly considering a change of investment manager, Mr Woodford served notice on his remaining two funds and took the \"highly painful\" decision to close WIM.Investors at least have some clarity about what will happen with their money: Woodford Equity Income starts winding up next year, although some calculations suggest investors will only get a small fraction of their money back. Patient Capital's shareholders have greater hope, in the form of a new investment manager. But it faces significant challenges - as the smaller Income Focus fund will if it is taken over by a new firm, an option currently under consideration.The falloutNo single issue can explain the Woodford episode. Poor performance in the main fund led many to ultimately rush for the door, and redemptions were partly so great because so many had invested in the first place. This was testament to Mr Woodford's stellar track record - it is likely that many investors held on for so long because the manager had found himself out of favour more than once before, only to strongly outperform his peers in the end. However, Mr Woodford's spectacular rise and fall will have far-ranging effects for active managers and those using them.Some of these problems can and will be addressed, but the Woodford fiasco has made it obvious how poorly equipped open-ended funds are to hold unquoted investments, due to the inherent liquidity mismatch involved (see 'How does fund liquidity work?' below).How does fund liquidity workInvestors who choose to sell an open-ended fund are normally entitled to exchange their units in said fund for cash, and these funds tend to offer this on a daily basis. But this becomes a problem with equities that are unquoted and other illiquid assets, because of the mismatch between how long it takes to sell these and the speed with which a fund promises money back to investors. Because these assets cannot be sold quickly, and often cannot be sold for a significant period of time, they clog up the system when a fund is subjected to significant redemption requests.Investment managers can be forced to sell their more liquid names, which can increase the proportion of assets they have in illiquids. Managers may also be forced to sell some of their winners. This, and a regulatory direction of travel that may see open-ended funds suspend trading more often, means private investors run a bigger risk of getting trapped in a fund. These concerns are not limited to unquoted stocks: the investment universe is rife with other illiquid assets, many of which are much more common in open-ended funds. Direct property investments are a good example. Fears about liquidity in the property space looked well-founded earlier this month, when the \u00a32.5bn M&amp;G Property Portfolio fund <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/funds-news/2019/12/04/m-g-suspends-2-5bn-property-fund-amid-brexit-woes/&#34; title=&#34;\">suspended trading</url> amid \"unusually high and sustained outflows\". Several open-ended property funds       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/funds-news/2019/12/04/m-g-suspends-2-5bn-property-fund-amid-brexit-woes/&#34; title=&#34;\">temporarily suspended trading</url> in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit vote.Elsewhere, corporate bonds are often the subject of concern. High-yield debt is particularly vulnerable to a drying up of liquidity, some argue.Smaller listed equities are also a cause for concern, and some UK small-cap investors now run substantial levels of money: four of the funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies peer group run more than \u00a31bn in assets. While not a guarantee of limited capacity, it is worth scrutinising. Large positions in smaller listed equities can be difficult to liquidate without hitting their share prices, as holders of Woodford's holdings will have felt (see the table at the end of this article).Elsewhere, an MSCI analysis looking at a sample of large Ucits equity funds found that while the vast majority were very liquid, seven names had more than 15 per cent of assets in illiquid holdings. And Morningstar, the fund ratings agency, recently downgraded Invesco manager and Woodford protege Mark Barnett's funds in part because of liquidity concerns.As such it is worth monitoring how big funds are getting when they focus on less liquid assets, and what an investment firm's view on the underlying liquidity is. Fund firms should, at least, be more forthright on such issues in the wake of the Woodford scandal.Both the investment industry and the regulator have been spurred into action. Fund managers and other professional investors have been busy assessing how liquidity stacks up in their portfolios.Those open-ended funds that do still hold unquoted stocks have started to retreat from this area, or at least talk more openly about liquidity management: small and mid-cap funds run by Merian Global Investors sold unlisted stocks to its Merian Chrysalis (MERI) investment trust earlier this year. In the case of Mr Barnett, unquoted investments make up around 5 per cent of assets in his funds, but the manager has argued that liquidity in these portfolios remains strong.Others who hold unlisted stocks in open-ended funds are few and far between: Merian's UK Dynamic fund, for example, had a 4.9 per cent weighting to unlisted companies at the end of October, but this is far from the industry norm. Meanwhile, industry bodies have looked for solutions to the liquidity mismatch: the Investment Association (IA), a trade body for asset managers, has proposed a \"long-term investment fund\", which could hold illiquid assets but move away from daily dealing.The FCA has also been busy. Its policy paper on illiquid assets in open-ended funds, whose publication was delayed to consider the implications of the Woodford affair, set out requirements for certain open-ended funds, including some popular property offerings, to suspend trading when there is \"material uncertainty\" around the value of illiquid holdings.Other measures could yet emerge: Andrew Bailey, the FCA's chief executive, has suggested greater scrutiny around professional fund buy lists, for example. Given that many professional investors had fled the Woodford fund well before its suspension, from discretionary fund managers to pension funds, he has also revived an old idea of splitting retail and institutional assets. Meanwhile, the FCA and Bank of England are carrying out a joint probe into the risks of holding illiquid assets in open-ended funds.Moving forwardAll of this could spell a solution. But for many in the industry it falls short of requirements. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at AJ Bell, describes the FCA's decision not to apply its latest rules to Ucits funds - a large chunk of the open-ended universe - as \"a missed opportunity\". He also believes the regulator faces an uphill struggle in changing the behaviour of investors.\"The rules could mean funds suspend more frequently,\" he says. \"They are trying to take away the stigma of suspensions. The FCA is saying it's in your interests to suspend, but that's really hard to sell to investors, even if it's right.\"Similar limits apply to any fund providers looking to remove the liquidity mismatch in open-ended funds, because asset managers are likely to receive sharp treatment if they abandon daily dealing.\"The problem with daily dealing is that for a fund group, there's no first-mover advantage to changing from daily dealing to monthly dealing,\" Mr Hughes explains. \"If you are the lone voice saying that, you can guarantee that people will just switch out of that fund to something that's daily dealing, because they like the option of that access. If we want movement on daily dealing the only thing that will happen is from the regulator.\"Responses to the IA's idea of a long-term asset fund give credence to his concerns. Interactive Investor, the platform, argued at the time the idea was initially mooted that investors should receive some additional benefit in exchange for less frequent dealing.Investors have long wish lists when it comes to tackling the liquidity mismatch. This includes the regular publication of a fund's liquidity profile, detailing how long each portion of assets would take to sell. Another solution would be for the regulator, and investors themselves, to take a closer look at a fund's capacity, or how much money it can run before liquidity pressures come to bear. The more money you allocate to one fund or name, the more risk you heap onto your portfolio When a fund becomes too big -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/funds-news/2019/12/04/m-g-suspends-2-5bn-property-fund-amid-brexit-woes/&#34; title=&#34;\">a subject we discussed in the summer</url> - it can struggle to establish worthwhile positions without owning too much of an asset. In the equity world, this can mean a fund manager inadvertently moving the price - something Mr Woodford has arguably done on both his good and bad days.Fund managers can take measures to stem the inflow of money, from levying initial charges on new investors to simply dialing back marketing efforts. But Andrew Gilbert, investment manager at Parmenion, believes the FCA and regulator should take a \"stronger view\" on capacity, with limits on both fund sizes and the workload of investment managers.\"If a manager is well known and everyone buys into them as a star manager, the company launches more funds for them to run. From an investor's perspective, if that fund had that track record over 10 years but just on one product and now they run 10, clearly they will be more distracted,\" he says. \"We need more firm boundaries around capacity and the number of mandates they can run.\"Ben Conway, of Hawksmoor Investment Management, argues that a problem lies in funds managers' commercial objectives and how these run counter to those of underlying investors. Because asset managers charge fees on the level of assets they run, it makes sense to allow funds to grow even if this can create issues. He believes investors should look beyond blockbuster open-ended funds.\"The more illiquid the asset class, the more likely you should use an investment trust,\" he says. \"If you have to go open-ended, pick a small fund.\"However, investment trusts are not without their own problems, as outlined in the box below ('Can investors reduce liquidity risk by using ETFs and investment trusts?', while smaller open-ended funds could charge higher fees and even struggle to survive. Ultimately investors will need to accept that any illiquidity premium they receive is there for a reason.\"What you need to understand if you want to invest is that when you buy illiquid assets for a greater return, there's a trade-off, and that trade-off is access,\" says Mr Hughes.Patience can also pay off at times: funds run by hlO Asset Management, for example, were subject to liquidity concerns and investor redemptions earlier this year because of esoteric fixed-income holdings. But the funds successfully sold down these positions and never had to suspend trading.Not all cases of suspension have ended in disaster, either. Open-ended property funds successfully reopened after their 2016 suspension, for example. But come difficult markets, risks remain.\"When you get a bear market, selling \u00a31 of bonds will still be as hard as selling \u00a310m,\" says Mr Conway. \"When there's no bid in the market, there's no bid in the market.\"Can investors reduce liquidity risk by using ETFs and investment trusts?Investment trusts are one popular route into less liquid assets: because a trust's shares are traded, it is not forced to give investors their money back if they wish to walk away. As noted, this is the main way many investors access illiquid assets and can give all parties involved a longer-term outlook.That said, there is no silver bullet because investors have to take share price risk. They could see strong performers languishing on discounts or popular trusts looking too expensive if shares perform well - infrastructure trusts, for example, have recently tended to sit on a large premium to the value of their underlying assets. This means that if a trust is deeply out of favour, any investor determined to sell up can only do so by accepting the current price and potentially crystallising a loss.Woodford Patient Capital is a good example of this: Woodford's decision to resign from the trust sent shares to a 50 per cent discount to the trust's net asset value.Ms Lakshmanan adds that it can be difficult to trade trusts on platforms. As a result, trusts are becoming \"smaller and less liquid\", which can cause problems for those trading them.ETFs can be easy to trade in and out of, but carry the same risks. There are also concerns that the sheer weight of money now sitting in ETFs could lead to heightened volatility in tough markets.  Why are funds holding more unquotedsThe Woodford debacle means that those few open-ended funds holding unquoted assets are much less likely to do so in future. But with fewer companies listing on public markets, asset managers are increasingly getting involved in unquoted equities via other routes. This gives investors access to young, high-growth companies - but liquidity concerns mean the action will mainly take place in the investment trust space.There are already plenty of private equity offerings, but the early success of one new entrant illustrates the extent of investor demand. Merian Chrysalis has raised a significant chunk of money in its first year of existence.Other private assets are also luring investors in. The Investment Association noted in 2018 that asset managers were increasingly focusing on areas such as direct lending, as well as real assets such as infrastructure. This exposure can offer good yields and a form of diversification against moves in public markets.Secondary fundraising - or money raised by existing investment trusts - came to a record amount, of \u00a34bn, in the first half of 2019, with much of this down to demand for real assets. Trusts focusing on renewable energy infrastructure raised \u00a31.1bn.  Why Kent County Council pulled its cash from WoodfordMany professional investors had already withdrawn from the Equity Income fund before its suspension. Kent County Council's pension scheme remained invested despite some reservations - but the speed with which the fund was shrinking prompted it to look for the exit.In a March 2019 meeting, the council's superannuation fund committee had resolved to reconsider the merits of its Woodford holding at another meeting, in late June. In the meantime the committee was set to have an unrelated update on the scheme's investment strategy at the end of May. But in the run-up to the end of May meeting the Woodford fund shrank by another \u00a3560m on the back of redemptions and poor performance.\"The committee resolved unanimously that the council should seek to redeem the investment with immediate effect and should not wait until 21 June,\" a Kent County Council spokesman said. \"Consequently, steps were taken to make the necessary arrangements to redeem the investment on Monday 3 June. The announcement on Monday that trading in the investment fund was suspended was not anticipated.\"  Is this the end of the road for superstar managers?Fund firms with 'star' managers have long faced the risk that assets will follow these employees out of the door if they depart. Because of this, many asset managers have already been moving to more team-based approaches in recent years, as well as lining up potential successors for popular managers and clearly telegraphing the retirement plans of older star names. The Woodford debacle is likely to accelerate this shift, something Parmenion's Andrew Gilbert welcomes.\"Your star fund manager had a degree of credibility and respect that people gave them the benefit of the doubt,\" he explains. \"There's less of that going around now. It's making it more quantitative and qualitative and taking out the emotional bias of individuals.\"I would emphasise the importance of the team. There's a tendency to ascribe the success of a fund to one individual, but it's an individual in a specific team and a specific company and a specific environment. You can't ascribe that past performance to them in future.\"But some worry that, with running funds becoming more expensive, the Woodford fiasco has tarnished the name of active management and, with it, made it harder for talented managers to start their own businesses.\"An issue is the potential risk and the lack of innovation in the industry,\" says Jake Moeller, head of Lipper UK and Ireland research for Refinitiv. \"It's very difficult for a boutique fund house to get off the ground. We are talking about ones that don't have the goodwill of Woodford. Investors could think 'Woodford couldn't pull this off, so why would I back a small boutique?'\"  A protection checklist for investorsIt's entirely possible that new fund management scandals will emerge in the future. Investors will need to keep abreast of the regulatory developments as outlined in this article. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help make sure you are not caught:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Choose the right vehicle. If you plan to invest in holdings that have a strong tendency to illiquidity such as private equity/unlisted companies or an asset class such as property, make sure you choose an appropriate vehicle. By choosing to invest in these types of holdings via closed-ended funds (investment trusts) and ETFs, you might have a better chance of an escape route because you should be able to sell your shares on the market. You might still suffer a loss, but you will not be locked into a fund at the mercy of the fund manager. However, see our box above on the risks of closed-ended vehicles.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Pay attention to liquidity. Before you buy, carefully read the fund sheet to understand exactly what you are investing in and what the mix of assets is. Train yourself to spot areas of illiquidity - for example, holdings that have an 'estimated value' rather than a market value. This is not to say that you shouldn't hold any illiquid investments, just that you should be prepared to stay invested for the long term.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Don't write off active fund managers but don't allow yourself to be dazzled by the 'stars'. The more money you allocate to one fund or name, the more risk you heap onto your portfolio. Diversify across fund managers just as you would across geographies and sectors.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-58439636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNP-21V1-F021-619V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4203\"/><timeReceived>11:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002L6S</classCode><className>ASTRAZENECA PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YM8</classCode><className>INVESCO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>AZN (STO)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>AZN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>AZN (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>IVZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N525910GG</classCode><className>MUTUAL FUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N523930MC</classCode><className>INVESTMENT ADVISERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODQ2M0Q5NUExRUZENEY2NDkzMzlDMDVFNjFCNTY3MTQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc</classCode><className>Investment Advisers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N523920MM</classCode><className>INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

In the past decade alone, investors who backed the winners of the day - from big tech to the broader US equity market - have made substantial gains by simply continuing to do so. This extends to some of the UK's most popular active fund managers: Terry Smith and Nick Train are just two names that have made loyal supporters substantially better offover the years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But any support for the darlings of active management comes with strings attached: much of it is predicated on the idea that investors can get out of a fund as easily as they got in if things go awry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nearly six months on from the suspension of the Woodford Equity Income fund, private investors who stuck with the UK's best-known active manager are counting the cost of their loyalty - even now it still remains uncertain how much money will be recovered once the flagship fund starts winding up in 2020. The Woodford affair has cast a huge shadow over the investment industry, raising questions about trust, transparency and regulation. But it's an episode that could also help the industry, and investors themselves, avoid future mistakes.</p><p>Star falling Neil Woodford spent decades making his customers much wealthier as a manager at Invesco. A UK large-cap investor with a contrarian bent, he weathered both the dotcom bust and the financial crash by avoiding crowded trades that later proved calamitous. So it was no surprise that when he went solo, launching Woodford Investment Management (WIM), he did so to great fanfare. The firm would run around \u00a314bn in assets at its peak, with the Woodford Equity Income (GB00BLRZQ406) fund at one point holding more than \u00a310bn.</p><p>Initially the main fund, which launched in June 2014, extended a long streak of enviable performance. It returned 16.2 per cent in 2015, vastly outstripping a rise of less than 1 per cent in the FTSE All-Share. Mr Woodford built on his success by launching two more funds: the Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT), which floated in 2015 in what remains one of the sector's most successful initial public offerings (IPOs), and the yield-oriented Woodford Income Focus fund, which arrived in 2017.</p><p>But by 2017 problems had set in. Woodford Equity Income was beset by stock-specific challenges, from the time shares in doorstep lender Provident Financial (PFG) lost two-thirds of their value in a single day to issues at AstraZeneca (AZN). The fund returned just 0.79 per cent that year, while Patient Capital's share price also struggled.</p><p>Performance would not pick up. 2017 saw Mr Woodford stay true to his contrarian roots, making a shift towards more cyclical UK stocks such as Lloyds (LLOY) in the belief that the domestic economy was due a strong comeback. A combination of stock-specific problems and the continued underperformance of domestic-facing sectors saw Woodford Equity Income make double-digit losses in the following two years.</p><p>Periodic poor performance is a fact of life for many active managers, but other factors were at work. While Mr Woodford's listed equity holdings struggled, a chunk of assets invested in unlisted stocks - something highly unusual in an equity income fund - started to represent a worryingly large part of the portfolio. The fund started bumping up against a 10 per cent limit on unquoted holdings, applied as part of the 'undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities' (Ucits) rules that govern a broad swathe of funds sold in the UK.</p><p>With the Equity Income fund performing badly and investors starting to grow concerned, outflows racked up. As Table 1 shows, inflows that had run into the billions went into reverse from 2017.</p><p>This created fresh pressure points for the fund. Some unquoted names did pay offhandsomely: Woodford Investment Management offloaded its stake in broker AJ Bell (AJB) before its 2018 IPO, for example.</p><p>But because the unquoted holdings generally remained difficult to sell quickly, Mr Woodford would have to sell more liquid stocks as a way of returning cash to redeeming investors. This was not helped by the poor performance of the fund, because any drop in the overall value of the liquid holdings threatened to boost the fund's allocation to unquoted stocks.</p><p>Meena Lakshmanan, partner at wealth manager LGT Vestra, argues that the Woodford strategy went against conventional wisdom, exacerbating his troubles. \"If you have redemptions you need to sell your most illiquid position, not your liquid positions,\" she says.</p><p>Mr Woodford found himself struggling to stay within the 10 per cent limit on unquoted stocks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has since noted that it was in touch with the fund's authorised corporate director (ACD), Link Fund Services, in February and March 2018 because of two occasions where the limit was breached.</p><p>Come 2019 and Mr Woodford was taking increasingly desperate measures to stay within this limit. In March, he transferred around \u00a373m of unquoted assets - via stakes in Atom Bank, Carrick Therapeutics, Cell Medica, RateSetter and Spin Memory - from the Equity Income fund to the Patient Capital Trust, in exchange for the trust's shares.</p><p>The extreme measures did not end there. Later that same month, it emerged that Mr Woodford had listed some of his unquoted stocks on The International Stock Exchange in Guernsey. This move was widely criticised among industry commentators - and later by the FCA - and Guernsey would later suspend the stocks.</p><p>Abi Reilly, managing consultant at Bovill, a consultancy focusing on finance regulation, warns that such moves only served to obscure the difficulties at hand. \"He used clever techniques to make something look like a duck, but it was a dog with a plastic beak,\" she says.</p><p>According to data provided to the FCA, around a third of the fund's assets would have taken at least 181 days to sell, as of the end of April 2019. And with a decent chunk of the fund proving difficult to liquidate, redemptions would soon become too great to contend with. The FCA notes that in May 2019, net outflows averaged 1 per cent of the fund's assets a week. But this escalated at the end of the month, as Kent County Council's pension scheme opted to withdraw its investment of around \u00a3250m.</p><p>\"The redemption requests on 31 May and 3 June amounted to \u00a3296m, representing 8.6 per cent of net assets, with the fund holding no cash at the time,\" the FCA said.</p><p>While the fund's ACD, Link, initially hoped to sell enough assets to meet investor redemptions and reopen the fund in early December 2019, it ultimately dubbed this an unrealistic goal, opting instead to wind the fund up and return cash to investors. In mid October, with Link having withdrawn the fund from his control and Patient Capital's board openly considering a change of investment manager, Mr Woodford served notice on his remaining two funds and took the \"highly painful\" decision to close WIM.</p><p>Investors at least have some clarity about what will happen with their money: Woodford Equity Income starts winding up next year, although some calculations suggest investors will only get a small fraction of their money back. Patient Capital's shareholders have greater hope, in the form of a new investment manager. But it faces significant challenges - as the smaller Income Focus fund will if it is taken over by a new firm, an option currently under consideration.</p><p>The fallout No single issue can explain the Woodford episode. Poor performance in the main fund led many to ultimately rush for the door, and redemptions were partly so great because so many had invested in the first place. This was testament to Mr Woodford's stellar track record - it is likely that many investors held on for so long because the manager had found himself out of favour more than once before, only to strongly outperform his peers in the end. However, Mr Woodford's spectacular rise and fall will have far-ranging effects for active managers and those using them.</p><p>Some of these problems can and will be addressed, but the Woodford fiasco has made it obvious how poorly equipped open-ended funds are to hold unquoted investments, due to the inherent liquidity mismatch involved (see 'How does fund liquidity work?' on page 27).</p><p>These concerns are not limited to unquoted stocks: the investment universe is rife with other illiquid assets, many of which are much more common in open-ended funds. Direct property investments are a good example, as are corporate bonds. In the property space, recent liquidity concerns seemed well-founded when the M&amp;G Property Portfolio (GB00B89X8P64) suspended trading amid \"unusually high and sustained outflows\" this month. High-yield debt is particularly vulnerable to a drying up of liquidity, some argue.</p><p>Smaller listed equities are also a cause for concern, and some UK small-cap investors now run substantial levels of money: four of the funds in the IA UK Smaller Companies peer group run more than \u00a31bn in assets. While not a guarantee of limited capacity, it is worth scrutinising. Large positions in smaller listed equities can be difficult to liquidate without hitting their share prices, as holders of Woodford's holdings will have felt (see page 31).</p><p>Elsewhere, an MSCI analysis looking at a sample of large Ucits equity funds found that while the vast majority were very liquid, seven names had more than 15 per cent of assets in illiquid holdings. And Morningstar, the fund ratings agency, recently downgraded Invesco manager and Woodford prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Mark Barnett's funds in part because of liquidity concerns.</p><p>As such it is worth monitoring how big funds are getting when they focus on less liquid assets, and what an investment firm's view on the underlying liquidity is. Fund firms should, at least, be more forthright on such issues in the wake of the Woodford scandal.</p><p>Both the investment industry and the regulator have been spurred into action. Fund managers and other professional investors have been busy assessing how liquidity stacks up in their portfolios.</p><p>Those open-ended funds that do still hold unquoted stocks have started to retreat from this area, or at least talk more openly about liquidity management: small and mid-cap funds run by Merian Global Investors sold unlisted stocks to its Merian Chrysalis (MERI) investment trust earlier this year. In the case of Mr Barnett, unquoted investments make up around 5 per cent of assets in his funds, but the manager has argued that liquidity in these portfolios remains strong.</p><p>Others who hold unlisted stocks in open-ended funds are few and far between: Merian's UK Dynamic fund, for example, had a 4.9 per cent weighting to unlisted companies at the end of October, but this is far from the industry norm. Meanwhile, industry bodies have looked for solutions to the liquidity mismatch: the Investment Association (IA), a trade body for asset managers, has proposed a \"long-term investment fund\", which could hold illiquid assets but move away from daily dealing.</p><p>The FCA has also been busy. Its policy paper on illiquid assets in open-ended funds, whose publication was delayed to consider the implications of the Woodford affair, set out requirements for certain open-ended funds, including some popular property Why are funds holding more unquoteds? The Woodford debacle means that those few open-ended funds holding unquoted assets are much less likely to do so in future. But with fewer companies listing on public markets, asset managers are increasingly getting involved in unquoted equities via other routes. This gives investors access to young, high-growth companies - but liquidity concerns mean the action will mainly take place in the investment trust space.</p><p>There are already plenty of private equity offerings, but the early success of one new entrant illustrates the extent of investor demand. Merian Chrysalis has raised a significant chunk of money in its first year of existence. Other private assets are also luring investors in.</p><p>The Investment Association noted in 2018 that asset managers were increasingly focusing on areas such as direct lending, as well as real assets such as infrastructure.</p><p>This exposure can offer good yields and a form of diversification against moves in public markets.</p><p>Secondary fundraising - or money raised by existing investment trusts - came to a record amount, of \u00a34bn, in the first half of 2019, with much of this down to demand for real assets. Trusts focusing on renewable energy infrastructure raised \u00a31.1bn.</p><p>offerings, to suspend trading when there is \"material uncertainty\" around the value of illiquid holdings.</p><p>Other measures could yet emerge: Andrew Bailey, the FCA's chief executive, has suggested greater scrutiny around professional fund buy lists, for example. Given that many professional investors had fled the Woodford fund well before its suspension, from discretionary fund managers to pension funds, he has also revived an old idea of splitting retail and institutional assets. Meanwhile, the FCA and Bank of England are carrying out a joint probe into the risks of holding illiquid assets in open-ended funds.</p><p>Moving forward All of this could spell a solution. But for many in the industry it falls short of requirements. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at AJ Bell, describes the FCA's decision not to apply its latest rules to Ucits funds - a large chunk of the open-ended universe - as \"a missed opportunity\". He also believes the regulator faces an uphill struggle in changing the behaviour of investors.</p><p>\"The rules could mean funds suspend more frequently,\" he says. \"They are trying to take away the stigma of suspensions. The FCA is saying it's in your interests to suspend, but that's really hard to sell to investors, even if it's right.\"</p><p>Similar limits apply to any fund providers looking to remove the liquidity mismatch in open-ended funds, because asset managers are likely to receive sharp treatment if they abandon daily dealing.</p><p>\"The problem with daily dealing is that for a fund group, there's no first-mover advantage to changing from daily dealing to monthly dealing,\" Mr Hughes explains. \"If you are the lone voice saying that, you can guarantee that people will just switch out of that fund to something that's daily dealing, because they like the option of that access. If we want movement on daily dealing the only thing that will happen is from the regulator.\"</p><p>Responses to the IA's idea of a long-term asset fund give credence to his concerns. Interactive Investor, the platform, argued at the time the idea was initially mooted that investors should receive some additional benefit in exchange for less frequent dealing.</p><p>Investors have long wish lists when it comes to tackling the liquidity mismatch. This includes the regular publication of a fund's liquidity profile, detailing how long each portion of assets would take to sell. Another solution would be for the regulator, and investors themselves, to take a closer look at a fund's capacity, or how much money it can run before liquidity pressures come to bear.</p><p>When a fund becomes too big - a subject we discussed in the summer (see 'When funds get too big', IC, 30 August 2019) - it can struggle to establish worthwhile positions without owning too much of an asset. In the equity world, this can mean a fund manager inadvertently moving the price - something Mr Woodford has arguably done on both his good and bad days.</p><p>Fund managers can take measures to stem the inflow of money, from levying initial charges on new investors to simply dialing back marketing efforts. But Andrew Gilbert, investment manager at Parmenion, believes the FCA and regulator should take a \"stronger view\" on capacity, with limits on both fund sizes and the workload of investment managers.</p><p>\"If a manager is well known and everyone buys into them as a star manager, the company launches more funds for them to run. From an investor's perspective, if that fund had that track record over 10 years but just on one product and now they run 10, clearly they will be more distracted,\" he says. \"We need more firm boundaries around capacity and the number of mandates they can run.\"</p><p>Ben Conway, of Hawksmoor Investment Management, argues that a problem lies in funds managers' commercial objectives and how these run counter to those of underlying investors. Because asset managers charge fees on the level of assets they run, it makes sense to allow funds to grow even if this can create issues. He believes investors should look beyond blockbuster open-ended funds.</p><p>\"The more illiquid the asset class, the more likely you should use an investment trust,\" he says. \"If you have to go open-ended, pick a small fund.\"</p><p>However, investment trusts are not without their own problems, as outlined in the box below, while smaller open-ended funds could charge higher fees and even struggle to survive. Ultimately investors will need to accept that any illiquidity premium they receive is there for a reason.</p><p>\"What you need to understand if you want to invest is that when you buy illiquid assets for a greater return, there's a trade-off, and that trade-offis access,\" says Mr Hughes.</p><p>Patience can also pay offat times: funds run by H2O Asset Management, for example, were subject to liquidity concerns and investor redemptions earlier this year because of esoteric fixed-income holdings. But the funds successfully sold down these positions and never had to suspend trading.</p><p>Not all cases of suspension have ended in disaster, either. Open-ended property funds successfully Why Kent County Council pulled its cash Many professional investors had already withdrawn from the Equity Income fund before its suspension. Kent County Council's pension scheme remained invested despite some reservations - but the speed with which the fund was shrinking prompted it to look for the exit.</p><p>In a March 2019 meeting, the council's superannuation fund committee had resolved to reconsider the merits of its Woodford holding at another meeting, in late June. In the meantime the committee was set to have an unrelated update on the scheme's investment strategy at the end of May. But in the run-up to the end of May meeting the Woodford fund shrank by another \u00a3560m on the back of redemptions and poor performance.</p><p>\"The committee resolved unanimously that the council should seek to redeem the investment with immediate effect and should not wait until 21 June,\" a Kent County Council spokesman said. \"Consequently, steps were taken to make the necessary arrangements to redeem the investment on Monday 3 June. The announcement on Monday that trading in the investment fund was suspended was not anticipated.\"</p><p>Can investors reduce liquidity risk by using ETFs and investment trusts? Investment trusts are one popular route into less liquid assets: because a trust's shares are traded, it is not forced to give investors their money back if they wish to walk away. As noted, this is the main way many investors access illiquid assets and can give all parties involved a longer-term outlook.</p><p>That said, there is no silver bullet because investors have to take share price risk. They could see strong performers languishing on discounts or popular trusts looking too expensive if shares perform well - infrastructure trusts, for example, have recently tended to sit on a large premium to the value of their underlying assets. This means that if a trust is deeply out of favour, any investor determined to sell up can only do so by accepting the current price and potentially crystallising a loss.</p><p>Woodford Patient Capital is a good example of this: Woodford's decision to resign from the trust sent shares to a 50 per cent discount to the trust's net asset value.</p><p>Ms Lakshmanan adds that it can be difficult to trade trusts on platforms. As a result, trusts are becoming \"smaller and less liquid\", which can cause problems for those trading them.</p><p>ETFs can be easy to trade in and out of, but carry the same risks. There are also concerns that the sheer weight of money now sitting in ETFs could lead to heightened volatility in tough markets.</p><p>Is this the end of the road for superstar managers? Fund firms with 'star' managers have long faced the risk that assets will follow these employees out of the door if they depart. Because of this, many asset managers have already been moving to more teambased approaches in recent years, as well as lining up potential successors for popular managers and clearly telegraphing the retirement plans of older star names.</p><p>The Woodford debacle is likely to accelerate this shift, something Parmenion's Andrew Gilbert welcomes.</p><p>\"Your star fund manager had a degree of credibility and respect that people gave them the benefit of the doubt,\" he explains. \"There's less of that going around now. It's making it more quantitative and qualitative and taking out the emotional bias of individuals. \"I would emphasise the importance of the team. There's a tendency to ascribe the success of a fund to one individual, but it's an individual in a specific team and a specific company and a specific environment. You can't ascribe that past performance to them in future.\"</p><p>But some worry that, with running funds becoming more expensive, the Woodford fiasco has tarnished the name of active management and, with it, made it harder for talented managers to start their own businesses. \"An issue is the potential risk and the lack of innovation in the industry,\" says Jake Moeller, head of Lipper UK and Ireland research for Refinitiv. \"It's very difficult for a boutique fund house to get off the ground. We are talking about ones that don't have the goodwill of Woodford. Investors could think 'Woodford couldn't pull this off, so why would I back a small boutique?'\" reopened after their 2016 suspension, for example. But come difficult markets, risks remain. \"When you get a bear market, selling \u00a31 of bonds will still be as hard as selling \u00a310m,\" says Mr Conway. \"When there's no bid in the market, there's no bid in the market.\"</p><p>A protection checklist for investors It's entirely possible that new fund management scandals will emerge in the future. Investors will need to keep abreast of the regulatory developments as outlined in this article. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help make sure you are not caught: \u00a6 Choose the right vehicle. If you plan to invest in holdings that have a strong tendency to illiquidity such as private equity/unlisted companies or an asset class such as property, make sure you choose an appropriate vehicle. By choosing to invest in these types of holdings via closed-ended funds (investment trusts) and ETFs, you will always have an escape route because you will be able to sell your shares on the market. You might still suffer a loss, but you will not be locked into a fund at the mercy of the fund manager. However, see our box on page 29 on the risks of closed-ended vehicles.</p><p>\u00a6 Pay attention to liquidity. Before you buy, carefully read the fund sheet to understand exactly what you are investing in and what the mix of assets is. Train yourself to spot areas of illiquidity - for example, holdings that have an 'estimated value' rather than a market value. This is not to say that you shouldn't hold any illiquid investments, just that you should be prepared to stay invested for the long term.</p><p>\u00a6 Don't write offactive fund managers but don't allow yourself to be dazzled by the 'stars'. The more money you allocate to one fund or name, the more risk you heap onto your portfolio. Diversify across fund managers just as you would across geographies and sectors.</p><p>Make your Woodford losses work for you Investors caught in the Woodford crisis are expected to lose at least a third of their savings - but there is a way to put those losses to good use.</p><p>The first distribution of Woodford remains will be dished out \"by the end of January 2020\", according to Link Fund Solutions, its administrator, and investors are getting increasingly nervous about exactly how much they have lost. More than 300,000 are caught in the fund and risk losing at least a third of their savings, according to an analysis by PJT Park Hill, the investment bank brought in to offload its illiquid assets.</p><p>There's no knowing for sure until next year - but for investors who suffered from holding Woodford Equity, there is a way to make those losses work for you.</p><p>You can utilise your losses to offset gains and reduce capital gains tax (CGT) for this year and possibly in the future.</p><p>The annual exempt amount (AEA) for 2019-20 is \u00a312,000, which is the gain you can realise without incurring tax this year. Investment gains above this amount will be charged at 20 per cent for higher-rate taxpayers. For basic-rate taxpayers, your CGT will depend on the size of your gain and your taxable income. It will either be 10 per cent or 20 per cent.</p><p>If you held Woodford Equity, you can reduce your CGT bill by offsetting your losses against realised capital gains above the exempt amount.</p><p>There are some limitations to this. If you held Woodford within a tax-efficient wrapper, for example an individual savings account (Isa) or a self-invested personal pension (Sipp), you cannot utilise these losses against capital gains. The same applies if you held Woodford in venture capital trusts, enterprise investment schemes or some seed enterprise schemes.</p><p>But if you held the fund outside of these wrappers, you can claim the loss. \"If you realise a capital loss you need to put that on your tax return within four years,\" says Stefanie Tremain, director at Blick Rothenberg. So, even if your Woodford loss is not big enough to reduce your CGT bill yet, you must register it with HMRC by 2024. Once you have claimed the loss, it can be held indefinitely.</p><p>You should note that while your losses can be carried forward, they cannot be carried back against gains from earlier years.</p><p>Example Denise receives \u00a310,000 from Woodford in January 2020. She put \u00a317,000 into the fund in April 2018. She has no other disposals in 2020, so her \u00a37,000 loss is carried forward.</p><p>In June 2021, Denise disposes of shares in Company A for \u00a330,000. She paid \u00a313,500 for them in August 2017. Her chargeable gain is \u00a316,500.</p><p>Denise brings forward her previous loss to reduce her chargeable gains by \u00a34,500 to reach \u00a312,000, our hypothetical AEA for tax year 2020-21. She still has \u00a32,500 of unused losses available to use against gains in the future.</p><p>How do you claim? You need to complete form SA108 - declaring the total gains made during the year, the total losses made during the year and the losses left available to carry forward to future years. These losses are then deducted from other chargeable gains for the same year. Lauren Almeida</p><p/><p>Investors who choose to sell an open-ended fund are normally entitled to exchange their units in said fund for cash, and these funds tend to offer this on a daily basis. But this becomes a problem with equities that are unquoted and other illiquid assets, because of the mismatch between how long it takes to sell these and the speed with which a fund promises money back to investors. Because these assets cannot be sold quickly, and often cannot be sold for a significant period of time, they clog up the system when a fund is subjected to significant redemption requests.</p><p>Investment managers can be forced to sell their more liquid names, which can increase the proportion of assets they have in illiquids.

Indeed, the index has begun to rise again this week. Nonetheless, we think that it may be dawning on investors that the FOMC won't be able to shore up the economy very easily.</p><p>Last autumn's slump in the S&amp;P 500 was triggered by emerging concerns about the future health of the economy in the US, while demand in the rest of the world was weak. Although the incoming data in the US were generally still upbeat, investors began to worry that the FOMC would soon kill off the recovery if it tightened policy much more. So they sent the Committee, which at the time was still signalling the need for further rises in interest rates, a message not to overdo it: during this period, they all but factored out more hikes. </p><p>Of course, the message did not fall on deaf ears at the FOMC, which subsequently pledged to be \"patient\" when it came to making changes to interest rates in the future. Up until last week's FOMC meeting, investors took the view that this patience would prevent the US economy from slowing by as much as they had feared. So stock prices rebounded, while expected interest rates remained low. After the meeting, though, investors initially became unsettled again, even though expected interest rates fell even further as the FOMC reiterated its patient approach. This coincided with poor PMI data in the US and Europe.</p><p>Higgins thinks this unsettled period is here to stay:</p><p>This is because we think that the economy will struggle throughout this year and next, even as the FOMC ends up cutting rates by more than investors are now discounting in 2020. If we are right, the resilience of the stock market is unlikely to last and expectations for corporate earnings will probably be revised down much more heavily than they have been so far.

A quick recap: US consumer confidence has dropped unexpectedly, raising concerns that America's economy is slowing. Weak US house-building data also suggested caution is building in the world's largest economy. In the UK, mortgage approvals fell (but not as much as we first thought!). German consumer confidence also took a knock, suggesting recent stalled growth has worried the population. Profit warnings from plumbing and heating firm Ferguson, cruise operator Carnival, tech giant Samsung and luxury consumer electronics maker Bang &amp; Olufsen also reminded investors that the world economy is in a soft patch. But... markets rallied on both sides of the Atlantic, with gains in Japan too, amid hopes of a US-China trade deal and a Brexit breakthrough. Goodnight! GW Wall Street has closed higher tonight, following Europe's lead. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 140 points, or 0.5%, to 25,657. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both gained 0.7%. Marketwatch has a worrying report tonight, about the rise in evictions in America -- with some being used by predatory landlords to accrue more fees. They report: Nearly half of Americans are \"rent-burdened,\" which means that they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Homelessness is on the rise. Nationally, as many as one in seven children may have experienced eviction in the last decade. And, just as the foreclosure crisis disproportionately hit African-Americans, so does the eviction epidemic. Black women in Milwaukee, for example, were evicted at a rate three times their share of the population, and black renters in metro Seattle were evicted four times as frequently as whites there, according to earlier research.... More here: The eviction crisis is starting to look a lot like the subprime mortgage crisis Our latest Brexit dashboard, tracking the health of the UK economy each month, is live. And it shows that... MPs are entering the crunch phase of the Brexit process against a backdrop of better news from the British economy, despite growing alarm over the political deadlock and the lingering risk of a no-deal departure from the European Union, according to the latest Guardian analysis. The Guardian's monthly tracker of economic news showed employment reaching the highest levels on record and consumers continuing to spend on the high street, even as Britain's departure from the EU looms..... European stock markets have ended the day in the green, but it's not much of a rally. The FTSE 100 gained 18 points to 7196, after two days of losses. Germany's DAX gained 0.6%. France's CAC 40 was the best performer, rising by 0.9% -- Airbus lifted the index after securing a major Chinese contract win (announced as president Xi visits France). Howard Archer of EY Item Club cautions that Britain's housing market is still fragile, even though mortgage lending wasn't has weak as feared. He writes: UK Finance have reported that the mortgage approvals data they released this morning were incorrect and have released revised data that show the drop in mortgage approvals for house purchases in February was much less marked than had been originally indicated. Obviously this suggest that Brexit uncertainties had less of a negative impact on housing market activity in February than had first seemed to be the case. Nevertheless, we suspect that the extended Brexit uncertainty will impact on the housing market. Newsflash: Britain's housing market is NOT as weak as we reported this morning. UK Finance have just revised their earlier figures, having spotted a mistake in the seasonal adjusted data. They now say that lenders approved 39,083 home loans in February, down from 39,910 in January. So, just a small decline. That's significantly better than the plunge to 35,299 which they initially reported - which would have been the worst reading since 2013. Obviously mistakes happen, but this is rather unfortunate for UK Finance - especially as the pound seems to weaken when the figures was released. Market-moving data needs to be right first time! Especially in the current political climate. John Higgins of Capital Economics has a warning for investors - the US stock market is heading for a fall. He predicts that the rally seen since late December will fizzle out, as traders realise growth is slowing, and that America's central bankers (the FOMC) can't keep the economy afloat. If so, US stocks could lose a fifth of their value by the end of the year. Higgins writes: The sell-off in the S&amp;P 500 late last week may have just reflected a short-lived bout of profit-taking after a strong run. Indeed, the index has begun to rise again this week. Nonetheless, we think that it may be dawning on investors that the FOMC won't be able to shore up the economy very easily. Last autumn's slump in the S&amp;P 500 was triggered by emerging concerns about the future health of the economy in the US, while demand in the rest of the world was weak. Although the incoming data in the US were generally still upbeat, investors began to worry that the FOMC would soon kill off the recovery if it tightened policy much more. So they sent the Committee, which at the time was still signalling the need for further rises in interest rates, a message not to overdo it: during this period, they all but factored out more hikes. Of course, the message did not fall on deaf ears at the FOMC, which subsequently pledged to be \"patient\" when it came to making changes to interest rates in the future. Up until last week's FOMC meeting, investors took the view that this patience would prevent the US economy from slowing by as much as they had feared. So stock prices rebounded, while expected interest rates remained low. After the meeting, though, investors initially became unsettled again, even though expected interest rates fell even further as the FOMC reiterated its patient approach. This coincided with poor PMI data in the US and Europe. Higgins thinks this unsettled period is here to stay: This is because we think that the economy will struggle throughout this year and next, even as the FOMC ends up cutting rates by more than investors are now discounting in 2020. If we are right, the resilience of the stock market is unlikely to last and expectations for corporate earnings will probably be revised down much more heavily than they have been so far. This is largely why we are sticking to our view that the S&amp;P 500 will end this year at 2,300, which is nearly 20% below its level now. Finally, the rebound in the S&amp;P 500 so far in 2019 has been almost the mirror image of the sell-off last autumn across most sectors. Only real estate and utilities (on the upside) and energy (on the downside) have bucked the trend. As the index comes under renewed pressure, we expect to see another broad-based sell-off, led by cyclicals once again. Despite the steady drip of poor economic data, and weak company results, US and European stock markets are both rallying. The FTSE 100 is up around 0.35% as the final hour of trading ticks on. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 1% as lunch looms. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says traders have been cheered by signs that some MPs are moving to back Theresa May's Brexit deal: Global equities rebounded from the four day sell off, surging higher on Tuesday. A recovery in US treasury yields, combined with the possibility of a positive conclusion for Brexit and US - Sino trade negotiations has encouraged investors to take a more optimistic outlook on the economy; pushing recession fears back. Several economists and analysts fear that the fall in US consumer confidence may show America's economy is weakening. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, says stock market volatility, weak jobs data and the Federal government shutdown have all hit consumer confidence. She explains: \"Confidence has been somewhat volatile over the past few months, as consumers have had to weather volatility in the financial markets, a partial government shutdown and a very weak February jobs report. The overall trend in confidence has been softening since last summer, pointing to a moderation in economic growth.\" Newsflash: US consumer confidence has fallen, adding to the flurry of negative economic data of late. The Confidence Board's index of American consumer morale has slipped sharply this month, to 124.1, from 131.4 in February, dashing hopes of a rise to 132. US citizens said they were more pessimistic about future prospects, and finding conditions tougher than a month ago. Here's the details: Present situation confidence: down to 160.6 vs 172.8 last month Consumer confidence expectations: down to 99.8 vs 103.8 last month Consumer confidence had been pretty buoyant last year, as the Trump tax cuts boosted spending and share prices. This boost appears to be fading.... We have our FOURTH profits warning of the day. Cruise operator Carnival has cut its earnings forecast for 2019, warning that higher fuel prices and the stronger dollar will hurt profitability. CEO Arnold Donald told shareholders that \"fuel price and currency moving against us\" would knock $155m off earnings this year. As such, Carnival now expects adjusted earnings of $4.35 to $4.55 per share in 2019, compared with $4.50 to $4.80 estimated before Donald insist that demand for cruises is holding up well, saying: \"Booking trends achieved during wave season rivaled last years' historical highs and were consistent with the demand trends we experienced going into the year, building further confidence in our full year guidance. For our North America and Australia brands, our booked position is ahead of the prior year at higher prices while our Europe and Asia brands are well ahead of the prior year at lower prices. This follows the profit warning from electronics giant Samsung overnight, and from luxury speaker and TV maker Bang &amp; Olufson and plumbing and heating firm Ferguson this morning. Shares in Carnival have now slumped by 7%. Wall Street has opened higher, as investors try to put recent losses behind them. As the chimes of the opening bell fade, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 209 points at 25,726, a gain of 0.8%. The tech-focused Nasdaq is also starting the day well, up almost 1%. Apple has risen by 1.4%, as investors react to last night's announcements of new video-streaming and computer gaming services. Some reaction to the sharp fall in US house-building last month: Heads-up. UK Finance have now said that some of the mortgage and credit data released this morning is incorrect. We should have updated figures soon #developing Newsflash: America's housing market also appears to have weakened. The number of construction projects to build new US homes slumped by 8.7% last month, to its lowest rate in more than 18 months, the Commerce Department says. That may be partly due to bad weather (February was unusually cold in some states, and pretty wet in others), or it may show that American builders are feeling cautious. The number of building permits issued fell 1.6%, the second monthly drop in a row, which feels like another gloomy indicator. The pound is shaking off its earlier losses, and pushing higher as some Brexiteer MPs suggest they could back Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement. Both Jacob Rees-Mogg and Michael Fabricant have said they now believe parliament must choose between May's deal and no Brexit. That's potentially significant, as they both voted against the deal previously. It's pushed sterling up to $1.325, a gain of half a cent today. However, even if the Brexity European Reform Group do switch, May also needs the DUP to back the deal -- or persuade some more Labour MP to support her in a third Meaningful Vote. Andy Sparrow's Politics Live blog has all the action: While mortgage approvals fell, credit card lending jumped last month. UK consumers borrowed \u00a3245m more on their credit cards in February, up from \u00a3160m in January, UK Finance say. That may show that households have been forced to put essential purchases on credit, despite the pick-up in wages recently. Alternatively, it could mean people are so confident about the future that they're happily melting the plastic. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour's Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, suspects its the former: \"The Conservatives have created an economy with spiralling personal debt, at the same time as wages of those at the top skyrocket. \"With average real wages still below pre-crisis levels, this is clearly an economy working for the few and not the many. \"Labour will act to stamp out the scourge of high personal debt and introduce a real living wage of at least \u00a310 per hour.\" Here's a chart showing how the UK housing market stumbled last month, with mortgage approvals and net lending both lower. The slump in UK mortgage approvals highlights the \"Brexit malaise gripping the housing market\", agrees Bloomberg. It says: The weaker-than-expected figures underscore the impact Brexit uncertainty is having on the housing market, particularly in London where property prices are falling outright amid the worst slump since the financial crisis a decade ago. Economist Howard Archer of the EY Item Club points out that London and the South East of England is suffering the brunt of the housing slowdown. Here's his take on February's weak mortgage approvals: UK Finance mortgage approvals for house purchases point to the housing market currently being very much on the back foot. Specifically, mortgage approvals for house purchases fell back sharply to 35,299 in February, which was the lowest level since April 2013. This was down markedly from 39,555 in January and took mortgage approvals well below the 38,000-40,000 range that largely held through 2018 The February UK Finance mortgage data fuel belief that heightened Brexit uncertainties are currently weighing down appreciably on the housing market, and reinforcing already relatively challenging conditions - although there are varying performances across regions with the overall national picture dragged down by the poor performance in London and parts of the South East. Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, agrees that political uncertainty is hurting the housing market. He hopes the UK housing market might pick up when (or if?) we have more clarity on the UK's departure from the EU. 'On the high street, business continues to be tough with only realistic buyers and sellers taking advantage of the situation. Once the obstacles to Brexit clarity are removed, then we feel further pent-up demand will inevitably be released.' Economists are warning that the UK housing market has slowed, and it's probably going to get worse... In another sign of weakness, UK mortgage lending growth has hit a near-three low. Net mortgge lending rose by \u00a3711m in February, down from \u00a3801m in January. The surprise fall in UK mortgage approvals has hit the pound, sending sterling down almost half a cent to $1.316. Newsflash: UK mortgage approvals have fallen to their lowest level in almost six years. Just 35,299 new loans for houser purchases were agreed in February, according to new figures from industry body UK Finance. That's down from 39,555 in January, and is the weakest level since April 2013. City economists had expected a small pick-up in mortgage approvals, to around 39,600, as the market warmed up after the traditional Christmas lull. So this may show that potential purchasers are sitting tight until Brexit is resolved, or simply unable to stump up enough money to move. More to follow... High end TV and stereo maker Bang &amp; Olufsen is also under the cosh today. Shares in the luxury Danish consumer electronics maker have plunged by over 20% this morning, after it issued its second sale warning this year. B&amp;O admitted that full-year revenues are expected to plunge by 10% this year. Back in December, it said they would be flat -- news which slashed a third of its value. Following today's blow, economist Per Hansen of Nordnet declared that B&amp;O now faces \"a real crisis of confidence.\" B&amp;Os products are resolutely targeted at wealthier consumers. Its Bluetooth headphones cost more than \u00a3200, while its wireless speakers come with a four-figure price tag. Beautiful, undoubtedly, but also vulnerable to economic angst. Another profits warning! This time from Ferguson, the FTSE 100 plumbing and heating equipment supplier. Ferguson has warned shareholders that market conditions have deteriorated recently, hitting earnings, so profits will be at the lower end of expectations. It now expect organic revenue growth to slow to between 3 and 5%, down from 6.8% in the last six months. Ferguson operates in the US, UK and Canada, so is a good bellwether of economic prospects in those countries.... Shares have slumped almost 9% this morning, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Online grocery chain Ocado is bucking the gloom. Shares in Ocado have jumped 4%, after it announced another international tie-up -- this time with Australia's Coles. The \u00a380m deal will give Coles access to Ocado's technology platform for grocery delivery, with the UK firm building and maintaining to automated warehouses in Australia. That's a timely boost for Ocado, just weeks after its warehouse in Hampshire suffered a massive blaze. With little good news this morning, it's no surprise that European stock markets are flat in early trading. The UK's FTSE 100, the German DAX and the French CAC are all becalmed are investors ponder the health of the eurozone economy. South Korean tech firm Samsung has stunned traders overnight with a surprise profit warning, due to a slide in memory chip prices. The world's largest smartphone seller warned that it will market estimates for the first quarter of this year, due to amid falling prices for LCD screens and semi-conductors. In a regulatory filing, it revealed: \"The company expects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected.\" Chip prices have been hit by weaker-than-expected sales of new phones such as the iPhone X, and the general economic slowdown. So Samsung's profit warning could be a significant sign that Big Tech is hitting tough times..... especially as this is its second profit warning in three months. More eurozone gloom! French industrial confidence has fallen to its lowest level in almost two and a half years. The INSEE statistics agency has just reported that its monthly industrial confidence index fell to 102 points this month, from 103 in February. That's the lowest reading since November 2016. It's another sign that manufacturers are in the doldrums. More encouragingly, service sector firms are more positive, nudging INSEE's broader measure of private sector confidence up to 104 from 103. Reuters reckons French firms are shaking off their worries about the \"yellow vest\" protests: Business confidence plunged in December after a series of protests over the high cost of living turned violent, sparking some of the worst rioting and vandalism in decades during the peak pre-holiday shopping season. While confidence in the dominant service sector was stable in March, it rebounded in the wholesale industry and was unchanged in retail. This drop in German consumer confidence is particularly disappointing, as we learned yesterday that business leaders were more optimistic. Here's some early reaction: Newsflash: German consumer confidence has taken a knock, adding to concerns that the eurozone economy is struggling. Market research group GfK has reported that morale deteriorated this month, with Germans saying they are rather less willing to splash out on new goods. The survey of around 2,000 Germans showed that income expectations fell slightly and propensity to buy dropped to its lowest level since December 2016. This dragged GfK's consumer sentiment index down to 10.4, worse than forecasts of 10.8, and down from 10.7 a month ago. That will add to anxiety that the global economy is running short of steam. Germany's economy has been struggling for several months, as its exporters have been caught up in America's trade dispute with China, and the EU. GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl explains: Whilst consumers are certainly not assuming that Germany will fall into recession this year, they do see a noticeable cooling off of economic activity. Buerkl also fears that Brexit has spooked German consumers...and could continue to act as a drag on the economy: The lack of decisiveness regarding the nature and date of the UK's exit from the EU, as well as the growing trade conflict between the EU and USA are clearly creating ever more uncertainty among consumers. Barriers to trade, such as increases in customs duties, are currently creating a burden for German exports. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets continue to be gripped by anxiety that we could be heading towards a recession. After two days of losses, there's a rather jittery feeling in the City today. Shares might nudge higher, but there's not much momentum behind any rally. Asian markets are looking rather mixed too -- China's Shanghai Composite has shed 1.5% today, while Japan's Nikkei has bounced back from Monday's rout (-3%) with a 2% gain. With the eurozone slowing, China struggling to reach a trade deal with America, and the UK bogged down in unending Brexit mess, there's little to cheer investors. And the recent steady decline in government bond yields (as nervous traders drive bond prices higher) is fuelling the tensions. After a surge of money into US Treasuries, longer-term US debt is now offering a worse return than short-dated bonds. That suggests markets are pricing in a sharp slowdown, perhaps even a recession. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Investors are aware the US economy is in rude health, and growth is tipped to cool in 2019, but at the same time they don't want to ignore the moves in yield curve inversion as it been a reliable recession indicator. On the corporate side, City traders will have drinks on their mind as tonic maker Fevertree and Irn-Bru brewer AG Barr report financial results, along with United Utilities and formal wear outfit Moss Bros. We'll also get a healthcheck on the US economy, with new consumer confidence and house price data. Are Americans feeling more chipper than their German friends?

Biden Jr., Trump's potential Democratic opponent, threatened to withhold $1 billion from Ukraine unless its government fired a prosecutor investigating an energy company with ties to Biden's son, Hunter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ad won't be seen on CNN, which says it will not air it because it \"makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it will be seen widely on Facebook, the social media site that, more than any other, was critical to the Russian online disinformation campaign designed to influence the 2016 election. Facebook has sought to downplay any responsibility for the outcome of the contest and has taken steps to crack down on \"fake news\" ahead of 2020.</p><p>\"We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos,\" wrote Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communications, in a Sept. 24 blog post.</p><p>He continued: \"We don't believe, however, that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\"</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, was more succinct in an Oct. 17 speech at Georgetown University.</p><p>\"I don't think people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies decide are 100 percent true,\" he said.</p><p>The ad, therefore, would remain on Facebook's platform despite its unproven allegations, in clear view of its targeted audience. As of late May, Trump's campaign had already paid Facebook about $5 million for advertising, according to a New York Times analysis, and reaching voters via the platform, which has 1.6 billion users globally, is expected to be a cornerstone of his reelection effort. One of Facebook's top critics, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is vying with Biden for the Democratic nomination, has called Facebook's policy on political ads a \"disinformation-for-profit machine.\"</p><p>The decision by Facebook to allow the ad, and its policies for content moderation in general, raise questions about technology platforms' responsibility to crack down on domestic and foreign disinformation, and the consequences if they don't. Critics on both sides of the political aisle have posed similar questions about platforms that host violent content or content that could be considered hate speech, such as a racist manifesto posted to the fringe website 8chan by a gunman who killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, in August.</p><p>At the center of the debate is a 1996 law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, that gives technology companies, including social media platforms, broad immunity from liability for third-party content posted on their sites. That includes paid advertisements, such as the Trump campaign's Biden video, courts have found.</p><p>In the two decades since its creation, the statute has been credited with allowing Silicon Valley to thrive and enabling freedom of expression online. But it also allows platforms significant cover for their hosting of \"fake news,\" which has renewed interest in possible changes to the law.</p><p>\"One of the main goals of Section 230 in 1996 was to give platforms the flexibility to implement effective content moderation systems,\" says Jeff Kosseff, a law professor at the U.S. Naval Academy and author of a book about the law, \"The 26 Words That Created The Internet.\"</p><p>\"What happened in 2016,\" Kosseff says, \"had a big effect on the political debate because it highlighted the less-than-perfect content moderation systems that platforms have.\"</p><p>But the path forward is muddled. For instance, proposals by Republicans to change Section 230 are largely driven by unproven allegations that content moderation at companies like Facebook and Twitter is biased against conservatives. Another issue is that, even if Section 230 were abolished, the First Amendment would still protect most third-party content, including hate speech and fake news.</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who helped write Section 230, says getting rid of the law in an effort to curb disinformation would not have the desired effect. In an interview with Recode's Kara Swisher last year, Wyden said the law was envisioned as a shield from liability for early entrepreneurs, but \"also a sword to deal with irresponsible conduct.\"</p><p>\"Part of the reason the companies are in so much trouble,\" Wyden told Swisher, \"is that they haven't been using the sword.\"</p><p>Revisiting the Deal</p><p>As focus on the companies' content moderation practices has ballooned, so has interest in Section 230, and what steps might be taken to change it.</p><p>\"The political consensus around Section 230 that's existed for the last 10 years or so is really starting to break down,\" says Tim Hwang, a technologist and researcher who has written about disinformation for Stanford University's Project on Democracy and the Internet. \"Folks on both sides of the aisle are interested in revisiting the deal that was struck.\"</p><p>Kosseff says that for the first two decades of its existence, Section 230 was \"treated as almost a birthright by the platforms.\"</p><p>\"They got really arrogant about it and they did not meet their responsibility as good corporate citizens, which was kind of assumed by the passage of Section 230, that they would take an approach that protects their users and society,\" Kosseff says.</p><p>Then came the 2016 election, and with it increased scrutiny of Big Tech. Since then, the House Judiciary Committee, Federal Trade Commission and a slew of state attorneys general have begun investigating possible violations of antitrust law by companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon. Social media executives have testified before Congress about limiting violent or extremist content on their platforms. And they have been questioned about steps taken to curb the spread of disinformation.</p><p>In April, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described Section 230 as a \"gift\" to platforms and said she didn't think they \"are treating it with the respect that they should.\"</p><p>\"It is not out of the question that that could be removed,\" Pelosi said of the section.</p><p>Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who is often Pelosi's ideological opposite, in June introduced legislation that would revoke automatic Section 230 privileges for large technology companies and instead require them to earn it by submitting to a government audit that would determine their political neutrality. (Hawley and other Republicans, like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have claimed Section 230 immunity is incumbent on neutrality, although there's nothing about neutrality in the statute's language.)</p><p>But neither approach would do much to directly target the spread of disinformation on the platforms.</p><p>\"There are two very different views about platforms and Section 230 that are really hard to reconcile,\" says Kosseff.</p><p>On one hand, he says, Republicans are accusing platforms of doing too much moderating, and doing it in an anti-conservative way. On the other, Democrats say the platforms aren't monitoring enough and that too much disinformation is being allowed to spread.</p><p>Disinformation can be spread by liberals and conservatives alike, though experts suggests a majority of online fake news comes from right-wing users and sources. Research published in March by New York University's Center for Business and Human Rights found disinformation to be a \"predominantly right-wing phenomenon.\" The \"radicalized right,\" according to scholars at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, has played a central role \"in creating the current crisis of disinformation and misinformation.\"</p><p>\"What one person considers to be legitimate political discourse, another could consider it to be hate speech,\" Kosseff says. \"And you have the platforms in the middle saying what do we keep and what do we get rid of? They're not going to make everyone happy no matter what they do.\"</p><p>Aversion to Section 230, argues Hwang, \"opens the door to point-of-view neutrality, which in practice is very difficult to implement and may raise a number of constitutional concerns.\"</p><p>In a speech at The Atlantic Festival in Washington on Sept. 24, Facebook's Clegg acknowledged that the company \"made mistakes in 2016, and that Russia tried to use Facebook to interfere with the election by spreading division and misinformation.\"</p><p>But the company had \"learned the lessons of 2016,\" Clegg said, and \"spent the three years since building its defenses to stop that happening again.\"</p><p>He said Facebook is preventing the creation of millions of fake accounts, known as bots, each day. The company has also contracted with independent fact-checkers and hired 30,000 content moderators. It's also exploring ways to use artificial intelligence to detect and cull dangerous content.</p><p>In some ways, this type of behavior is what the authors of Section 230 had in mind, the \"sword\" to which Wyden referred.</p><p>\"One of the main goals of Section 230 was to give platforms the flexibility to implement effective content moderation systems,\" says Kosseff, although it's hard to know whether Facebook's tactics are proving effective.</p><p>There are also political realities with which to contend. Big technology companies are increasingly unpopular among the American public and are \"starting to realize that if they don't clean up their act, Section 230 is not going to be here,\" Kosseff says.</p><p>Hwang predicts that the government may eventually have to step in if \"it feels like the companies aren't doing a good job.\"</p><p>\"The reality is that regardless of all the investments companies have made, by and large the public still feels like they haven't done enough,\" he says.</p><p>More than half of Americans believe social media companies \"spread lies and falsehoods, compared with only 30 percent that say they're a source for real news, according to polling published in April by NBC and the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Furthermore, some current content moderation practices, especially those aimed at deciding what news is fake and what news is real, make for a slippery slope. Abolishing Section 230 could exacerbate such difficulties.</p><p>\"Attempts to monitor the truth value of things or create a wholly objective truth monitor are projects doomed to fail,\" Hwang says.</p><p>One alternative to changing Section 230 would be legislation designed to crack down on what Hwang calls \"unfair competition in the marketplace of ideas,\" or practices that, when paired with a disinformation campaign, can have a greater effect on a debate than a single piece of fake news. One such practice might be the use of bots, or fake online accounts.</p><p>\"It doesn't matter if those bots are left-leaning, right-leaning, truthful or spreading disinformation,\" he says. \"The fact is that you're using bots and that's the real harm.\"</p><p>But for the most part, legislative efforts to curb disinformation by abolishing or replacing Section 230 are unlikely to have the desired effect. By the time Congress can pass an anti-disinformation law, Hwang predicts, those spreading disinformation will have already found a way around it.</p><p>\"We don't want to hard-code these things into legislation,\" he says.</p><p>How, then, should a society suffering from an overflow of fake news proceed?</p><p>\"I take a lot of inspiration from the domain of computer security, where we really have a community of practice around defense,\" Hwang says. \"My optimistic view is that civil society and independent researchers take up the banner here to figure out what we need to do, even as the broader regulatory solution is being worked out. And I think that's going to be necessitated by 2020.\"</p><p>Source: CQ Magazine<br/>Copyright 2019 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

It's just that bits and pieces of the dotcom era have been crumbling down around us for a while now, and when I read about these two particular chunks of debris, it made me wonder what was left of that once sturdy edifice, The Boom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first of the fallen is Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) investment banker Frank Quattrone, once the firm's highest flier. Mr Quattrone was big, big, big in Silicon Valley, and then in New York. He worked for a succession of big investment banks; his name featured in all the Valley party gossip. He did the Netscape IPO, the most famous of the dotcom era.</p><section sectionType=\"slug\"><bodyText><p>03030700186</p></bodyText></section><p>Pretty much single-handedly, he made CSFB the fattest banking cat on Wall Street with his deft hand with technology company initial public offerings.</p><p>Well, that's what he did before the firm came under investigation for its IPO deals by the SEC and the National Association of Securities Dealers.</p><p>Over two years, there was to-ing, there was fro-ing. There were denials of wrongdoing, ever, at any time. Then last week, Mr Quattrone failed to show up before a regulatory panel that wanted to talk a bit more about those banking deals, and perhaps a bit about why he asked colleagues to destroy files before they headed off on their December holidays.</p><p>The firm began issuing ominous statements such as \"CSFB's policy requires an employee's full co-operation with regulators\" and then mentioned that dread phrase \"appropriate action\".</p><p>Mr Quattrone was also the target of two criminal investigations in New York.</p><p>The New York Times laid out some of the issues: \"From his perch in Credit Suisse's office in Palo Alto, California, Mr Quattrone flouted the traditional barriers separating the disparate areas of the Wall Street firm. Nominally an investment banker in charge of bringing hot technology companies public, he also held sway over a captive research department, ensuring companies he took public received positive coverage, e-mails collected by prosecutors now show.\"</p><p>Tuesday, Mr Quattrone resigned from CSFB. He'll apparently work out his severance pay and share allocations once the charges against him have been resolved.</p><p>The second fallen entity is Red Herring magazine, which quietly announced it was shutting down this week, just as it was approaching its 10th anniversary. Red Herring rode precisely the rise and fall of the technology sector as the share darling of Wall Street.</p><p>Initially a slim publication written primarily for the venture capitalist and investment audience in Silicon Valley, it began to gain girth as the industry it covered took off in the mid-1990s. The magazine and companion website became the insider view of the Valley, and I became one of many journalists who scanned its online version regularly to see who was hot, and what new technology and technology company looked to be going incandescent.</p><p>At its height, it was bloated with advertising and even switched to bi-weekly publication, so many were the topics and companies to be covered, the ad revenue to haul in. Every issue featured a beaming chief executive who seemed to grow ever younger.</p><p>A big chief executive catch on the cover upped the advertisement haul - one issue featuring Bill Gates was so heavy that the postman wouldn't carry it to my house and instead left one of those small packet notices through my door.</p><p>Eventually I too got the call from the Herring. With all those pages to fill with copy - something, after all, had to surround the swarm of tech advertisements - they needed writers, even those based thousands of miles away in Europe. I did one story, was paid phenomenally well (enough to buy a decent laptop with the cheque - I nearly choked), and never got around to writing for them again, though they asked.</p><p>Not that all this was terribly flattering or ego-inflating. I was well aware that at the very height of the boom, they really needed writers who either knew something about business and could learn a bit about tech, or writers who knew something about tech and could fudge the business bit.</p><p>As a matter of fact, I've always thought one contribution to the development of the dotcom hypefest was all those business writers trying to cover technology they didn't understand, and all those tech writers fumbling their way through and adding some business spin.</p><p>This suspicion was confirmed when my cousin, a Japanese-speaking engineer who was a stellar vice-president of sales for a flurry of Valley tech companies, heard I was writing for Red Herring. \"Wow, all the venture capitalists read that magazine!\" he said appreciatively, waiting for me to drop my insider hints on what to buy, hold and sell. Moi? I think not.</p><p>In 2000, the Herring had 350 staff, and advertising revenue of $ 87 million. It closed this week without ever printing its 10th anniversary issue, with 31 staff, and advertising revenue of $ 15.6 million.</p><p>One person who did get that mix of business and technology was the magazine's co-founder, who bailed out in enough time to make some money off the magazine. He also co-wrote a book that investors ignored during the boom. Called The Internet Bubble: Inside the Overvalued World of High-Tech Stocks and What You Need To Know To Avoid the Coming Shakeout, it was published at the end of 1999, just before the crest.

He's pulled in some big tech names as interviewees and participants in online discussions. Check it out.</p><p>Two different tales from the Valley and the Boom, and both show what's left of the dotcom edifice.</p><p>In one corner, someone sitting among lots of rubble.
